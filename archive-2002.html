Cuba Criticizes Plan

December 30, 2001 

By REUTERS


 

HAVANA, Dec. 29 (Reuters) - Cuban officials objected today
to Washington's plans for housing Taliban and Al Qaeda
prisoners at the American Navy base at Guantanamo Bay. 

Cuba's attorney general, Juan Escalona, scoffed at the
plan, announced Thursday by Secretary of Defense Donald H.
Rumsfeld to bring detainees from the conflict in
Afghanistan half-way around the world to the base on Cuba's
southeast tip. 

"It's another provocation from the Americans," Mr. Escalona
said. "I hope 15 or 20 get out and kill them." 

While condemning the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States,
Havana has also opposed the bombardment of Afghanistan,
calling it barbaric.

Imperialism, Class Warfare &amp; The National Elections: Nov2000
- Amiri Baraka (published before the 2000 election)

IMPERIALISM &amp; THE NATIONAL ELECTIONNS; CAUGHT BETWEEN A SERIAL
KILLER &amp; A PROSTITUTE, OR BEAT BUSH (NIX NADER), DEMAND MORE FROM
GORE!

Gore and Bush conflict around the use of public moneys because Gore
represents bank and industrial capital and the superstructural
combination, that shapes US monopoly, but as a bulky associate of
world monopoly in its more "rational" as the present mode confirmed
by International Finance Capital) international mores and forms.
Gore would not take money out of the public coffers at the same rate
as Bush, because Gores economic ideological base profits from the
revenues in public institutions. Banks, Insurance Companies, Trusts,
Bureaucracy, Wall St, Money Managers, Trade Revenues.

Bush is Oil, Cheney Oil. Annexationist, more reactionary since they
ride the oil juggernaut which still propose an"independent" US
power, as the White Cowboy Savage of Free Western (hemispheric and
US factual mythology) Post European Christendom. Like the mad
general in Dr Strangelove, they want to ride the big bomb of oil as
the single back offense of an invincible, sanctified ground game.

Bush would take more public funds because the privatization he
projects is into the interests, which bulk big oil. The
international politics, ironically, would use Israel as long as the
oil is safe, like Olivier in Marathon Man, "Is it Safe?" But if Arab
political upsurge began to dominate, Bushites would, like the
British, after they gave permission through Rothchild for the
Zionists to take Palestine, switch their allegiance without a blink.
Do the American Jews realize this? The Zionists are determined this
will never happen, but by their action not their trust.

But the fact that Bush thinks the US is still in a position economically, 
politically, militarily, to be the independent Tarzan of the world, reflects 
a nostalgia Imperialism that is most vicious because it is outdated and the 
main economic institutions think is dangers. Otherwise, why would the NY 
Times, W Post, S Ledger, &amp;c back Gore? Prosperity is here, don't mess with 
it, don't fix what don't need, &amp;c. Although they do admire the massive 
appetite Bush projects, part of that belongs to the present associations and 
alliances of international finance capital. And they understand they are not 
Tarzan, anymore, even collectively, but more like Jungle Jim. At least put 
your clother on.

NADER-GREEN PARTY EMERGE AS A SUBURBAN CHAUVINIST RIGHT WING LIBERAL 
PETTY-BOURGEOISIE &amp; WAGE CLASS WARFARE AGAINST THE WORKING CLASS, OPPRESSED 
NATIONALITIES &amp; WOMEN WITH "LEFT" PHRASEMONGERING &amp; METAPHYSICAL 
"BOYCOTTISM"

Nader and the Greens are now revealed as not the Left but the Right social 
democrats or the Menshevik sub-alterns of vanished Liberalism,, rural(now 
suburban) petty bourgeoisie, with their "Left" phrase mongering when they 
admit (Nader Ad, NYTIMES, Oct26,00) a vote for Nader will accomplish nothing 
except "anti-establishment" hocus pocus "feelgoodism". They have not even 
the ingenuousness of the no and gleefully acknowledge it.

They use the romantic misunderstanding of Boycottism, in essence, by 
providing a Don Quixote quest with which to subtract votes from the only 
option existing that can BEAT BUSH. To say "there is no difference" between 
Bush 2 &amp; Gore" is the phrase mongering of juvenile delinquent infantile 
"left" untruths, as unscientific as their politics, here rooted either in 
yahoo ignorance or the brooding demagoguery of the political swindler. 
Affirmative Action, Social Security, Health Care, Tax Cuts, Education, 
Confederate Flag, Legal Murder of the working class, women, gays, 
anti-immigration, non-stop privatization.

In a recent NY Times article (Oct31) Nader is quoted saying 1st, "he doesn't 
like the word "Liberal, he prefers "Progressive". Probably because it is 
more vague! He mentions as important aspects of his "platform" Opposing 
drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge....." He criticized Gore 
saying "he had done nothing to force auto makers to make cars more fuel 
efficient."

He then modifies his disingenuous description that there's no difference 
between Gore and Bush, saying, "there are few major differences"/ Saying 
that the worst thing about the two parties was the was they coxied up to the 
special interests and encouraged a concentration of power made all other 
distinctions meaningless. "I don't care if they different on everything 
else"

Of the Supreme Court, Nader continues his amazing petty-bourgeois solipsism 
and establishes his "radicalness" as merely the whimpers of the "loyal 
opposition, saying, re: Bush's Supreme Court appointments would overthrow 
Roe v Wade, making abortions illegal, "You cant really predict how Supreme 
Court justices will behave....". He tops this disgusting dismissal of 
practical politics by confirming that he has no understanding of Democratin 
Struggle and is objectively in opposition to the needs of Blacks, Latino's, 
Women, Gays, when he says of Roe v Wade, that if Bush did overthrow it, "it 
would just revert to the states". Apparently not understanding or not caring 
that one of the most consistent of Democratic struggle of the Afro American 
People, Immigrants, Women, &amp;c is the fight against STATES RIGHTS Long used 
by Racists and Right Wing Politicians to oppose democracy!

This fig leaf of opportunism masquerading as militancy is torn away by the 
projected results of their dangerous vaudeville. But also, most graphically, 
by Nader, &amp;c dismissal of the actuality of U.S. Imperialism, and the needs 
of the working class and oppressed peoples, instead he laughingly 
acknowledges that his "campaign" could elect Bush2 This is not serious to 
him and them, because such National Liberal Chauvinists actually have no 
real fundamental problens with Imperialism and National Oppression, except 
it could be more efficien and they should be able to get a big time job 
helping it to be that way, if those dumb guys only understood!

Both Nader, a consumer advocate, a militant decorator of imperialism 
desiring to paint its toe nails so it looks civilised, and The Greens, petty 
bourgeois largely white suburban political drop-outs. No longer with even 
the political relevance of the anti war movement, but those upgraded "flower 
children" of the 60's communes who now can sell us tea or hip soap or 
chaming ice cream, or become respectable professionals, (stale Yippies in 
suits) whose main gripe is WHAT? The Environment. Like the NJ Green 
Senatorial Candidate, Bruce Afran, who says he "would be proud" to 
contribute to rich Democrat Jon Corzine's defeat. (Even though Corzine's 
platform is more progressive and more relevant to the working class and 
oppressed nationalities.) This Greens Man's main platform plank: "SAVE THE 
WETLANDS!"

This performance by Nader and the Greens shd effectively identify them as, 
objectively, the right wing of the rural petty bourgeois. Those not involved 
with saving Animals, rush to save the wetlands. While the plight of the 
working class, entrenched now perilously in the cities, they undermine and 
oppose, with ingenuous rhetoric and self-glorification as "independent 
progressives". Both lies.

It is to be noted that this sector of the rightist liberal petty bourgeois 
suburban yuppies and buppies are the pioneer settler group the Bigs are 
sending into the urban centers, like Newark, Harlem to reclaim for their 
young middle management hopefuls.

In fact, in the same NYTimes article quoted above, we find out that even 
though Nader criticixed Gore for hving stodk in the huge Occidental Oil 
Corp,  NADER TOO, HOLDS STOCK IN OCCIDENTAL. He sanitizes this by saying, 
"The key is whether you fight the company you have money in".

Bush is even buying ads for Nader to defeat Gore. But where are the Black 
issues or working class issues in detail in Nader's campaign? Aside from the 
wooden Indian lady he says is his running mate (has anybody seen her?) what 
aspects of Nader's campaign have addressed the issues of the working class, 
farmers or oppressed nationalities?

Are the Maxine Waters, Donald Paynes, John Conyers, .....&amp;c Congressional 
Black Caucus (as undependable as they are) to be undermined, particularly 
those holding or scheduled to become Chairpersons of mahor Congressional 
committees to support an aging Yippie? Nader and The Greens must be held 
responsible, along with the irresponsible, opportunists, or ignorant social 
democrats, as well as the various sub rational Trots, Anarchists deviants, 
and newly costume black supermilitants frenziedly pimping attention, if the 
oil savage Bush 2, get in.

IN EFFECT, THE NADER GREENS ARE WAGING CLASS WARFARE AGAINST THE WORKING 
CLASS AND DEMOCRATIC MASSES. As such, they are allies of the far right! Just 
as the Trots were when they undermined the Spanish Republic by opposing the 
Popular Front with a traitorous rhetoric a "Anti-Stalinist" leaders of an 
fantasy "Proletariat Revolution", dismissing the actual political reality 
that the Spanish republic was facing fascism and must use the Popular Front 
even to maintain the hollow democracy of a Bourgeois Republic.

As backward as Clinton, &amp;c are, the right lurch of the used to be liberal 
democrats. They are the Border States, Tennessee and Arkansas. Gare and 
Lieberman, added to assure Jews they are with them even though they want to 
cool out the Middle East with some rosy settlement and redivision of 
profits. (Its My Money, yells oily Bush) ...Bush Cheney represent a backward 
still more backward step, at this point just before another mass upsurge can 
begin.

The fake boycottism of the NaderGreens, in any real practical form, should 
only be used when there is a mass political upsurge, the boycott meaning to 
prevent the reintroduction of a past reform as alternative to the upsurge. 
But at the low ebb of the movement, not to use what tools, such as electoral 
politics to reverse the retreat, is criminally irresponsible, the ignorance 
of a brainless mouth, or the evil self possessed immorality of a "Bad Seed".

Between A SERIAL KILLER AND A PROSTITUTE is how the presidential election 
can be shown in metaphor. So the genuine Left, because it has not yet 
created a viable Anti-Imperialist United Front and the electorally effective 
LEFT BLOC, Lenin spoke of ("March Seperately, Strike Together!") is 
bookended between the liquidationist Social Democrat based Nader Green 
suburban, petty bourgeois, white gangster rap and the battery run juvenile 
delinquent infantile leftism &amp; political swindling of the 
trot-anarchist-super-black minstrel militants. Just as it was after the 
defeat of the 1905 revolution in Russia. Gleeing Intellectuals, Ex anti 
imperialist petty bourgeois up-graded by bribes, disillusioned used to be 
militants reconfigured as Preachers, newly moderate teachers, costumed 
whores, traitors who are now negotiators for imperialism, various God 
Builders and nostalgic husks explaining why they are on the other side...now 
that they realize how the doo doo.
Woiks.

Against all this we say, once more, REVOLUTIONARIES UNITE WITH THE WORKERS 
OF ALL NATIONALITIES, FARMERS, OPPRESSED PEOPLES AND DEMOCRATIC MIDDLE 
FORCES, IN A UNITED FRONT AGAINST IMPERIALISM AND NATIONAL OPPRESSION.

UNITE THE MANY TO DEFEAT THE FEW!! And for those of us still claiming 
Marxism Leninism, Mao Tse Tsung Though, Let us unite around the 
revolutionary practice and theory of these great teachers and begin now more 
earnestly and scientifically to LEAD THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNTER ATTACK! 
TOWARD U.S. PEOPLES DEMOCRACY AND SOCIALISM!

THREE KINGS TO SHARE THEIR WISDOM AND CULTURAL GIFTS WITH

PAX AND HOSTOS AS PART OF THE 11TH ANNUAL CELEBRATION IN THE BRONX


PAX Theatre Community (PAX), in association with the Hostos Center for the

Arts &amp; Culture, will present its 11th Annual Three Kings Celebration &amp;

Cultural Exchange on Saturday, January 5, 2002 at the state-of-the-art

Hostos Center for the Arts &amp; Culture.  Now proclaimed the "official" event

of its kind in Bronx County, PAX's annual festivity takes as its

point-of-departure the traditional Puerto Rican elements of D�a de los Reyes

(the day of kings; Epiphany), and combines them with PAX's standing

philosophy of cross-cultural sharing and Latino identity reinforcement.


Each year, PAX brings together a host of performance groups and artists

whose missions are the preservation and presentation of their country's

cultural treasures in a unified forum to be shared by all.  The 2002 Three

Kings Cultural Exchange Concert (7:00-10:30 PM) will feature: Trio New York

(Puerto Rico), La Cura Band (Dominican Republic), Mariachi Bustamante

(M�xico), and Agua Clara (Bolivia/Per�). PAX Theatre Community is currently

spearheading a campaign to have January 6, (Epiphany) declared a legal

holiday in New York City.


The event will also feature an arts &amp; crafts fair and sale in the

facilities' atrium from 4 PM - 8 PM., that will showcase hand-made items

created by artisans from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Chile,

and Mexico.


"The hope of PAX Theatre Community is that the next Latino generation will

again discover their rich cultural traditions, while bringing a bit of the

old world here to both our pioneering abuelitos  (grandparents) and recent

immigrants," said Edwin Pag�n, PAX's executive director and the festival's

producer.  "We also believe that this kind of cultural exchange with our

Latin-American neighbors will continue to bring the Latino community closer

together by helping us better understand each other, and crossing over the

stereotypes and barriers that separate us. It also lets us present these

customs to a non-Latino audience in an un-diluted form from our own

perspective."


Adults $12; Students &amp; Seniors $8; Children 10 and under $5.  Two-for-one

admission with Bronx Council on the Arts' Bronx Cultural Card. Tickets are

currently on sale at Hostos' box office located at 450 Grand Concourse

(148th &amp; 149th Streets - The Bronx).  Additional information can be obtained

by calling Hostos' box office at 718-518-4455, or by going to

www.hostos.cuny.edu.



ABOUT THE THREE KINGS DAY CELEBRATION


Epiphany (Greek epiphaneia, "appearance"), feast celebrated on January 6 by

the Anglican, Eastern, and Roman Catholic churches. The feast originated,

and is still recognized in the Eastern Church, as the anniversary of the

baptism of Christ. In the Western churches, Epiphany commemorates

principally the revelation to the Gentiles of Jesus Christ as the Savior, as

portrayed by the coming of the Three Wise Men (Matthew 2:1-12). In both the

Eastern and Western churches the feast secondarily commemorates the marriage

at Cana (John 2:1-11), at which Christ performed his first miracle.

Epiphany, known to have been observed earlier than 194 AD, is older than

Christmas and has always been a festival of the highest rank. The eve of

Epiphany is called Twelfth Night, and the day itself is sometimes referred

to as Twelfth Day. In England, the sovereign commemorates the day by

offering gold, frankincense, and myrrh at the altar in the Chapel Royal, at

Saint James's Palace. In the Eastern church, at Epiphany, the holy water is

blessed, a ritual customarily taking place on Holy Saturday (the day before

Easter) in the Roman Catholic church.


ABOUT PAX THEATRE COMMUNITY


Mission:    PAX Theatre Community (PAX) is an arts and education

collaborative which produces and presents works that celebrate and promote

Latino(a) identity and voice the concerns of people in underserved New York

City communities through the performing, visual, literary and media arts.


PAX (Latin for peace) was formed in the summer of 1990 in the South Bronx in

order to establish a group of artists who could pool their creative

abilities in an effort to enhance the educational programs in the region --

a sort of "culturally" responsive minute(wo)men.


Since then, PAX has developed a series of theatrical workshops for both

adolescents and adults; the Latin-unification and cross-cultural initiative

Com�nUnidad (common-unity/community) under whose non-partisan banner this

campaign is running; Una Noche de Caf� Teatro , an evening of dinner theater

where emerging theater troupes can showcase their works-in-progress in a

night-long marathon session; and PAX Youth Ensemble (PYE), a youth

leadership  theater training program.  In 1997, PYE kicked-off their Young

Voices series, which brings together youth-at-risk from the South Bronx, El

Barrio, Washington Heights, and the Lower East Side to create

conscience-raising forums and presentations based on issues of relevant

concern to them and their peers. The Young Voices project received a

three-year grant from the Citizens Committee of New York through funding by

The Rockefeller Foundation due to its innovative approach of creating a

youth program that effectively uses theater to teach essential leadership

skills and self-sufficiency as a necessary part of the developmental

process.


PAX Theatre Community also produces the annual Three Kings Celebration &amp;

Cultural Exchange series in the Bronx, now heading into its 11th year of

observance.  In 1999, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer issued an

executive chamber citation proclaiming PAX's event the "official" festivity

of its kind in the county.

Press Release

Viequenses struggle every day for peace

According to the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques (CRDV) 
the struggle  continues here every day, with or without bombing or 
maneuvers.  At the Peace and Justice Camp (PJC), headquarters of the CRDV 
located in front of the entrance to the Navy�s bombing zone, not a day goes 
by without activity in favor of the demilitarization of this island 
municipality.  �There is a continuous process of communication between our 
committee and the many support groups in Puerto Rico, as well as in other 
countries,� said Nilda Medina, member of the CRDV and principal leader of 
the PJC.  �From this office we coordinate with other Vieques groups and 
those from the main island, and we maintain contact with groups and 
individuals in solidarity with the Vieques cause from all around the world,� 
said Medina.

Members of the Vieques committee met yesterday at the PJC with lawyer Flavio 
Cumpiano, representative of the CRDV in Washington, DC, and with Federico de 
Jes�s, a young Puerto Rican pro Vieques activist, also residing in the 
federal capital.  They discussed the current situation and the implications 
of September 11th, among other topics.  Cumpiano emphasized the importance 
of the campaign directed by the CRDV to send letters to President Bush, to 
petition for an executive order for the immediate and permanent cessation of 
bombing.  �Bush is the Commander and Chief and has the constitutional 
authority necessary to stop the bombing on Vieques�, Cumpiano said.

In November and December, the Committee carried out regular activities in 
Vieques neighborhoods, handing out literature about the damages caused to 
the environment and health by Navy exercises, and to promote the next round 
of civil disobedience actions. The committee has collected and sent to the 
White House,  at this point, more than 1500 signatures on the petition to 
Bush calling for an end to the bombing.

Spokespersons for the community organization also announced that, while they 
prepare for Navy maneuvers planned for the end of January, thousands of feet 
of the fence separating the civilian sector from the Navy�s restricted zone 
have been dismantled.

The following statements from Alvaro Luna Hernandez and Khalfani Malik
Khaldun were issued by the prisoners themselves as the American
Correctional Association's Winter conference in San Antonio, TX approaches.
The ACA is the prison industry's largest professional/trade association.
Organizers around the state are planning events in major cities around
Texas for the week of January 6, building to a convergence against prisons
the following weekend in San Antonio for the opening of the ACA conference.

For a new year of one, two, three, and many more Chiapas:
Solidarity Statement to Those Protesting the American Correctional
Association's Winter Conference

Texas prison officials boast of having one of the best, most
self-sufficient prison systems in the world -- facilities where prisoners
produce their food; raise chickens, swine and cattle; and maintain over 40
other prison industries, such as making clothing and garments, signs for
national highways, police bulletproof vests (the Hughes Unit, where I am
held captive, has a garment factory that produces such products for the
prison system and other free world agencies), canneries, soap, furniture
and the like. Of course, prisoners produce these goods without pay. Many
free world industries have thus moved inside prisons -- in effect, making
these places factories with fences, and America's private gulags.

Remember the "Easter Sunday" rebellion at Lucasville prison in Ohio on
April 11, 1993? Lucasville was an "accredited" prison under ACA guidelines.
The prisoner uprising was the end result of gross overcrowding, racist
practices against Muslim brothers, and other inhumanities against the
defenseless prisoner population. So much for ACA "accreditation."

The American Correctional Association designation is merely a facade, a
mask, to give national credibility to a prison system that continues to
trample over the human rights of its captive population. Despite federal
court decrees in favor of prisoners, the judiciary has its limits and will
never challenge the fundamental nature of prisons in a capitalist society.
Much like the armed, organized violence of the police, prison institutions
maintain brutal control over their subjects.

Despite many court-ordered "reform" victories we won in the celebrated
"Ruiz v. Estelle" (now "Ruiz v. Cockrell") decision in the areas of inmate
guards, overcrowding, staff brutality, access to the courts, medical care,
etc., those same problems continue to this very day.

For example, this unit, the Hughes Unit, is an "accredited" prison under
ACA guidelines. A walk through the main hall's corridors reveals the ACA
logo, no less. However, corruption, racism and brutality against prisoners
is widespread. I have been here close to a month and am already witnessing
such conditions.

Recently, an officer in charge of prisoner arts and crafts was terminated
after more than $3,000 in contract sales revenues came up missing. The
"investigation" is ongoing, but unless outside criminal prosecution is
initiated by the federal government, this internal probe is akin to the fox
being in charge of the chicken coop, charged with protecting the hens from
its own watering mouth and jaws. Prisoners continue to complain about their
stolen monies.

Staff assaults, described by Judge William Wayne Justice in his March 1,
1999 court order on the "Ruiz" case as indicative of a "culture of
violence," and evidence of ongoing use of excessive force against prisoners
is a fact of life at Hughes. The "Ruiz" case is pending a final decision
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on this issue, and
on two others: conditions in administrative segregation and failure of
prison officials to protect prisoners from harm. A final decision may be
rendered by early 2002.

On the issue of medical care, the ACA was successful in politicking its way
out of a continued finding by Judge Justice for unconstitutional medical
care for prisoners. The ACA used its national political muscle to convince
the federal judge that the medical care system in Texas prisons, though not
up to par, was not "deliberately indifferent" -- sufficient to make it
unconstitutional under Eighth Amendment standards. We, the prisoners, have
reached the conclusion that the judge's decision was a matter of political
convenience of a federal judiciary ready to hand over the prison system
back to the state of Texas, despite years of official resistance to changes
and claims that attorneys of prisoners (Donna Brorby and Company out of San
Francisco) failed to present to the judge the complete picture as it
existed. These conclusions I have reached are based on special
investigative reports on medical care in Texas prisons done in December
2001 by the Austin American Statesman newspaper. The newspaper found
shocking results of the many unreported deaths of Texas prisonersdue to
inadequate medical care. See 
http://www.statesman.com/specialreports/prisons.

I and others, like brother Mumia Abu-Jamal, are serious threats to the
hegemony of elitist rule and the "corrections industry." We humanize the
over one-and-a-half million prisoners warehoused in America, and we work
diligently to expose the racist brutality, torture and other human rights
abuses. This exposure slows down the state's profiteering over these human
warehouses and slave labor camps for the continued misery of poor working
folks, as well as slows the economic livelihood and enrichment of locals
and their political hacks who do their bidding every legislative session.
We expose the utter hypocrisy and fallacy. We expose the true nature of the
capitalist, corporate democracy -- a paradise for the rich ruling class and
a murderous hell for the poor, the voiceless and the oppressed.

In the occupied territories of Aztlan, the Southwest United States,
incarceration rates for Raza have increased. White judiciaries are sending
first-time offenders more frequently to prison, and the racial composition
is increasingly Raza. This is a political plot, much like electoral
gerrymandering, for maintaining oppressive rule, where the white electorate
feels threatened by Raza population growth. We must look at these national
trends more closely.

History has demonstrated that it will take a concerted effort by the
prisoners themselves on the inside and a movement on the outside to bring
about respect for the rule of law, and for human rights protections for
those of us on the inside. We, as prisoners, have no political clout or
other lobbying tools to see that we are treated in a humane manner, or to
win freedom for those of us who are innocent of political charges. For
this, we need you on the outside. Your efforts are important, and these
actions to expose the American Correctional Association and the prison
system are not only necessary, but just and righteous. Keep up the fight.

Unchecked Crimes Against the Confined:
An Open Statement in Support of All Protesters Against the Amerikan
Correctional Association's conference in Texas

For far too long, the blatant brutality and psychological warfare unleased
by prisoncrats in this country has gone unchecked -- from state and federal
prisons, to now special interests and privately owned prisons alike. These
prisons are administered by a host of monsters who regularly conceal the
viciousness behind the walls, as well as the victims, both male and female.

Like any conspirators, these officials collectively operate on a
three-pronged system -- see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. After
reading Ernesto Aguilar's "Abuse and Profiteering Put Accreditation Under
Scrutiny," my mind was refreshed by the desire to further support and
encourage all actions launched to expose human rights violations in Texas
and elsewhere. False state-sanctioned accreditations are handed out as
violations continue to be exposed.

After spending nearly 16 years throughout Indiana's penal colony and being
on the frontlines of exposing racism and brutality, i am completely
convinced that, without your determination to stand up against these
injustices, these prisoncrats would try to murder us and even cover up the
facts in an effort to get away with it.

The Texas plantation prison colony symbolizes the racism of old South
slavemasters who never cared who they hurt, raped or killed. All that
mattered was the profit margin. And today money is the fuel that churns the
Texas death machine.

Being confined to a prison cell after being framed myself for the murder of
a prison guard, then literally hanged with a 60-year sentence, i am unable
to be there to stand side-by-side with you all. But my spirit is with you.
My heart is with you in this fight to destroy the prison reality and expose
what we can.

Comrades, it is very important to establish correspondence with many of the
prisoners housed in these units, to maintain factual updates on these
facilities. This will strengthen our overall effort.

i send a clenched-fist salutation and an embrace of the power of the people
to comrades in Houston, Austin, Dallas and San Antonio, and to the families
supporting loved ones behind the iron curtain.

The truth must be exposed!

For a new year of one, two, three, and many more Chiapas:
Solidarity Statement to Those Protesting the American Correctional
Association's Winter Conference

Texas prison officials boast of having one of the best, most
self-sufficient prison systems in the world -- facilities where prisoners
produce their food; raise chickens, swine and cattle; and maintain over 40
other prison industries, such as making clothing and garments, signs for
national highways, police bulletproof vests (the Hughes Unit, where I am
held captive, has a garment factory that produces such products for the
prison system and other free world agencies), canneries, soap, furniture
and the like. Of course, prisoners produce these goods without pay. Many
free world industries have thus moved inside prisons -- in effect, making
these places factories with fences, and America's private gulags.

Remember the "Easter Sunday" rebellion at Lucasville prison in Ohio on
April 11, 1993? Lucasville was an "accredited" prison under ACA guidelines.
The prisoner uprising was the end result of gross overcrowding, racist
practices against Muslim brothers, and other inhumanities against the
defenseless prisoner population. So much for ACA "accreditation."

The American Correctional Association designation is merely a facade, a
mask, to give national credibility to a prison system that continues to
trample over the human rights of its captive population. Despite federal
court decrees in favor of prisoners, the judiciary has its limits and will
never challenge the fundamental nature of prisons in a capitalist society.
Much like the armed, organized violence of the police, prison institutions
maintain brutal control over their subjects.

Despite many court-ordered "reform" victories we won in the celebrated
"Ruiz v. Estelle" (now "Ruiz v. Cockrell") decision in the areas of inmate
guards, overcrowding, staff brutality, access to the courts, medical care,
etc., those same problems continue to this very day.

For example, this unit, the Hughes Unit, is an "accredited" prison under
ACA guidelines. A walk through the main hall's corridors reveals the ACA
logo, no less. However, corruption, racism and brutality against prisoners
is widespread. I have been here close to a month and am already witnessing
such conditions.

Recently, an officer in charge of prisoner arts and crafts was terminated
after more than $3,000 in contract sales revenues came up missing. The
"investigation" is ongoing, but unless outside criminal prosecution is
initiated by the federal government, this internal probe is akin to the fox
being in charge of the chicken coop, charged with protecting the hens from
its own watering mouth and jaws. Prisoners continue to complain about their
stolen monies.

Staff assaults, described by Judge William Wayne Justice in his March 1,
1999 court order on the "Ruiz" case as indicative of a "culture of
violence," and evidence of ongoing use of excessive force against prisoners
is a fact of life at Hughes. The "Ruiz" case is pending a final decision
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on this issue, and
on two others: conditions in administrative segregation and failure of
prison officials to protect prisoners from harm. A final decision may be
rendered by early 2002.

On the issue of medical care, the ACA was successful in politicking its way
out of a continued finding by Judge Justice for unconstitutional medical
care for prisoners. The ACA used its national political muscle to convince
the federal judge that the medical care system in Texas prisons, though not
up to par, was not "deliberately indifferent" -- sufficient to make it
unconstitutional under Eighth Amendment standards. We, the prisoners, have
reached the conclusion that the judge's decision was a matter of political
convenience of a federal judiciary ready to hand over the prison system
back to the state of Texas, despite years of official resistance to changes
and claims that attorneys of prisoners (Donna Brorby and Company out of San
Francisco) failed to present to the judge the complete picture as it
existed. These conclusions I have reached are based on special
investigative reports on medical care in Texas prisons done in December
2001 by the Austin American Statesman newspaper. The newspaper found
shocking results of the many unreported deaths of Texas prisonersdue to
inadequate medical care. See
http://www.statesman.com/specialreports/prisons.

I and others, like brother Mumia Abu-Jamal, are serious threats to the
hegemony of elitist rule and the "corrections industry." We humanize the
over one-and-a-half million prisoners warehoused in America, and we work
diligently to expose the racist brutality, torture and other human rights
abuses. This exposure slows down the state's profiteering over these human
warehouses and slave labor camps for the continued misery of poor working
folks, as well as slows the economic livelihood and enrichment of locals
and their political hacks who do their bidding every legislative session.
We expose the utter hypocrisy and fallacy. We expose the true nature of the
capitalist, corporate democracy -- a paradise for the rich ruling class and
a murderous hell for the poor, the voiceless and the oppressed.

In the occupied territories of Aztlan, the Southwest United States,
incarceration rates for Raza have increased. White judiciaries are sending
first-time offenders more frequently to prison, and the racial composition
is increasingly Raza. This is a political plot, much like electoral
gerrymandering, for maintaining oppressive rule, where the white electorate
feels threatened by Raza population growth. We must look at these national
trends more closely.

History has demonstrated that it will take a concerted effort by the
prisoners themselves on the inside and a movement on the outside to bring
about respect for the rule of law, and for human rights protections for
those of us on the inside. We, as prisoners, have no political clout or
other lobbying tools to see that we are treated in a humane manner, or to
win freedom for those of us who are innocent of political charges. For

HOW MANY PRISONERS DESERVE THEIR PUNISHMENT? 90% NEVER RECEIVED A TRAIL.
45% OF DEATH PENALTIES ARE REVERSED - OFTEN AFTER DECADES OF
IMPRISONMENT. NEARLY ALL PRISONERS LIVED IN POVERTY PRIOR TO
INCARCERATION. PRISONS OFFER NO PATH TOWARD EARNING A BETTER LIVING
LAWFULLY. IT'S A CRIME TO BE POOR IN AMERICA. WE NEED JOBS AT LIVING

 &gt; hegemony of elitist rule and the "corrections industry." We humanize the
 &gt; over one-and-a-half million prisoners warehoused in America, and we work
 &gt; diligently to expose the racist brutality, torture and other human rights
 &gt; abuses. This exposure slows down the state's profiteering over these 
human
 &gt; warehouses and slave labor camps for the continued misery of poor working
 &gt; folks, as well as slows the economic livelihood and enrichment of locals
 &gt; and their political hacks who do their bidding every legislative session.
 &gt; We expose the utter hypocrisy and fallacy. We expose the true nature of
the
 &gt; capitalist, corporate democracy -- a paradise for the rich ruling class
and
 &gt; a murderous hell for the poor, the voiceless and the oppressed.
 &gt;
 &gt; In the occupied territories of Aztlan, the Southwest United States,
 &gt; incarceration rates for Raza have increased. White judiciaries are 
sending
 &gt; first-time offenders more frequently to prison, and the racial 
composition
 &gt; is increasingly Raza. This is a political plot, much like electoral
 &gt; gerrymandering, for maintaining oppressive rule, where the white
electorate
 &gt; feels threatened by Raza population growth. We must look at these 
national
 &gt; trends more closely.
 &gt;
 &gt; History has demonstrated that it will take a concerted effort by the
 &gt; prisoners themselves on the inside and a movement on the outside to bring
 &gt; about respect for the rule of law, and for human rights protections for
 &gt; those of us on the inside. We, as prisoners, have no political clout or
 &gt; other lobbying tools to see that we are treated in a humane manner, or to
 &gt; win freedom for those of us who are innocent of political charges. For
 &gt; this, we need you on the outside. Your efforts are important, and these
 &gt; actions to expose the American Correctional Association and the prison
 &gt; system are not only necessary, but just and righteous. Keep up the fight.

 &gt;
 &gt; Unchecked Crimes Against the Confined:
 &gt; An Open Statement in Support of All Protesters Against the Amerikan
 &gt; Correctional Association's conference in Texas
 &gt;
 &gt; For far too long, the blatant brutality and psychological warfare 
unleased
 &gt; by prisoncrats in this country has gone unchecked -- from state and
federal
 &gt; prisons, to now special interests and privately owned prisons alike. 
These
 &gt; prisons are administered by a host of monsters who regularly conceal the
 &gt; viciousness behind the walls, as well as the victims, both male and
female.
 &gt;
 &gt; Like any conspirators, these officials collectively operate on a
 &gt; three-pronged system -- see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. After
 &gt; reading Ernesto Aguilar's "Abuse and Profiteering Put Accreditation Under
 &gt; Scrutiny," my mind was refreshed by the desire to further support and
 &gt; encourage all actions launched to expose human rights violations in Texas
 &gt; and elsewhere. False state-sanctioned accreditations are handed out as
 &gt; violations continue to be exposed.
 &gt;
 &gt; After spending nearly 16 years throughout Indiana's penal colony and 
being
 &gt; on the frontlines of exposing racism and brutality, i am completely
 &gt; convinced that, without your determination to stand up against these
 &gt; injustices, these prisoncrats would try to murder us and even cover up 
the
 &gt; facts in an effort to get away with it.
 &gt;
 &gt; The Texas plantation prison colony symbolizes the racism of old South
 &gt; slavemasters who never cared who they hurt, raped or killed. All that
 &gt; mattered was the profit margin. And today money is the fuel that churns
the
 &gt; Texas death machine.
 &gt;
 &gt; Being confined to a prison cell after being framed myself for the murder
of
 &gt; a prison guard, then literally hanged with a 60-year sentence, i am 
unable
 &gt; to be there to stand side-by-side with you all. But my spirit is with 
you.
 &gt; My heart is with you in this fight to destroy the prison reality and
expose
 &gt; what we can.
 &gt;
 &gt; Comrades, it is very important to establish correspondence with many of
the
 &gt; prisoners housed in these units, to maintain factual updates on these
 &gt; facilities. This will strengthen our overall effort.
 &gt;
 &gt; i send a clenched-fist salutation and an embrace of the power of the
people
 &gt; to comrades in Houston, Austin, Dallas and San Antonio, and to the
families
 &gt; supporting loved ones behind the iron curtain.
 &gt;
 &gt; The truth must be exposed!

<pre>                     Booker enters ring with James

                     01/09/02

                     BY NIKITA STEWART
                     STAR-LEDGER STAFF

                     Calling for a "renaissance for the rest of us," Newark 
Central Ward Councilman Cory Booker announced his challenge to longtime 
Mayor Sharpe James yesterday at an outdoor rally.

                     His voice quavering from the bitter cold, Booker, 32, 
outlined his assessment of Newark's social ills -- from its ranking as one 
of the worst places to raise children to its murder rate.

                     "There's so much work to be done," he said. "Some of 
our leaders say we need no change. If there is a renaissance in Newark, then 
it's time for a renaissance for the rest of us."

                     The phrase, repeated often in his speech, drew cheers 
from a crowd that endured the chill to watch Booker speak from a stage in a 
parking lot on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

                     Television crews and magazine and newspaper reporters 
surrounded the stage yesterday to cover the start of a campaign that may be 
the city's most-watched since 1970, whenNewark elected its first black 
mayor, Kenneth Gibson.

                     James declared his candidacy for a record fifth term at 
his 65th birthday party and campaign fund-raiser last February. But 
yesterday the mayor had little to say about Booker or the May 14 nonpartisan 
election.

                     "I'm busy being mayor," James said. "I'm not 
politicking. I'm running the city of Newark at a crisis time in America 
where we have a budget problem, where we have a health problem, where we 
have a threat to our national and local security."

                     At yesterday's rally, Booker pointed to the city's 
health problems, poverty and unemployment rates and criticized James' 
combined $171,000 salary as mayor and state senator. "While residents are 
looking for jobs, Sharpe James has two," he said.

                     Some onlookers were distracted by the outbursts of 
Dwayne Smith, a mayoral candidate running under the banner of "New Newark 
Social Order." Wielding an oversized, orange plastic baseball bat, Smith 
promised to challenge both Booker and James. "I ain't singing. I'm swinging. 
Cory Booker who?" he asked.

                     But nationally, Booker is known.

                     The Newark election will follow a national trend of 
young, well-educated upstarts taking on longtime politicians to head major 
cities, said Al From, founder and chief executive of the Democratic 
Leadership Council, a national organization of moderate Democrats.

                     "In city after city, there are new mayors coming to the 
forefront to replace the old guard," From said, referring to Baltimore, 
Indianapolis, Detroit and Columbus, Ohio. "Cory is in the context of the 
young reform politicians."

                     Booker was a Rhodes Scholar who went to Stanford 
University on a football scholarship in 1987. James won his first election 
in 1970.

                     Newark politics, however, has often been immune to 
national trends.

                     "Newark may be an anomaly," From said. "Everybody tells 
me this is going to be a tight race."

                     It's not just about the old guard versus the new guard. 
James is the city's quintessential Newarker -- born in the South but raised 
with northern street-smarts and sensibilities. And he is the king of the 
city's political machine, never losing a race.

                     Booker is an outsider, growing up in Bergen County's 
Harrington Park and moving to Newark only in 1996. And he is an independent, 
narrowly winning his council seat in 1998.

                     The city's unofficial slogan -- "Brick City. We play 
tough here"-- is emblazoned on T-shirts sold by street vendors.

                     The slogan applies to politics as well.

                     In July, Booker and James ran into each other on an 
East Ward street, and the councilman tried to hug the mayor. James said he 
raised an elbow to fend off the hug, but witnesses said he pushed Booker.

                     Gibson, ousted by James in 1986, predicted a fierce 
fight months ago: "This election will probably be one of the most heated."

                     To compete with James' $1.7 million war chest of 
employee and Newark business contributions, Booker has raised money all over 
the country. He has collected $628,000 in contributions, including money 
from his former classmates at Stanford University, Oxford University and 
Yale Law School.

                     His detractors are already making an issue of the 
contributions since Booker proposed campaign finance reform legislation last 
month. Critics have mailed hundreds of anonymous letters throughout the city 
and state, questioning why a reformer would accept so many contributions.

                     In an earlier interview about the letters, Booker said 
his proposed reform is about preventing people who do business with the city 
from influencing city contracts with campaign funds. He said his stance 
might hurt him in future campaigns.

                     But for now, he'll take the money. "Sharpe James is not 
the only million-dollar man in town," Booker said.

                     James' unsuccessful opponents in past elections have 
never had the kind of money required to compete against him.

                     Political observers say it takes more than money to 
beat James.

                     "He's a very skillful politician," said James Garner, 
mayor of Hempstead, N.Y., and chairman of the advisory board of the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors.

                     James has overseen the city's development, helping to 
bring the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, a minor league baseball stadium 
and -- potentially -- a sports complex for the New Jersey Nets and Devils to 
Newark.

                     New housing has popped up around the city, crime has 
decreased significantly and businesses such as IDT and MBNA are relocating 
to the state's largest city.

                     Booker attacked those accomplishments yesterday as 
catering to the downtown while neighborhoods suffer higher crime rates and 
get fewer services.

                     He also unveiled three members of his slate: Ronald 
Rice Jr., son of state Sen. Ronald Rice (D-Essex), for council at-large; 
Marjory Avant, an attorney and financial analyst, for at-large; and Dana 
Rone, president of the advisory school board, for the Central Ward seat.

                     James' slogan this year is "Experienced Leadership . . 
. Let's Continue the Progress."

                     As Booker listed the city's problems yesterday, he 
turned the mayor's slogan around and said, "This is not progress."

iPNB agrees to fire Daughtry, rehire WBAI fired &amp; banned; names Coughlin 
acting ED
January 13, 2002: With an invincible, better-than-two-thirds majority, and 
backed by a supportive audience of more than 500 listeners and activists, 
the reformers on the interim Pacifica National Board made a clean sweep of 
many of the serious issues affecting the network at its three-day meeting in 
New York.

Working methodically through a long agenda, the board:

o Adopted a committee report calling for the firing of WBAI general manager 
Bob Daughtry and the return of those fired and banned by the station since 
the Dec. 22, 2000 "Christmas coup." Daughtry will be replaced by Valerie Van 
Isler, who was removed as WBAI manager after the coup and fired when she 
resisted a transfer to Pacifica headquarters.

o Agreed to hire former Pacifica Network News Director Dan Coughlin, who was 
fired after allowing news of a nationwide affiliate boycott of Pacifica on 
the air and has been working with the Pacifica Campaign to unseat the 
previous board, as interim Executive Director.  Coughlin will serve until a 
permanent ED is chosen, a process that may take 60 days.

o Told the warring Houston Local Advisory Boards to merge and get into 
compliance with  Pacifica's bylaws.

o Agreed to fire the law firms of Williams and Connolly and Fulbright and 
Jaworski, which had been hired by the old board to fight the listener, LAB, 
and intraboard lawsuits.

The meeting was held Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday at the New York 
Hotel Trade Council headquarters in mid-Manhattan and was packed with 
interested listeners at every session.  Although rowdy, frequently 
applauding and hooting, the audience did not disrupt the completion of the 
long agenda.  They were given opportunities to speak to the board at several 
sessions scheduled throughout the meeting.

The new majority was assured of a free hand when only three representatives 
of the old majority showed up at the meeting. Wendell Johns resigned by fax 
before the meeting and Dick Gregory did not appear, leaving Marion Berry, 
Bert Lee and James Ferguson to carry the opposition.  It wasn't enough, 
since the nine former dissidents could always manage a two-thirds majority 
-- a requirement under the settlement of the lawsuits.

Berry suggested that the decisions might be challenged in court, a course 
that board member Carol Spooner, who sponsored the long listener lawsuit, 
invited him to take.  Berry presumably will not have access to the old 
Pacifica board law firms.

A previous attempt to fire the firms did not obtain a two-thirds majority 
and was rejected by Judge Ronald Sabraw, to whom it was referred.  The new 
ballot was taken after Spooner reported that all parties had signed off on 
the lawsuit settlement, including the judge; and that therefore there was no 
reason for the law firms to be retained.

The board did not agree, however, to move Pacifica headquarters back from 
Washington to Berkeley, even though Friends of Free Speech Radio offered a 
grant to cover relocation expenses. That motion failed, to the surprise of 
many long-time activists, who pointed out that the Foundation had been 
founded in Berkeley and resided there for 50 years. It had been moved in the 
dead of night by the former board majority and spirited away to Washington 
DC in an effort to escape from Bay Area listeners' protests. The board did 
agree to study the matter and consider it again later.

The board also heard reports from station managers Jim Bennett (KPFA), Mark 
Schubb (KPFK), Lew Hankins (WPFW), and Daughtry (WBAI).  Garland Ganter, the 
GM of KPFT (Houston) has resigned and no successor had been named to 
represent the station.

Schubb was strongly critical of the national board and complained that 
Pacifica was interfering with local programming while refusing to pay local 
bills.  KPFK, he said, has been broadcasting under reduced power because it 
cannot afford to replace its transmitter.

Each LAB also reported to the board; and Dave Adelson, representing the Los 
Angeles LAB, challenged Schubb�s report and said that KPFK was broadcasting 
a cart that falsely aligns the malpractice of the old PNB with the new iPNB.

Similarly, Sam Husseini, head of the WPFW LAB, challenged Hankins' report 
and called for the new board to fire him.

As executive secretary, Coughlin will have the power to hire and fire, a 
point that was specifically authorized by the board when it defeated Barry's 
motion to prevent firings without board approval.

However the firing of Daughtry was specifically ordered by the board in 
accepting the report of the special committee formed to investigate the WBAI 
management.  That committee recommended:

o Immediate removal of Daughtry.
o Immediate return of the fired of banned (since 12-22-00)
o Lifting all banning orders
o Requiring committee approval for hiring and firing at the station.
o Seeking a union solution that includes unpaid staff. Until then the last 
union agreement will be followed.
o Holding LAB meetings at the station.
o Working with the executive director to carry out the recommendations.

Defeating a move by Barry, the board agreed to accept the report in its 
entirety.
The issue of the PNN stringers' strike, originally on the agenda for Sunday, 
was tabled due to lack of time, but that several listeners and board members 
spoke of their strong commitment to return the striking stringers and their 
newscast, Free Speech Radio News, to Pacifica. The PNN strikers distributed 
a written statement to the board and audience.

The board also noted an announcement from Jim Bennett that Larry Bensky, 
fired from his position of National Affairs Correspondent by Lynn Chadwick, 
who has been working as a volunteer since KPFA got control of its airwaves, 
would be put on KPFA's paid staff.
The board voted to meet next in Los Angeles, from March 8-10.

<pre>New Brunswick plan raises ethical concerns 

01/13/02

BY ALEXANDER LANE
STAR-LEDGER STAFF

The New Brunswick council is scheduled to vote this
week on whether to designate a blighted site at French
and Somerset streets -- owned by several prominent
city insiders -- as a "redevelopment area," a move
likely to drive up the property's value. 


It also has raised some eyebrows and ethical
questions. 


A partnership that includes Christopher Paladino,
George Zoffinger, Thomas Schrum and John Sisti owns
the triangular site near New Brunswick's border with
Franklin. 


Paladino is president of the New Brunswick Development
Corporation, or Devco, a nonprofit that engineers many
city redevelopment deals. Zoffinger is the chairman of
the corporation's board. 


Thomas Schrum is the brother of city Councilman Joseph
Schrum, who until last April had also been a partner.
He dropped out because of concerns that an ethical
conflict might emerge, he said. The men bought the
property for $450,000 in mid-September of 2000. 


A developer acting on behalf of the Magyar Savings
Bank, a downtown bank, has expressed interest in
buying the land from the partners for $990,000, so the
bank can move there. 


Magyar President Robert Pastor said the redevelopment
designation would make the site more attractive to the
bank. The designation would allow the bank to seek a
tax break and more easily bypass zoning restrictions,
among other benefits. 


With money fronted by Zoffinger, the partnership,
called Somerset Street Associates LLC, also spent
about $250,000 cleaning up environmental problems and
paying other expenses, Zoffinger said. 


Zoffinger, a banker, is the president and CEO of the
Constellation Capital Corp. He was state commerce
commissioner under Gov. Jim Florio, and is Gov-elect
James E. McGreevey's point man in working to save
union jobs at the Ford Motor Co. plant in Edison. 


In the last 25 years Devco has, by most accounts, done
an impressive job revitalizing New Brunswick with
large-scale downtown redevelopment projects. 


However, the agency has been criticized for not doing
much to improve outlying city neighborhoods, like the
one near Somerset and French streets. Critics also say
Devco's ability to operate out of public view leads to
mistrust of the corporation. 


One activist says that the fact that Zoffinger,
Paladino and the Schrums are doing real estate deals
together confirms their worst fears. 


"I think it's despicable," said Judy Mason. "I am of
the opinion that Zoffinger, along with other Devco
people and the city politicians, have the inside
information, and they're trying to profit from it." 


"Devco keeps their dealing and their finances and
everything they do very private," Mason continued.
"It's the city's way of keeping the public locked out
of the information we should have access to." 


The Schrums, Paladino and Sisti put up virtually no
money to get in on the deal. However, they all shared
the debt, the partners said. Zoffinger said he made
the partnership with the Schrums because Thomas Schrum
suggested the deal and managed the property. Joseph
Schrum, the councilman, said he shared those duties
with his brother until he backed out of the
partnership. 


Under the deal, Zoffinger and Paladino, as a pair,
would split the profits from the sale of the site
50-50 with Sisti and the two Schrums. 


Paladino and Zoffinger said they never asked for the
city to designate the property a redevelopment area,
and they do not think it would necessarily raise their
property's value. 


"I'll give you my word, I didn't know they were doing
this," Zoffinger said, referring to the city council's
action. "And secondly, I don't even care." 


Paladino and Zoffinger, who live in Montgomery and
have done real estate deals in and outside of Devco
for years, said there was nothing wrong with their
buying and selling real estate in New Brunswick as
long as they do not use inside information. 


However, the two men said that due to the public
perception that their private deals could be
unethical, they would sell all of their property in
the city and not buy any more as long as they worked
for Devco. 


"It's not good from a public relations standpoint, so
we won't do it," Paladino said. "Live and learn." 


Several business ethics experts said there was not
necessarily an ethical problem with Zoffinger and
Paladino making real estate transactions in New
Brunswick. 


"Their involvement with Devco shouldn't automatically
preclude their doing business in New Brunswick," said
Ed Hartman, a Rutgers University business ethics
professor. 


However, Hartman and other experts said the Devco
board should develop an ethics policy. The
organization has no such policy now. 


As part of an ethics policy, Devco's board should
disclose to the public any deals they or members of
their staff are privately conducting in New Brunswick,
several experts said. 


"The best thing to do is face these potential
conflicts of interest and try to deal with them head
on," said W. Michael Hoffman, director of the Center
for Business Ethics at Bentley College in
Massachusetts. "They should be absolutely transparent
about them to their constituency, and set up some
protocols as to how they plan to proceed to avoid any
kind of inappropriate or debilitating conflict of
interest." 


Zoffinger and Paladino said they twice told Devco's
board about the deal. Board members said the pair did
not appear to have inside information, and their deal
did not conflict with any Devco transactions. 


After the purchase of the property was made public,
Zoffinger directed the Devco staff to research ethics
policies for its board to consider, Paladino said.
When contacted, several board members showed little
interest in an ethics policy. 


"People have a right to invest their money how they
want to," said board member Alvin Rockoff, retired
president of a Woodbridge investment firm and former
chairman of the Rutgers Board of Governors. "If
someone wants to be a moralist let them go to church."



Rockoff said he owned no property in New Brunswick. 


Board member Aldrage Cooper, retired vice president of
corporate affairs at Johnson &amp; Johnson, was equally
uninterested in Paladino and Zoffinger's deal or in an
ethics policy. "I have no concern. I've got more
important things on my mind," Cooper said. 


Board member Vito Nardelli, a senior vice president at
First Union Bank, did not return calls on the matter.
Board Vice Chair Robert Gamgort, vice president of
real estate for Johnson &amp; Johnson, would not comment.
Nor would board member David Harris, executive
director of the Mae J. Strong Child Development Center
in New Brunswick. 


The only board member who endorsed an ethics policy
was Ira Novak, a partner at the Somerville law firm
Norris, McLaughlin &amp; Marcus and the general counsel
for Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New
Brunswick. 


"Of course it's a good idea," Novak said. "How could
it not be a good idea?"

MALCOLM X COMMEMORATION COMMITTEE PAYS TRIBUTE TO FAMILIES OF POLITICAL 
PRISONERS

7th Annual Dinner To Be Held at Restoration Plaza In Bed-Stuy Brooklyn
On January 20th

The Malcolm X Commemoration Committee is hosting its 7th annual dinner for 
the families of New Afrikan political prisoners and prisoners of war on 
January 20th at Restoration Plaza, 1368 Fulton Street (near New York Avenue) 
from 3p.m. to 8p.m.

The theme of this year's dinner will be  "Against All Odds: Resisting State 
Terrorism And Repression By Any Means Necessary!" This year's special guest 
speaker will be longtime activist and elder of the Black Liberation 
Movement, Brother Ed Brown, the older brother of Imam Jamil Abdullah 
Al-Amin, formerly known as H.Rap Brown, who is about to go on trial for his 
life in Atlanta, Georgia. Other presenters will include fire-spitting Black 
Liberation theologist Father Lawrence Lucas, and veteran people's poet and 
publisher, Louis Reyes Rivera of Shamel Books.

Other cultural events and the usual well-prepared dinner will be part of the 
activities. "We are again inviting our elected  Black officials to join us 
in this community-supported tribute and we are expecting all the recently 
elected new City Council members to be there to meet the families and to 
show their support for our struggle to free our pp/pows which is one of our 
central demands for Reparations." stated Jean Reynolds in a no-nonsense 
voice.
Jean is a founding member of the MXCC and a founding member of Malcolm
X's Muslim Mosque, Inc., and his Organization of Afro-American Unity.

Speakers this year have been chosen for their long involvement in the 
campaign to free political prisoners and their resolute concern about the 
parents and siblings of our heroic freedom fighters who have languished in 
dreary prison cells serving sentences that in many instances exceed three 
decades. "We are fortunate to have two speakers of the caliber of Father 
Lawrence Lucas and Brother Ed Brown for this year's program," exclaimed an 
obviously excited Terry Adams, who is heading the committee that is in 
charge of the event. "Father Lucas is the Catholic priest who serves as the 
chaplain at Riker's Island jail and he knows from the inside the pressures 
and problems that our brothers and sisters behind the wall have to put up 
with. He also knows first-hand about the terrible problems their relatives 
face everyday in trying to cope with the absence of their fathers, brothers, 
uncles, aunts, sisters and grandparents, who if we really look at it are 
also serving time out here," she ontinued. "It is important to drive home to 
the public that just as we have always done in the past, the proceeds of 
this moving evening of analysis, organization and people's culture will go 
into the commissary accounts of the political prisoners and prisoners of 
war, whose families live in the greater New York City area", explained 
Herman Ferguson, an elder in the movement and who is Chairman of the MXCC, 
"to provide them with necessities like soap, toothpaste, vitamins, 
toothbrushes, stamps, stationery, etc., that are not provided by the State 
Department of Correction," he lamented.
MXCC Press Officer Zayid Muhammad added, "We are going to place emphasis on 
the political prisoners who were put in solitary confinement following the 
World Trade Center bombing like Sundiata Acoli (who is still under severe 
restrictions), to the upcoming trial of Imam Al-Amin and, of course, to the 
latest developments in the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal.

The implications of the Homeland Security measures announced recently by the 
Bush
administration, the passage of the Patriotic Act of 2001, and how these acts 
will bring more grief and suffering to the Black community will be analyzed 
and explained by the speakers." Tickets for this event are $35 and will be 
available at the door. Or call:718-949-5153 for information or reservations

NEW BRUNSWICK: 2 charged in ed board fracas

               Published in the Home News Tribune 1/17/02

               By SHARON WATERS
               STAFF WRITER

               Misdemeanor charges have been filed against city activists 
Joe Smith and Cliff Smith for their confrontation with officials at Tuesday 
night's Board of Education meeting at New Brunswick High School.

               Joe Smith was charged with disrupting a lawful meeting and 
two counts of simple assault -- one for contact with high school Principal 
Pierre Embrey and the other for contact with Donald Bowling, chief of 
police-community relations, said police Lt. Thomas Selesky.  According to 
Bowling he was bit by Joe Smith who also allegedly scratched Embrey's neck.

               Cliff Smith was charged with disorderly conduct, Selesky 
said.

               At the meeting, the Smiths were distributing a flier stating 
the percentage of city students who passed standardized tests. Embrey asked 
the Smiths to leave, but the pair refused. As Bowling and two security-staff 
members held Joe Smith with Embrey nearby, a scuffle ensued during which 
Bowling was bit and Embrey scratched, according to Bowling.

               Joe Smith released a statement saying he and Cliff Smith were 
treated at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and released. The Smiths 
plan to file assault charges against Embrey and the school security guards, 
the statement said.

               The Smiths said their arrests were an attempt to distract 
attention from the standardized-test scores, according to the statement.

               Two brothers arrested in school ruckus

               Published in the Home News Tribune 1/16/02

               By SHARON WATERS
               STAFF WRITER

               NEW BRUNSWICK: City activists Joe Smith and Cliff Smith were 
arrested after a confrontation with officials at last night's
Board of Education meeting.

               The brothers were distributing literature while the board was 
in closed session and were asked to leave by Principal Pierre Embrey, 
according to Donald Bowling, chief of police community relations.

               Cliff Smith refused to leave and "jumped" on Embrey, Bowling 
said. After high school security staff removed Cliff Smith, Joe Smith also 
refused to leave the building, said Bowling.

               Bowling and two security staff held Joe Smith with Embrey 
nearby and a scuffle ensued in which the activist fell to the ground and 
Bowling said he was bit by Joe Smith, who also scratched Embrey's neck.

               Joe Smith's phone was taken when it fell to the ground, 
Bowling said, and was turned over to police. The high school has received 
bomb threats and Joe Smith is a suspect, Bowling said.

               It was not known last night what charges were filed against 
the Smith brothers. As he was led away, Joe Smith said he wanted to file his 
own charges.

               Last month, Cliff Smith was found not guilty for a September 
2000 incident with Embrey. The principal, who declined to testify at trial, 
had charged that Cliff Smith assaulted and verbally abused him while the 
activist distributed literature at the high school.

Why's/Wise is a long poem in the tradition of the Djali(Griots) but this 
about African American (American) History.  It is also
like Tolson's "Liberia", WCW's "Paterson", Hughes' "Ask Yr Mama", Olson's 
"Maximus" in that it tries to tell the history/life
like an ongoing-offcoming Tale.

What vision

"I am not a king or queen," your own hand
if you bee of the royal catch
or the tribes soulwarped by the ghoulishness

I still hear those songs and cries
of the sons and sons and daughters and daughters
I still bear that weeping in my heart
that bleeding in my memory

And I am not a king
nor trader in flesh
I was
of the sufferers
I am among those
to be avenged!

No coat has I got
no extra chop
no soft bed or favor
no connection with the slaver

dark was the night
our eyes had not met
I fastened my life to me
and tried to find my way

talk did I hear
of fires and burning
and death to the gods

on the dirt where I slept
such talk
warmed me

such talk
lit my way

I has never got nothing but hard times and punishment
Any joy I had I made myself, and the dark woman
who took my hand and led me to myself

I has never got nothing
but a head full of blood
my scar, my missing teeth.

I has never got nothing but
killer frustration/ yes dark
was the night
cold was the ground

I has never got nothing, and talk
of rebellion
warmed me

Song to me, was the darkness
in which I could stand
my profile melted into the black air
red from the flame of the burning big house.

in those crazy dreams I called myself
Coltrane
bathed in a black and red fire
in those crazy moments I called myself
Thelonius
&amp; this was in the 19th century!



				Wise 5
						("Breaks")
						 Baby Dodds

I overheard the other night
standing by the window
of the big house

a nigra say, through an alabaster
mask, "the first negro
was a white man."

slanty red darts angulate the darkness
my hands got cold, my head was sweaty

like a mystery
story
like a gospel
hymn
like the tales of the wizards
and the life of the gods

I did not know
who my father
was

I only barely
knew
my mother

But I knew something that night
about a negro
something even
the tv cant wash
away

I fount out something
about the negro

the wind may blow
the train don't dome
the mayor might belch
his mistress might gain weight

but I fount out something that night
about the Negro
&amp; the world
got clear

you can hurray all you want to
you can kiss an elephant's ass

but I fount something
that night, before I slid
back to the field hands' quarters
I fount out something
about
the magic
of slavery

&amp; I vowed not to be
a slave
no more.

Press Release

Viequenses denounce sentences for Zenon�s as abusive

The Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques (CRDV) denounced as 
excessive, abusive and violent, the six month sentences given yesterday to 
anti-military activists Carlos Zen�n and his son, Yabureibo.  Spokespersons 
for the Vieques organization suggested the sentence is part of a military 
strategy developed at the Navy base of Roosevelt Roads, in the town of 
Ceiba, Puerto Rico.  �We have no doubt that Admiral Green was consulted by 
Judge Fust� on this sentence,� said Nilda Medina, CRDV.  �The sentence can 
only be understood in the context of military plans to do away with the 
civil disobedience movement and thereby continue with their maneuvers in 
Vieques�, she concluded.

Members of the Committee affirmed their total support for the Zenon family, 
who have played a central role in the struggle during decades, and most 
particularly, after the death of  David Sanes in April of 1999, when they 
established the Monte David civil disobedience camp in the bombing zone.  
Yabureibo Zen�n, age eighteen, is part of the Vieques youth movement that 
has become very active in the struggle for peace here.  Carlos �Taso� Zen�n, 
has been active in the struggle against the Navy since the founding of the 
Vieques Fishermen�s Association at the end of the 1970�s.  In that period of 
the struggle, Zen�n and other fishermen blocked military maneuvers on 
several occasions, resulting in arrests and repression by federal marshalls, 
courts and jails.

The Committee urges people in solidarity to write to these most recent 
prisioners for peace on Vieques:

Carlos Zen�n                   # 23214-069

Two activists charged in fight at meeting

Star-Ledger, January 22, 2002

New Brunswick:  Two local political activists--brothers Cliff and Joseph 
Smith--are to appear in municipal court today to face charges related to a 
fight with officials at a school board meeting.

The Smiths tangled with New Brunswick High School Principal Pierre Embrey 
and New Brunswick police officer Donnie Bowling, chief of community 
relations for the department, when Embrey prohibited them from handing out 
fliers at last Tuesday's board of education meeting.

Cliff Smith, 32, allegedly refused to leave the meeting.  Joseph Smith, 25, 
allegedly punched Embrey and bit Bowling when they tried to carry Cliff 
Smith out.

Cliff Smith is charged with disrupting a public meeting.  Joseph Smith is 
charged with disrupting a public meeting and two counts of assault.

Cliff Smith said he filed charges of assault Friday against Embrey and 
Bowling, and he said his brother would file similar charges today.

The Smiths' pamphlets criticized the board for the low performance of city 
students on standardized tests.  The Smiths have long pressed for an elected 
school board in New Brunswick.  Currently, the mayor appoints the board.

Embrey charged Cliff Smith with assault for an altercation outside the high 
school during the 2000 campaign, but the charge was dropped after Embrey 
failed to show up in court.

assignment of resources to accomplish those strategies.  The team is 
expected to engage in a concensus-based decision-making process 
following the ground rules of group discussion.  The School 
Management Teams should consists of parents, community and teachers.

Come join the Black and Latino Education Summit members on Thursday-

3. How many community members are involved?

               Tuesday's letters to the Home News Tribune

               Published in the Home News Tribune 1/29/02


               Reparations a democratic ideal

               All democratic peoples should support reparations and 
self-determination for the oppressed black nation and the demand for such 
put out by those like letter writer Joseph Mosely (Jan. 16). The social 
inequality of black America, enforced by the industrialists' betrayal of the 
post-Civil War Reconstruction, belies any promise of "democracy" and 
progress for the masses of people.

               To deny this historic and current inequality gives shelter to 
the likes of the Enron thieves and their cohorts in the counterfeit Bush 
administration; allows education, jobs, health care, etc., to be denied to 
tens of millions of U.S. residents, and allows monopolies to run roughshod 
over any and all constitutional rights and human development.

               You see, if Amadou Diallo can be legally shot 41 times, a 
poor white worker can be shot 40 and still be also told he's a full citizen. 
Divided, we fall.

               Our multinational strength, against the anti-democratic 
monopolies, depends on our unity, which can only be established through 
active support for national equality via reparations and self-determination. 
Minimally, this must take the form of, for example, free education for all 
American blacks.

Defend New Brunswick's Youth!
New Brunswick's Campaign for the Elected Board of Education is calling for 
state-wide support for our efforts toward a victorious campaign this 
November. New Brunswick public schools, while having the only Mayoral 
Appointed board of education, are the worst educational institutions in 
Middlesex County.
Over the past two years this criminal board has accomplished only what the 
enemy of a proper education can accomplish! High School Proficiency, which 
is required for graduation, has dropped over 33%:
76.8% proficient 1999 - 51% proficient 2001. What would people in Highland 
Park, Edison, East Brunswick, Piscataway &amp;tc. do if this happened to their 
public schools? They would vote out the jokers on the BOE. And that is what 
we must do in New Brunswick! But first we must must organize &amp; Win the 
elected school board this November.
For the New Brunswick city machine to defend/support this oppressive mayoral 
appointed BOE shows that they support this attack on the youth of this city. 
And therefore they must be gotten rid of too! For it is the lack of a proper 
education which leads to &amp; is connected to every social problem throughout 
New Brunswick. Unemployment, Crime, Drugs, Gangs, and all other 
anti-productive social issues are a direct result of the lack of a proper 
education.
It is a terrible contradiction that New Brunswick is home to the most 
advanced institution of education throughout the state, Rutgers, but yet 
less than 50% of NB High School enrollers graduate.
Abott districts throughout New Jersey must organize and rise. We must fight 
the scientific segregation, we must defeat the crooks &amp; the crooked, our 
time to unite is now, because you can't survive a genocide alone. The most 
advanced democratic struggle exists in the question of how schools are to be 
organized and run. Just study the Abott district cities and you will see the 
most oppressive, anti-democratic cities throughout New Jersey. Your study 
will show that these cities are where the highest forms of unemployment &amp; 
Krime-Korruption-Khaos &amp; segregation exist.
Somebody tell Bush we got his war on terror right here - In our struggle to 
defend public education in New Jersey! New Brunswick Peoples Campaign 2002 -

&gt;
&gt;Don't go there: Bush Asks Daschle to Limit Sept. 11 Probes [Daschle
&gt;is perplexed by notion of not looking into 9-11]
&gt;
&gt;  Date: Wednesday, January 30 @ 10:09:24 EST
&gt;
&gt;  WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush personally asked Senate Majority
&gt;Leader Tom Daschle Tuesday to limit the congressional investigation
&gt;into the events of September 11, congressional and White House
&gt;sources told CNN.
&gt;  The request was made at a private meeting with congressional leaders
&gt;Tuesday morning. Sources said Bush initiated the conversation.
&gt;  He asked that only the House and Senate intelligence committees look
&gt;into the potential breakdowns among federal agencies that could have
&gt;allowed the terrorist attacks to occur, rather than a broader inquiry
&gt;that some lawmakers have proposed, the sources said.
&gt;  Tuesday's discussion followed a rare call to Daschle from Vice
&gt;President Dick Cheney last Friday to make the same request.
&gt;  "The vice president expressed the concern that a review of what
&gt;happened on September 11 would take resources and personnel away from
&gt;the effort in the war on terrorism," Daschle told reporters.
&gt;  But, Daschle said, he has not agreed to limit the investigation.
&gt;  "I acknowledged that concern, and it is for that reason that the
&gt;Intelligence Committee is going to begin this effort, trying to limit
&gt;the scope and the overall review of what happened," said Daschle, D-
&gt;South Dakota.
&gt;  "But clearly, I think the American people are entitled to know what
&gt;happened and why," he said.
&gt;  Cheney met last week in the Capitol with the chairmen of the House
&gt;and Senate intelligence committees and, according to a spokesman for
&gt;Senate Intelligence Chairman Bob Graham, D-Florida, "agreed to
&gt;cooperate with their effort."
&gt;  The heads of both intelligence committees have been meeting to map
&gt;out a way to hold a bipartisan House-Senate investigation and
&gt;hearings.
&gt;  They were discussing how the inquiry would proceed, including what
&gt;would be made public, what would remain classified, and how broad the
&gt;probe would be.
&gt;  Graham's spokesman said the committees will review intelligence
&gt;matters only.
&gt;  "How ill prepared were we and why? We are looking towards the
&gt;possibility of addressing systemic problems through legislation,"
&gt;said spokesman Paul Anderson.
&gt;  Some Democrats, such as Sens. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and
&gt;Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, have been calling for a broad
&gt;inquiry looking at various federal government agencies beyond the
&gt;intelligence community.
&gt;  "We do not meet our responsibilities to the American people if we do
&gt;not take an honest look at the federal government and all of its
&gt;agencies and let the country know what went wrong," Torricelli said.
&gt;  "The best assurance that there's not another terrorist attack on the
&gt;United States is not simply to hire more federal agents or spend more
&gt;money. It's to take an honest look at what went wrong. Who or what
&gt;failed? There's an explanation owed to the American people," he said.
&gt;  Although the president and vice president told Daschle they were
&gt;worried a wide-reaching inquiry could distract from the government's
&gt;war on terrorism, privately Democrats questioned why the White House
&gt;feared a broader investigation to determine possible culpability.
&gt;  "We will take a look at the allocation of resources. Ten thousand
&gt;federal agents -- where were they? How many assets were used, and
&gt;what signals were missed?" a Democratic senator told CNN.
&gt;  CNN Capitol Hill Producer Dana Bash and CNN Correspondents Jon Karl
&gt;and John King contributed to this report.

&gt;"I Don't Buy It"     " I was one of the first tenants in the World
&gt;Trade Center (WTC) back in 1979.  Back then----over 20 years ago----
&gt;it was known to all the tenants of the WTC that the WTC was a "no
&gt;fly" zone.  If you came within 12 miles of the WTC, flying outside of
&gt;a pattern where you were supposed to be, you were warned to back
&gt;off.  If you came within five miles, they would threaten to shoot you
&gt;down.  If you came within three miles, they could shoot you down.  If
&gt;I remember correctly, on the roof of tower No. 2 they had surface to
&gt;air missiles for that purpose, plus also the Spatz helicopters for
&gt;that purpose.       "I had a friend who was flying a small plane who
&gt;got warned away and they almost blew him out of the sky 20 years ago
&gt;because he was showing somebody a close view of the towers.      "I
&gt;can see the first tower getting hit by surprise, but 15 minutes later
&gt;the second tower also gets hit?  I don't buy it."

&gt;           An interview with Michael Springman exposes the CIA's links
&gt;with the terrorist attacks on September 11
&gt;       Straight Goods reader Ken MacAllister of Vancouver, BC writes:
&gt;       Michael Springmann worked for the US government for 20 years
&gt;with the foreign service and consulate. He just went public with the
&gt;story of his involvement in a large scale CIA operation that brought
&gt;hundreds of people from the middle east to the US, issued them
&gt;passports and trained them to be terrorists. Springmann says that the
&gt;CIA is working closely with Bin Laden and his operatives in Jeddah
&gt;and has been since 1987. The most haunting implication from this
&gt;interview is that all of the terrorist acts of late were planned and
&gt;paid for by the CIA with US taxpayers money so that the US could
&gt;legitimately bomb the hell out of Afghanistan
&gt;       The interview is riveting, and I urge you to give it a listen.

&gt;
&gt;FORMER GERMAN CABINET MINISTER ATTACKS OFFICIAL BRAINWASHING ON
&gt;SEPTEMBER 11 ISSUE
&gt;[Source: Tagesspiegel, Berlin, Jan. 13] PARTIAL TRANSLATION
&gt;
&gt;In a full-page interview with the Sunday edition (Jan. 13) of the
&gt;Berlin Tagesspiegel daily, former German Minister of Technology,
&gt;Andreas von Buelow, said he does not buy any of the official theories
&gt;that have been presented to date, on the events of September 11.
&gt;
&gt;Q: You seem so angry, really upset.
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: I can explain what's bothering me: I see that after the
&gt;horrifying attacks of Sept. 11, all political public opinion is being
&gt;forced into a direction that I consider wrong.
&gt;
&gt;Q: What do you mean by that?
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: I wonder why many questions are not asked. Normally, with
&gt;such a terrible thing, various leads and tracks appear that are then
&gt;commented on, by the investigators, the media, the government: Is
&gt;there something here or not? Are the explanations plausible? This
&gt;time, this is not the case at all. It already began just hours after
&gt;the attacks in New York and Washington and--
&gt;
&gt;Q: In those hours, there was horror, and grief.
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: Right, but actually it was astounding: There are 26
&gt;intelligence services in the U.S.A. with a budget of $30 billion--
&gt;
&gt;Q: ...more than the German defense budget...
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: --which were not able to prevent the attacks. In fact,
&gt;they didn't even have an inkling they would happen. For 60 decisive
&gt;minutes, the military and intelligence agencies let the fighter
&gt;planes stay on the ground, 48 hours later, however, the FBI presented
&gt;a list of suicide attackers. Within ten days, it emerged that seven
&gt;of them were still alive.
&gt;
&gt;Q: What, please?
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: Yes, yes. And why did the FBI chief take no position
&gt;regarding contradictions? Where the list came from, why it was false?
&gt;If I were the chief investigator (state attorney) in such a case, I
&gt;would regularly go to the public, and give information on which
&gt;leadsare valid and which not.
&gt;
&gt;Q: That sounds like--
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: --like assailants who, in their preparations, leave
&gt;tracks behind them like a herd of stampeding elephants? They made
&gt;payments with credit cards with their own names; they reported to
&gt;their flight instructors with their own names. They left behind
&gt;rented cars with flight manuals in Arabic for jumbo jets. They took
&gt;with them, on their suicide trip, wills and farewell letters, which
&gt;fall into the hands of the FBI, because they were stored in the wrong
&gt;place and wrongly addressed. Clues were left like behind like in a
&gt;child's game of hide-and-seek, which were to be followed!
&gt;
&gt;There is also the theory of one British flight engineer: According to
&gt;this, the steering of the planes was perhaps taken out ofthe pilots'
&gt;hands, from outside. The Americans had developed a method in the
&gt;1970s, whereby they could rescue hijacked planes by intervening into
&gt;the computer piloting [automatic pilot system]. This theory says,
&gt;this technique was abusedin this case. That's a theory....
&gt;
&gt;Q: Which sounds really adventurous, and was never considered.
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: You see! I do not accept this theory, but I find it worth
&gt;considering. And what about the obscure stock transactions? In
&gt;theweek prior to the attacks, the amount of transactions in stocks in
&gt;American Airlines, United Airlines, and insurance companies,
&gt;increased 1,200%. It was for a value of $15 billion. Some people must
&gt;have known something. Who?
&gt;
&gt;Q: Why don't you speculate on who it might have been.
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: With the help of the horrifying attacks, the Western mass
&gt;democracies were subjected to brainwashing. The enemy image of anti-
&gt;communism doesn't work any more; it is to be replaced by peoples of
&gt;Islamic belief. They are accused of having given birth to suicidal
&gt;terrorism.
&gt;
&gt;Q: Brainwashing? That's a tough term.
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: Yes? But the idea of the enemy image doesn't come from
&gt;me. It comes from Zbigniew Brzezinski and Samuel Huntington, two
&gt;policy-makers of American intelligence and foreign policy. Already in
&gt;the middle of he 1990s, Huntingon believed, people in Europe and
&gt;theU.S. needed someone they could hate-- this would strengthen their
&gt;identification with their own society. And Brzezinski, the mad dog,
&gt;as adviser to President Jimmy Carter, campaigned for the exclusive
&gt;right of the U.S. to seize all the raw materials of the world,
&gt;especiallyoil and gas.
&gt;
&gt;Q: You mean, the events of Sept. 11--
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: --fit perfectly in the concept of the armaments industry,
&gt;the intelligence agencies, the whole military-industrial-academic
&gt;complex. This is in fact conspicuous. The huge raw materials reserves
&gt;of the former Soviet Union are now at their disposal, also the
&gt;pipeline routes and--
&gt;
&gt;Q: Erich Follach described that at length in Spiegel: ``It's amatter
&gt;of military bases, drugs, oil and gas reserves.''
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: I can state: the planning of the attacks was technically
&gt;and organizationally a master achievement. To hijack four huge
&gt;airplanes within a few minutes and within one hour, to drive them
&gt;into their targets, with complicated flight maneuvers! This is
&gt;unthinkable, without years-long support from secret apparatuses of
&gt;the state and industry.
&gt;
&gt;Q: You are a conspiracy theorist!
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: Yeah, yeah. That's the ridicule heaped [on those raising
&gt;these questions] by those who would prefer to follow the official,
&gt;politically correct line. Even investigative journalists are fed
&gt;propaganda and disinformation. Anyone who doubts that, doesn't have
&gt;all his marbles! That is your accusation.
&gt;
&gt;Q: Your career actually speaks against the idea that you are not in
&gt;your right mind. You were already in the 1970s, state secretary in
&gt;theDefense Ministry; in 1993 you were the SPD [Social Democratic
&gt;Party] speaker in the Schalk-Golodkowski investigation committee--
&gt;
&gt;Von Buelow: And it all began there! Until that time, I did not have
&gt;any great knowledge of the work of intelligence agencies. And now we
&gt;had to take note of a great discrepancy: We shed light on the
&gt;dealings of the Stasi and other East bloc intelligence agencies in
&gt;the field of economic criminality, but as soon as we wanted to know
&gt;something about the activities of the BND [German intelligence
&gt;agency] or the CIA, it was mercilessly blocked. No information, no
&gt;cooperation, nothing! That's when I was first taken aback.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Not at war. ----- "On the surface, selling arms to a country that
&gt;sponsors terrorism, of course, clearly, you'd have to argue it's
&gt;wrong, but it's the exception sometimes that proves the rule." -
&gt;George Bush on Good Morning America. 01/28/87

SUPPORT FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS
THE QUEENS 2



�This arrest/conviction was not only political, it was racially motivated 
without a doubt.  It is political and racial because the issue at stake here 
is the state�s deep-seated fear that they had certain African people who 
would speak up and would be effective in the African community.  America 
doesn�t want any dissent. This is what this trial expressed.� 		-Abdul Majid 
(excerpt of statement to court upon sentencing)


Free The Land

To the consciously free in heart and mind, I write to you today on behalf of 
the Queens 2.  Bashir Hameed and Abdul Majid collectively known as the 
Queens 2 have been imprisoned since the early 1980�s in New York State.  
Abdul and Bashir have the distinction of having been tried three times by 
the state of New York.  Their first trial ended in a hung jury, the second 
in a mistrial and the third in a conviction.   Currently, the Queens 2 have 
a pending appeal in the eastern district of New York pertaining to a 
violation of their constitutional rights.  In their final trial the district 
attorney used 14 of their 20 votes to remove Black people from the jury 
pool.

The Queens 2 are still seeking to expose the truth and need our support to 
do so. An updated and revised version of their story is about to be 
published. This booklet will be used as a fundraiser, circulated 
internationally and printed in Spanish for the upcoming political prisoner 
strategizing conference, Tear Down The Walls. However, much of this work 
will not come to fruition without the support of individuals like you. We 
need for people to contribute whatever they can to the production of this 
booklet.  All donations can be made out to:  Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, 
1195 Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11216. Please write Queens 2 in the memo 
portion of your check and on the bottom of money orders.


In Love &amp; Struggle,
Malcolm X Grassroots Movement


P.S. We would appreciate receiving all donations by February 28, 2002. You 
may also find more information on the Queens 2 and the Tear Down The Walls 
conference at: thejerichomovement.com.

Frequently Asked Questions about the Ras Baraka Campaign for
Council-At-Large
(Newark, NJ)

Q1. Why are you running for Council-At-Large?

I'm running so that resources of public office can be better used for
working families and so that resources are redistributed into the hands
of the people. I also want to ensure that Newark's Renaissance means a
citywide rebirth, not just downtown.

Q2.  What are the main things you'd like to see changed in Newark?

Education, employment, and recreation.   I'm currently a Vice Principal
in Newark and before
that I was a public school teacher in this city for 10 years. I believe
that we need to return to
local control of our school system. I also believe that we need to raise
standards in the
classrooms by offering advanced courses and 'state of the art'
technology and resources.

On employment: while there are a mere 1,000 jobs available for our
youth this summer, we watch the tragedy of car thefts and gang
recruitment.  Newark's Renaissance must translate into more jobs for
city residents. Everyone is
entitled to a job that pays a living wage. Employment not only  provides
income and keeps our
kids out of trouble, but it gives
dignity as well.

On recreation: it needs to be meaningful, structured, and it
should  involve the entire family. Recreation just doesn't mean sports,
it includes dance, theater, computers, art, literature, trips, etc. and
can be an effective approach in developing our community - culturally
and
socially.

Q3. What are your views on crime and the police in Newark?

I know residents are concerned with the proliferation of drugs on our
streets and the growing amount of gang activity. I also share these
concerns. I am opposed to all forms of crime - be it committed by
civilians or by the police.
Education, employment, and recreation can reduce crime. Until
then,  there should be a visible level of community policing. Also, the
police should be controlled by the community, not by politicians or
police fraternities.

Q4. What do you think are your strongest assets for this position?

I have been a community activist for about 15 years, meaning that
I've been very engaged in the lives of the people of Newark. They
respect me
because of my respect for them. On top of that, I graduated from Howard
University with a Bachelor's degree in Political Science &amp; History. I
also have a Master's in
Education from St. Peters College in Jersey City.

Q5. What are your long-term political objectives? And when is the actual
election?

My only objective is to win a seat for the people of Newark. The
election is  May 2002.

          TIME TO TAKE IT PERSONAL!!!!!!!!!!!

Message:<br><br>
<pre>The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign urges folks to read and forward out this 
quick update on the case of Pedro Colon Almenas.  This text was translated 
from Spanish to English by proLibertad.  This update comes from Pedro Colon 
Almenas' support committee in Puerto Rico.

Last Sept. 10th, Pedro Colon Almenas, a student and member of the Union de 
Juventudes Socialistas and the Movimiento Socialista de Trabajdores, was 
found guilty of "Aggravated Assualt against a Military Officer" by Judge 
Hector Lafitte (an ex-JAG Lawyer, pro-navy advocate, who has made it his 
goal to punish all activists who have done civil disobedience in Vieques 
with absurd sentences).  Pedro sentencing which was first scheduled for Jan. 
22nd, has been postponed to Friday February 22nd, 2002.  Pedro could face up 
to five years in jail.  Pedro is a graduate student who has been a powerful 
student leader.  His only "crime" has been to fight for a University of 
Puerto Rico without a military/ROTC presence on it, and for demanding that 
the U.S. Navy leave Vieques.  It is important that all communites become 
aware of Pedro's case; He is a victim of a sham trial and a colonial 
government intent on jailing activists that work against the colonial status 
quo.

It is important that people check out  http://www.bander.org/pedro/  the 
site is back up and the information is in Spanish.

______________________________________________________________________
ProLibertad will be translating and sending out further emails on Pedro's 
case.

&gt;like to attend but does not have a ride, I can provide one if you contact

&gt;
&gt;    Once again, we're supposed to ignore the fact that the Green Party is 
&gt;the only progressive political party with a chance to win elections past 
&gt;the local level.
&gt;    We're supposed to ignore the fact that Ralph Nader has been helping 
&gt;people in the United States through working for tougher regulations for 
&gt;food, automotives, airlines, air and water pollution.
&gt;    We're also supposed to pretend that the Green Party is only allowed to 
&gt;eliminate Democrats and Republicans at the local level, but not at the 
&gt;national level.
&gt;    This is called being a "frightened liberal", defined as a person who is 
&gt;supposedly wants social chang, but believes we mustn't attack if the 
&gt;Republicans (i.e. "The Bad Guys") might beat the Democrats.
&gt;    In the eyes of the frightenend liberal, all Republicans are evil, 
&gt;(unless the FL is put on the spot, then maybe John McCain is okay), and the 
&gt;Democrats aren't that great, but we don't want the
&gt;Republicans to win!
&gt;    Joe Smith and other Frightened Liberals will bombard this and other 
&gt;green list they can find. They do not have new ideas, they have only 
&gt;complaints. They will use warped logic that applies to the lowest 
&gt;denomameter in the human spirit. This is why I asked that Joe Smith be 
&gt;removed from the list two months ago. This is a Green Party list, and since 
&gt;Joe Smith is dislikes and resents us so much, he shouldn't be here.
&gt;    Now let's get to work!
&gt;                                   Peacefully,
&gt;                                          Ray Higbee

&gt;
&gt;If anyone would liek to attend these events. Please feel free to walk in on 
&gt;the day of! Beat seating is available if you contact either myself (Ray 
&gt;Higbee, Secretary of the Green Party) at whcoon@... or Steve Welzer at 
&gt;ecovillager@..., enjoy!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;SAVE THE DATES!
&gt;
&gt;IMPORTANT GREEN PARTY EVENTS IN MARCH AND APRIL
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Event #1: Petition Drive Kick-off for NJ Green Campaign 2002
&gt;
&gt;Date: Saturday, March 9    11:00am to 2:00pm
&gt;Location: Rutgers Labor Education Center, Room 115
&gt;
&gt;The Greens expect to be fielding one of our most extensive slates this 
&gt;year, running candidates for national, state, county, and municipal 
&gt;offices.  Among others, GPNJ Chair Joseph Fortunato will be running for 
&gt;U.S. Congress and Vice Chair Jane Hunter will be running for council in her 
&gt;home town of Bound Brook.  We are still soliciting candidates, and we hope 
&gt;all locals will encourage one or several of their members to step forward 
&gt;to take the Green Party message to the voters in some capacity next fall.
&gt;
&gt;In our highest-visibility race this year Ted Glick, National Coordinator of 
&gt;the Independent Progressive Politics Network, will be the Green Party 
&gt;candidate challenging for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Robert 
&gt;Torricelli.  Ted has been a prominent activist for decades and has 
&gt;participated in a wide range of struggles -- such that we expect his 
&gt;candidacy to resonate among peace, environment, labor, minority, and other 
&gt;social change activists all across the state.  To show the extent of 
&gt;support for this campaign we'd like to submit more petition signatures than 
&gt;we've ever done before.  As Greens and supporters hit the streets this 
&gt;spring to gather signatures for local candidates (all petitions must be 
&gt;submitted by the first week of June) we will be encouraging everyone to 
&gt;carry a clipboard with a Glick for Senate petition.
&gt;
&gt;Please join us March 9 to meet our candidates and discuss strategy for NJ 
&gt;Green Campaign 2002!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Event #2: GPNJ Sixth Annual Convention
&gt;
&gt;Date: Sunday, April 28    9:00am to 4:30pm
&gt;Location: Rutgers Labor Education Center, Main Auditorium
&gt;
&gt;The Green Party has emerged as New Jersey's leading alternative party.  Our 
&gt;bedrock principles of nonviolence, grassroots democracy, social justice, 
&gt;and environmental protection have never been more relevant than in this 
&gt;period of national crisis and apprehension.
&gt;
&gt;The Annual Convention is a time for members to make their voices heard on 
&gt;the variety of issues that face our party, to sign up to participate on 
&gt;statewide committees, to modify the organizational bylaws, and to elect 
&gt;party officers.  Non-members are welcome to join us as observers--check out 
&gt;this dynamic new party and learn about the international movement for Green 
&gt;politics.  An extensive collection of Green Party literature will be 
&gt;available.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So save the dates!  Join us March 9 and April 28 in New Brunswick!
&gt;
&gt;

Subject:A special Invite...<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>This is an invite to all the organizations and individuals that work with or 
support ProLibertad and the Malcom X Grassroots Movement...

Solidarity folks,

This is Benjamin Ramos of the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign, I am sending 
this email out as an invitation and inquiry for endorsement for a very 
special activity that is coming up on March 9th.  On Saturday March 9th, The 
Malcom X Grassroots movement and ProLibertad are putting together a special 
forum on the Patriot Act and how it effects our organizing in communities.

Kamau Franklin, of MXGM, will be putting together a panel of lawyers that 
will address the issues of immigration, FBI repression and a basic "What is 
the Patriot Act?" analysis.  It will be held at Hunter College West building 
6th floor room 615 from 1pm-3pm, e68th St. and Lexington Avenue.

This forum's goal is to educate  the community around the new legislation 
and how it will and has already effected our anti war work, our political 
prisoner work, our anti-imperialism, and immigration work.  It is shocking 
that many in all our communities (especially the people of color activist 
community) are unaware of the new blatantly repressive/pro-facist 
legislation that has become common law.

I invite you all to the forum, but more importantly I ask you to endorse 
this forum.  Please lend your organizations' name and promotional resources 
for this event.  I ask that if you endorse the forum that you get the flyer 
and mobilize your organization and its constituents to come it out.  We ask 
you to send out the info. to your email lists, to send out the flyers in 
your mailings and to adversitse the activity on any media sources you have 
access to as well.

We need to build this forum and get our communities educated.  We are in a 
repressive time and we must be informed.  Our work and security are at 
stake.  Let us fill those seats with our communities.

Please email me ( uriyoan@... ) with your organizational endorsement 
and to ask for the flyer.  An endorsement list will also be sent with the 
flyer.  This list will be constantly be updated until March 9th, 2002.

               Tammy Paolino: Mural projects give vision of city life 
through the eyes of their artists

               Published in the Home News Tribune 2/16/02

               I have lots of favorite things to do in Philadelphia.

               I love to take in a folk show at the Tin Angel, for instance. 
I also love to go to the Vet and watch the Yankees whoop the Phils, and 
maybe even grab a late-night cheesesteak at Pat's Steaks.

               When in Philly, I enjoy a visit to the Rodin Museum, shopping 
in Manyunk, a leisurely brunch with the bo-hos at the Morning Glory, or a 
rainy afternoon browsing at Tower Records.

               While I'm doing all of that, I have another favorite thing to 
do -- checking out the murals that adorn the brick faces and exposed walls 
of buildings throughout the City of Brotherly Love.

               All over town, larger-than-life images of historical figures, 
professional athletes, ballerinas and jazz musicians, hot-house flowers, 
geometric abstractions, and, these days, especially, bursts of patriotism, 
loom above the taxis and minivans and buses and huddled masses that fill the 
streets.

               Philadephia's murals are a result of The Mural Arts Project, 
a program administered by the city's recreation department. In addition to 
beautification, the projects' goals are to eliminate "graffiti vandalism" 
and to "(expand) educational visual arts opportunities throughout the 
Philadelphia region."

               Through the program, artists and kids - including some of 
those interested in graffiti art and spray cans -- work together to create 
art in public spaces throughout the city.

               Here at home, murals can be found in some downtown areas -- 
including several colorful works scattered around downtown New Brunswick. In 
March, for instance, the Hungarian-American Athletic Club on Somerset Street 
offered a wall of its building for a mural dedicated to the Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

               New Brunswick has so much to celebrate -- what with its rich 
ethnic diversity, its proximity to the river and the D&amp;R canal, its 
reputation as a cultural center for the arts and, of course, its growing 
prominence as a leader in medical research and health care.

               Murals are an enduring and dramatic way to pay tribute to 
civic leaders and local heroes, recall historical events, encourage civic  
pride, or just add some urban charm to an otherwise drab section of town.

               The People's Community Arts Mural Project of New Brunswick 
has several public mural projects planned throughout the city. CAMP 
volunteers -- artists, community leaders, students and others interested in 
sprucing things up -- work weekends on mural
projects in the area. (Those interested in picking up a paint brush can 
contact Tamara Dahan at tamaradahan@... or Maura Carey at 
mauracarey@...)

               Collaborative public art projects are meant to bring diverse 
groups of people together in an ongoing conversation about their vision of 
their neighborhood, their city and their world.

               While the Mural Project is likely to benefit from the many 
talented artists and art students from the New Brunswick and Rutgers 
University communities, the program will have an even greater impact on the 
city if members of lots of other groups get involved as well.

               It's my hope, for instance, that the graffiti artists 
currently showcasing their talents in the cavernous tunnels and on the 
towering bridges along Route 18 will grab their spray cans, come into the 
light and make their marks where they will really count.

               Tammy Paolino's column appears every Saturday. (732)

Subject:Re: [TheHubCityNJ] Make school board accountable to citizens<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>all the injuries inflicted on the community at the 1/15 board of ed mtg are 
'reprehensible'.  the issue is to fix responsibility on the antagonists.

but none of those 'reprehensible occurences' shd distract from the massive, 
daily 'reprehensible occurence' of nb's pitiful education record, to which 
we are all 'witness'.  for instance, the cut in funding suffered by the 
Puerto Rican Action Board's early childhood development center, at the hands 
of the un-elected board of education, which prefers to give public nb 
dollars to a private charter school and a private high school, over which 
the community has no democratic control.

there is no excuse whatever, given the vast wealth and education resources 
to be found in this city, why nb public school students shd not be provided 
the highest level of education imaginable. this despite the conspicuous (and 
likewise inexcusable) local poverty and related social degradation.  rather, 
it is most disingenuous to suggest eliminating these problems w/o first

I can't comment much on the incident at the BOE meeting for I was not a
witness; nevertheless it is my understanding that Police Chief Don Bowling
was bitten during a scuffle, a reprehensible occurrence.
I agree that all Boards of Educations should be accountable to parents, 
their
natural constituency.  I question, though, some of the reasoning used or
implied in this letter.
All New Brunswick BOE members do and must reside in New Brunswick, and it is
my understanding that most of those that have school-aged children have them
attending city schools.   What would assure the elected Board members have
their children attend city schools?
Performance at Lincoln School must be scrutinized, particularly because of
Rutgers' acclaimed involvement in the academic "enhancement" of this
particular school. But to compare New Brunswick schools to the State average
is inappropriate.
Although the district possesses a great deal of issues that need 
improvement,
the majority of the students attending New Brunswick Public Schools are
affected by many environmental factors that influence negatively on their
performance.  Poverty, overcrowded housing conditions, substance abuse,
delinquency, teen pregnancy, the inability of many parents to assist 
children
with coursework because of their lack of command of English or their work
schedules, among many other things, have a definite impact.  When compared 
to
other urban areas that share the same intensity of problems and barriers, 
New
Brunswick schools do surprisingly well.

Lastly, if 65 percent of the children enrolled in the public school district
is Latino, and most of their parents cannot yet vote - although contributing
to society and the tax base, whom will elected Board members represent?
Which constituency will be represented?  Could it be Senior Citizens on 
fixed
incomes - which have the highest percentage of participants in elections -
whom because of the unjust NJ tax structure are obliged to endeavor to 
reduce
their property taxes?  Moreover, I keep getting flashbacks of the abuses of
the elected Board in Newark and the patronage and corruption that occurred
there without concern for the welfare of students.

An elected Board might be a good idea.  But we need sound arguments to
support the question.

<pre>The cut in funding this year of ALL New Brunswick community preschool 
providers was enacted by the State Department of Education (it's still under 
appeal).  In order to equalize education between richer and poorer districts, 
the Supreme Court Abbott decision requires preschool - paid by the State - in 
the poorer districts.  That same Department, because of State legislation, 
requires local school districts to fund Charter Schools approved by the 
State.  Again, no local control of the issue, whatever type of Board exists.

The private High School is another matter.  Public dollars directed to a 
large absentee for-profit company is distasteful.  I'm waiting to see if it 
will be successful, and if it will hurt the main High School student 
population.  I'm also interested in the demographics of the school, and the 
demographics of the Charter School, for that matter.

I must totally agree that "there is no excuse whatever, given the vast wealth 
and education resources to be found in this city, why New Brunswick public 
school students should not be provided the highest level of education 
imaginable."  The available resources are not interacting effectively.

By the way, I didn't mean to prioritize any social problem over another.  
They all need attention.  Nonetheless, performance will be affected by 
environmental factors, even if students are provided the highest level of 
education imaginable.

My position on Latino parents is that now they DO have representation in the 
school Board.   With an elected Board …….. ?   Maybe.

Regardless, I still believe that an elected Board might be a good idea.  But 
we need sound arguments to support the question.  Maybe individuals that 
would run for an elected Board should begin disseminating platforms 
explaining how they could make the necessary changes?   If they have the 
answers, I'm sure the community would back them.

Subject:Elected board of education vs. an appointed one<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I apologize for interrupting your day, but I hope that this message should 
spark some interest.

I just wanted to comment on the issue of an elected board of education 
versus an appointed one in New Brunswick, NJ raised recently by Cliff Smith 
and an individual whom I've never met known simply as Guillo on the People's 
Campaign message group. Because of the length of this message, I took the 
liberty of providing for a table of contents.


I.   Arguments over an elected board of education in detail
II.  Arguments over an elected board of education, condensed
III. Advice on appeals to democracy
IV.  Letters to the editor
V.   Miscellaneous

Contact info: Sash Zlatanovic, 732-208-0000 &amp; 732-342-9224


I'm also sending this message to many others, including members of the 
media, who might find this subject rather interesting. Below is a short 
one-paragraph description of this ongoing issue, after which the main body 
of my arguments will follow.

For years, the New Brunswick board of education has been appointed by Mayor 
James Cahill and many referenda have been placed on the ballot to answer 
this pressing question about what to do as New Brunswick schools are failing 
as health services and regular program instruction have been significantly 
cut for the schools, which could be said is being overlooked because many 
students are from poor Hispanic and black families. In 2000, this referendum 
was defeated by a margin of less than 1,000 votes. The mayor, elected by 
less than 12% of New Brunswick residents in 1998, has no real mandate and 
complacent voters have fallen victim to the Committee to Keep Politics Out 
of Our Schools, a political campaign that had raised slightly over $4,000 
from unreported contributors in addition to being investigated by the state 
Election Law Enforcement Commission in previous years.

Hopefully, members of the media will help raise awareness to this issue with 
these arguments and, in turn, many will find it helpful to read these 
articles.




I. ARGUMENTS OVER AN ELECTED BOE IN DETAIL




Much like having our government officials elected by the public, members of 
the New Brunswick board of education would be far better held accountable to 
the public--parents, students and residents alike--if they were to be 
elected rather than appointed. Members of the board of education would be 
residents of New Brunswick and would be held responsible for any failure to 
provide appropriate education directly by those who are most affected by it.

However much the mayor and his supporters would like to condemn the election 
of board members as introducing politics into the New Brunswick school 
system overlook one simple thing: their appointment is just as political. 
Patronage and nepotism abound to such an excess in such a system, though, 
that an elected board system is far more advantageous than otherwise. This 
would help explain why most other school districts--referring to the 
hundreds of districts in the state as well as the thousands outside 
it--prefer an elected system.

Does the mayor seriously think that he knows better than the hundreds of 
thousands who participate in elected board systems either as candidates or 
as voters? I suppose he does, the mayor's power over city education being 
rivaled only by his ego.

However, I should caution, though. From my own personal experience, two 
major drawbacks to having an elected board are that, first, the school 
budget is also open to defeat at the ballots since it, too, would be decided 
upon by the voters and, second, many vote for those who know little about 
good public policy.

Nevertheless, at first glance, these two seem to raise some concerns. 
However, even if it were the case that school budgets would be routinely and 
even at times soundly defeated, the state does provide an appeals process. 
Without going into too much detail, the budget would be appealed to the 
superintendent and eventually the state department of education. Eventually, 
the budget is nonetheless implemented, often at the discretion of appointed 
officials, but at least the public were allowed an opportunity to voice its 
opinion on the budget. Even indirectly, the public has an influence on how 
the budget is formulated through the election of board members, so it's the 
case that the public is altogether ignored on budget issues.

As for having people with no sense of good public policy being elected, I 
should point out that what is "good" public policy--one in which as many 
members of the public as possible benefit--should abstractly have various 
interests well balanced, leading to an acceptable policy that would be as 
broad and appealing as possible. Perhaps this definition may not be 
acceptable to some, but I wanted to avoid specifics to mention that board 
members would be sufficiently held accountable by the public and instances 
whereby cousins vote for one another when they know nothing about what to do 
for the common good would be rare and far apart, to say the least.

Nonetheless, I think it's safe to say that, when important school programs 
have been severely cut to such a degree that schools are no longer schools 
but run down human warehouses and day care centers and the BOE has failed to 
provide proper education, the New Brunswick BOE has failed the city and its 
children in no uncertain terms.

Be that as it may, whatever arguments that opponents to an elected board may 
raise fall short of persuasion if one were to realize that the vast majority 
of other school districts have boards that are elected, many of which 
oversee schools that are far better than New Brunswick's. I'm not trying to 
draw causation from this observation, but there's certainly a correlation. 
Moreover, those that remain appointed are largely school districts that have 
politicians whose interests are better served if they have direct and 
uninhibited control over education policy.




II. ARGUMENTS OVER AN ELECTED BOE, CONDENSED




In an elected board system, in short, board members are effectively far 
better held accountable than those appointed whose positions raise questions 
about patronage, a corrupting and counterproductive influence.

Guillo insisted on sound arguments and I hope I provided for these. In case 
if anyone wanted something short but comprehensive, here's a list of 
advantages of an elected board versus disadvantages and, if we were to weigh 
one against the other, a sensible person would agree that an elected system 
is far better.

SET A. Arguments in favor of an elected system
1. Members of the BOE held accountable to standards of success
2. Patronage and nepotism are far less likely
3. Interests are better represented
4. Members of the BOE more likely to be open to the public

SET B1. Arguments against an elected system
1. School budgets may be defeated
2. Politicizes education
3. Mayor has less control over education policy
4. Popular control takes away from professional control (if one were to 
believe that patronage of unqualified individuals leads to professionalism)

SET B2. Counter-arguments against opposition to an elected system
1. There's an appeals process for defeated budgets, so funding wouldn't 
actually be detrimentally affected
2. Education is politicized anyway when a government official appoints and 
anything that can garner opinion and criticism is political by nature, so 
"politics" is inevitably unavoidable
3. Concentration of influence over public policy (e.g., in the form of a 
mayorally appointed BOE) has never been compatible with American political 
thought anyway for obvious reasons
4. Tens of thousands of school districts have elected BOE's and 
professionals would still have an incredible influence over education policy 
by advising the public and board members

N.b. Each point to sets B1 and B2 correspond with one another. For example, 
point #1 in set B2 (in favor of an elected BOE) is a response to point #1 in 
set B1 (opposed to an elected BOE).




III. ADVICE ON APPEALS TO DEMOCRACY.




Concerning appeals to democracy, I don't often make such arguments because 
it sounds demagogic. These arguments are actually unappealing to many, many 
voters. However, I would suggest, instead, using the above arguments to make 
the same conclusion that appeals to democracy would make: more 
accountability encourages better public policy. By not making such appeals 
to democracy--which more or less appeals to one's emotion toward democracy 
rather than intellect--we avoid having accusations of demagoguery and 
charges of introducing politics into schools--which certainly does appeal to 
many other voters who might otherwise support us had we chosen better 
words--made against us.

In fact, many, many people would prefer wise public policy over popular 
control. However, to avoid this dilemma, we should link the two together: 
through accountability, better education policy would take hold. (See parts 
I and II.) Nevertheless, appeals to democracy are blindly populist and it 
succeeds in turning off voters and I suggest using more substantive 
arguments rather than, at least in my opinion, emotional appeals.




IV. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR




Tomorrow evening the BOE will meet at the high school on Livingston. I would 
suggest, if anyone's interested, people should post messages on this message 
board or email me that would be in support of an elected board or if there 
are any criticisms that I may have overlooked. In addition, I'd like people 
to volunteer to present each of the bulleted arguments from the above list 
of arguments in both letters to the editor and at city council and BOE 
meetings. The next BOE meeting is at 7:30pm at the New Brunswick High School 
along Livingston Ave on February 19th and the next city council meeting is 
at 7pm at the New Brunswick City Hall at 78 Bayard on February 20th.




V. MISC.




Anyone who prefers to read a much shorter message that goes straight to the 
point, please refer to the Home News Tribune letter to the editor from 
February 8th. I strongly recommend others to use material presented in this 
email to support an elected board of education for no better reasons than 
wanting better education policy (in turn, safer streets and better standards 
of living) and greater accessibility and openness for the public in the form 
of a letter to the editor. If you wish more information can certainly be 
provided from many weeks of research; just email me.

For those in favor of an elected BOE, I would suggest taking into account my 
advice, because I believe that in doing so we increase our chances of 
success and progress toward better education. For those opposed, I would 
suggest refining your arguments and present them to me and I will, most 
certainly, thoroughly destroy them.

I hope to hear from you soon and I sincerely thank you for having read this 
rather long message.

Subject:For the Independent Peaceful Reunification of Korea<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Kim Il Sung

From the Speech at the 15th Anniversary Celebration of the August 15 
Liberation, the National Holiday of the Korean People [Excerpt]

August 14, 1960


So long as an aggressive army of foreign imperialism exists in his 
territory, no one can speak of his national independence not can the people 
live in peace.  At present, the root cause of our country�s division and off 
all misery and sufferings of the south Korean people lies in the occupation 
of south Korea by the aggressive army of the U.S. imperialists and their 
aggressive policy.  As long as south Korea is in the grip of that army, the 
peaceful reunification of our country will never be realized, nor will the 
south Korean people be free from the present miserable plight.

The U.S. imperialist aggressor army which is occupying south Korea is the 
ringleader of the reactionary forces there.  It is a band of robbers 
plundering the south Korean people of their properties and perpetrating all 
sorts of atrocities.  This imperialist aggressor army of the United States, 
the ringleader of reaction and gangsterism, is th e primary target in the 
struggle of the south Korean people.

Therefore, the workers, peasants and all other sections of the population of 
south Korea must, first of all, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist 
aggressive forces and fight to force their army out of south Korea.  When 
all the patriotic people in south Korea rise as one in the anti-U.S. 
struggle, these aggressors will be unable to stay there but will be 
compelled to withdraw�

Today the U.S. imperialists, dismayed at the awakening of the south Korean 
people and their unceasing struggle, are resorting to every trick to 
maintain their colonial rule over south Korea.  They are bringing new-type 
weapons into south Korea, reinforcing their troops there and intensifying 
war preparations, while frantically trying to put the paralyzed puppet 
ruling apparatus in order.  The south Korean reactionary clique is trying to 
dampen the fighting spirit of the people by means of repression and 
deception, faithfully carrying out the orders of their American masters�

Today the south Korean people are in an indescribably wretched plight.  The 
wages of the workers are less than one-third of the minimum living costs, 
and even their payment is usually overdue a few months, sometimes more than 
half a year.  Peasants are cruelly exploited by landlords and usurers.  Most 
of them are under heavy debts, and over one million peasant households run 
out of food every year.  Millions of unemployed and semi-employed are on the 
verge of starvation, and hundreds of children are wandering around and 
begging in the streets�

Comrades, the only way to save the present situation in south Korea and 
finally solve the Korean question lies in driving out the U.S. army and 
reunifying the country peacefully.

The peaceful reunification of our country must be achieved independently by 
holding free general elections throughout north and south Korea on a 
democratic basis without any foreign interference.  This is our consistent 
stand on the question of national reunification�

The south Korean rulers say that they cannot accept a free north-south 
general election because it means �collaboration with the Communists� and 
involves the danger of being �communized.�

However, those who really want to fight for the people and defend the 
interests of the nation will never be afraid of the Communists or oppose 
�collaboration with the Communists,� because the Communists always work for 
the people; they are the most ardent defender of the national interests and 
the staunchest patriots.  This was why the Japanese imperialists feared the 
Korean Communists more than anybody else and repressed them most ruthlessly�

We Communists always maintain that we will closely unite and cooperate with 
all political parties, social organizations and individual personages that 
fight for peaceful reunification and national independence.  We will 
cooperate with all persons, regardless of their past, if they come out for 
the peaceful reunification of the country�

There is no denying the fact that the most reasonable and realistic way to 
peaceful national reunification is to hold free north-south general 
elections on a democratic basis without any foreign interference.  We appeal 
to all the political parties and social organizations and the people of all 
walks of life in south Korea to come out for holding such elections.

If the south Korean authorities still cannot agree to free north-south 
general elections for fear of the whole of south Korea being communized, 
then we must work out, to start with, even transitional measures for 
settling the burning problems of the nation.

As one of such measures, we propose that a Confederation of north and south 
Korea be instituted.  We propose to establish the Confederation by way of 
setting up a supreme national committee composed of the representatives of 
the Government of the Democratic People�s Republic of Korea and the 
Government of the �Republic of Korea� mainly to regulate the economic and 
cultural development of north and south Korea in a uniform manner, while 
retaining, for the time being, the present political systems in north and 
south Korea and maintaining the independent activities of the two 
governments.

The establishment of such a Confederation will enable the north and the 
south to understand and cooperate with each other by ensuring contacts and 
negotiations between them and removing mutual distrust.  We consider that, 
if the free north-south elections are held under such circumstances, the 
complete peaceful reunification of our country can be realized.

In particular, the establishment of such a Confederation will make it 
possible to save south Korea from economic ruin by having the supreme 
national committee consider economic and cultural matters beneficial to the 
whole nation and ensure economic and cultural exchanges and mutual 
cooperation between north and south Korea, even though the Confederation 
does not  mean the formation of a united coalition government representing 
all social strata and therefore cannot exercise united state leadership�

If the south Korean authorities consider that even the Confederation we 
propose is still unacceptable to them, we once again propose that a purely 
economic commission composed of representatives of the business circles of 
north and south Korea be set up to exchange goods between the north and the 
south and to cooperate with and help each other in economic construction.  
Thus, we must, first of all, relieve the brothers and sisters in south Korea 
from hunger and poverty, setting aside the political question.

Along with the economic exchange between the north and the south, cultural 
exchange should be conducted on an extensive scale and the people allowed to 
travel freely.

The Korean nation is a homogenous nation with the same language, spoken and 
written, and has inherited the same historical and cultural traditions.  
However, we have been separated from each other for fifteen years, unable to 
visit each other, meet each other and even write to each other.  
Consequently, even our language is gradually changing in a different way in 
the two zones, and so are our culture and customs.  Worse still, decadent 
Yankee culture and the American way of life hold sway and our national 
culture and the beautiful customs of our people are being trampled upon in 
south Korea.

This hinders the uniform development of our nation and, in particular, 
threatens the danger of plunging south Korea into an inescapable quagmire of 
corruption and degeneration.

We should under no circumstances allow ourselves to ruin the future destiny 
of the nation on account of political antagonism and thus commit crimes 
indelible for generations to come.

We once again propose that the mutual visit of cultural missions and mutual 
exchanges in science, culture, arts, sports and in all other fields be 
effected between the north and the south.  At least, correspondence should 
be made possible between parents and children, brothers and sisters, 
relatives and friends, and the people allowed to travel freely across the 
country�

In order to solve these questions, representatives of north and south Korea 
should, first of all, get together and negotiate.  Unscrupulously saying 
this is wrong, this is impossible, or something in a similar vein, even 
before meeting and talking with each other, is not a proper attitude 
favoring the solution of questions.  Such an attitude benefits only the U.S. 
imperialists who are trying to keep our nation split and pit our people 
against each other and turn south Korea into their permanent colony.  If we 
keep ourselves divided and our doors shut to each other, the situation will 
be further aggravated and south Korean people will suffer greater misery and 
hardships.

We propose to the south Korean authorities, political parties, social 
organizations and individual personages that representatives of north and 
south Korea meet at the earliest date in Pyong-yang, Seoul, or at Panmunjom 
to negotiate about all the above issues.

There is no reason why the Koreans, one and the same nation, should not meet 
together and negotiate.  Why should we, people in the north, continue to 
hold talks with the Yankees about the question of our own country at 
Panmunjom, a place in our own land?  Why should the south Korean people be 
deprived of their seats by the Yankees?  The Yankees must pull out and 
Koreans should sit together and discuss the Korean question.

All political parties, social organizations and individual personages in 
south Korea should demand that the north and the south hold negotiations as 
soon as possible.  All patriotic people in south Korea must struggle for 
economic and cultural exchange between the north and the south, for the 
reduction of the vast army of south Korea and for free north-south general 
elections.

The peaceful reunification of our country can by no means be easily 
achieved.  We must not forget even for a moment that the U.S. imperialists, 
the ringleaders of world reaction, are occupying south Korea.  The peaceful 
reunification of the country can be achieved only by a persistent struggle 
of all the Korean people.

When the socialist forces are further strengthened in the northern half of 
the Republic and all the patriotic forces in south Korea firmly unite and 
turn out in the decisive struggle against the U.S. imperialists and their 
lackeys, we will be able to drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors out of 
south Korea and accomplish the great historic task of the peaceful 
reunification of our country.

Subject:NEW PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER!!<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is sending this urgent alert out to let the 
various communities we work with that as of this afternoon;

Pedro Colon Almenas is the 7th Puerto Rican Political Prisoner!!  he was 
sentenced to one year in jail (to possibly served in PR) and three years of 
probation!!

Pedro Colon Almenas was sentenced today in a court room packed with hundreds 
of youth/students/supporters in Puerto Rico.  According to an over the phone 
report we received this early evening, the youth/students of Puerto Rico 
organized a massive total island student strike that had amazing 
ramifications throughout the island yesterday, there were various solidarity 
activities/vigils and press events this week that created an  amazing 
pressure on Judge Hector Lafitte (a pro-Navy ex-JAG lawyer infamous for his 
serving out outrageous sentences to civil disobedients).  This pressure 
forced Lafitte to sentence pedro to a year and three years of probation in 
stead of the possible 3-5 years that the prosecution was pushing.

A more detailed report will come throughout the weekend as well as the 
Committee in Solidairty with Pedro's press statement.

FREE THE PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONERS!!

Message:<br><br>
<pre>That was before 1966, when the idea of "Juche" ceased to be identifiable
with the independent will of Koreans to build their own form of socialism,
and became instead a thin veil to justify the deification of Kim Il Sung,
orchestrated by Kim Yong Il.  Since then, North Korea has been nothing short
of a fascist monarchy, with likely only the poverty and mismanagement of the
North restraining the expansionistic appetites that typically accompany
fascism.

Identifying North Korea as an ally of progressive movements merely because
it is on the U.S. government's 'shit list' is a mistake.  We would do best
to denounce equally the arrogance and ignorance of GWB's sabre-rattling as
well as the dismal path of North Korean 'socialism.'

Chris

P.S. One can have little doubt that if Kim Il Sung's calls, as outlined in
your quote, were answered today, Kim Yong Il would find himself without a
job on a moment's notice.

Subject: [nbpc] For the Independent Peaceful Reunification of Korea


Kim Il Sung

From the Speech at the 15th Anniversary Celebration of the August 15
Liberation, the National Holiday of the Korean People [Excerpt]

August 14, 1960


So long as an aggressive army of foreign imperialism exists in his
territory, no one can speak of his national independence not can the people
live in peace.  At present, the root cause of our country�s division and off
all misery and sufferings of the south Korean people lies in the occupation
of south Korea by the aggressive army of the U.S. imperialists and their
aggressive policy.  As long as south Korea is in the grip of that army, the
peaceful reunification of our country will never be realized, nor will the
south Korean people be free from the present miserable plight.

The U.S. imperialist aggressor army which is occupying south Korea is the
ringleader of the reactionary forces there.  It is a band of robbers
plundering the south Korean people of their properties and perpetrating all
sorts of atrocities.  This imperialist aggressor army of the United States,
the ringleader of reaction and gangsterism, is th e primary target in the
struggle of the south Korean people.

Therefore, the workers, peasants and all other sections of the population of
south Korea must, first of all, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist
aggressive forces and fight to force their army out of south Korea.  When
all the patriotic people in south Korea rise as one in the anti-U.S.
struggle, these aggressors will be unable to stay there but will be
compelled to withdraw�

Today the U.S. imperialists, dismayed at the awakening of the south Korean
people and their unceasing struggle, are resorting to every trick to
maintain their colonial rule over south Korea.  They are bringing new-type
weapons into south Korea, reinforcing their troops there and intensifying
war preparations, while frantically trying to put the paralyzed puppet
ruling apparatus in order.  The south Korean reactionary clique is trying to
dampen the fighting spirit of the people by means of repression and
deception, faithfully carrying out the orders of their American masters�

Today the south Korean people are in an indescribably wretched plight.  The
wages of the workers are less than one-third of the minimum living costs,
and even their payment is usually overdue a few months, sometimes more than
half a year.  Peasants are cruelly exploited by landlords and usurers.  Most
of them are under heavy debts, and over one million peasant households run
out of food every year.  Millions of unemployed and semi-employed are on the
verge of starvation, and hundreds of children are wandering around and
begging in the streets�

Comrades, the only way to save the present situation in south Korea and
finally solve the Korean question lies in driving out the U.S. army and
reunifying the country peacefully.

The peaceful reunification of our country must be achieved independently by
holding free general elections throughout north and south Korea on a
democratic basis without any foreign interference.  This is our consistent
stand on the question of national reunification�

The south Korean rulers say that they cannot accept a free north-south
general election because it means �collaboration with the Communists� and
involves the danger of being �communized.�

However, those who really want to fight for the people and defend the
interests of the nation will never be afraid of the Communists or oppose
�collaboration with the Communists,� because the Communists always work for
the people; they are the most ardent defender of the national interests and
the staunchest patriots.  This was why the Japanese imperialists feared the
Korean Communists more than anybody else and repressed them most ruthlessly�

We Communists always maintain that we will closely unite and cooperate with
all political parties, social organizations and individual personages that
fight for peaceful reunification and national independence.  We will
cooperate with all persons, regardless of their past, if they come out for
the peaceful reunification of the country�

There is no denying the fact that the most reasonable and realistic way to
peaceful national reunification is to hold free north-south general
elections on a democratic basis without any foreign interference.  We appeal
to all the political parties and social organizations and the people of all
walks of life in south Korea to come out for holding such elections.

If the south Korean authorities still cannot agree to free north-south
general elections for fear of the whole of south Korea being communized,
then we must work out, to start with, even transitional measures for
settling the burning problems of the nation.

As one of such measures, we propose that a Confederation of north and south
Korea be instituted.  We propose to establish the Confederation by way of
setting up a supreme national committee composed of the representatives of
the Government of the Democratic People�s Republic of Korea and the
Government of the �Republic of Korea� mainly to regulate the economic and
cultural development of north and south Korea in a uniform manner, while
retaining, for the time being, the present political systems in north and
south Korea and maintaining the independent activities of the two
governments.

The establishment of such a Confederation will enable the north and the
south to understand and cooperate with each other by ensuring contacts and
negotiations between them and removing mutual distrust.  We consider that,
if the free north-south elections are held under such circumstances, the
complete peaceful reunification of our country can be realized.

In particular, the establishment of such a Confederation will make it
possible to save south Korea from economic ruin by having the supreme
national committee consider economic and cultural matters beneficial to the
whole nation and ensure economic and cultural exchanges and mutual
cooperation between north and south Korea, even though the Confederation
does not  mean the formation of a united coalition government representing
all social strata and therefore cannot exercise united state leadership�

If the south Korean authorities consider that even the Confederation we
propose is still unacceptable to them, we once again propose that a purely
economic commission composed of representatives of the business circles of
north and south Korea be set up to exchange goods between the north and the
south and to cooperate with and help each other in economic construction.
Thus, we must, first of all, relieve the brothers and sisters in south Korea
from hunger and poverty, setting aside the political question.

Along with the economic exchange between the north and the south, cultural
exchange should be conducted on an extensive scale and the people allowed to
travel freely.

The Korean nation is a homogenous nation with the same language, spoken and
written, and has inherited the same historical and cultural traditions.
However, we have been separated from each other for fifteen years, unable to
visit each other, meet each other and even write to each other.
Consequently, even our language is gradually changing in a different way in
the two zones, and so are our culture and customs.  Worse still, decadent
Yankee culture and the American way of life hold sway and our national
culture and the beautiful customs of our people are being trampled upon in
south Korea.

This hinders the uniform development of our nation and, in particular,
threatens the danger of plunging south Korea into an inescapable quagmire of
corruption and degeneration.

We should under no circumstances allow ourselves to ruin the future destiny
of the nation on account of political antagonism and thus commit crimes
indelible for generations to come.

We once again propose that the mutual visit of cultural missions and mutual
exchanges in science, culture, arts, sports and in all other fields be
effected between the north and the south.  At least, correspondence should
be made possible between parents and children, brothers and sisters,
relatives and friends, and the people allowed to travel freely across the
country�

In order to solve these questions, representatives of north and south Korea
should, first of all, get together and negotiate.  Unscrupulously saying
this is wrong, this is impossible, or something in a similar vein, even
before meeting and talking with each other, is not a proper attitude
favoring the solution of questions.  Such an attitude benefits only the U.S.
imperialists who are trying to keep our nation split and pit our people
against each other and turn south Korea into their permanent colony.  If we
keep ourselves divided and our doors shut to each other, the situation will
be further aggravated and south Korean people will suffer greater misery and
hardships.

We propose to the south Korean authorities, political parties, social
organizations and individual personages that representatives of north and
south Korea meet at the earliest date in Pyong-yang, Seoul, or at Panmunjom
to negotiate about all the above issues.

There is no reason why the Koreans, one and the same nation, should not meet
together and negotiate.  Why should we, people in the north, continue to
hold talks with the Yankees about the question of our own country at
Panmunjom, a place in our own land?  Why should the south Korean people be
deprived of their seats by the Yankees?  The Yankees must pull out and
Koreans should sit together and discuss the Korean question.

All political parties, social organizations and individual personages in
south Korea should demand that the north and the south hold negotiations as
soon as possible.  All patriotic people in south Korea must struggle for
economic and cultural exchange between the north and the south, for the
reduction of the vast army of south Korea and for free north-south general
elections.

The peaceful reunification of our country can by no means be easily
achieved.  We must not forget even for a moment that the U.S. imperialists,
the ringleaders of world reaction, are occupying south Korea.  The peaceful
reunification of the country can be achieved only by a persistent struggle
of all the Korean people.

When the socialist forces are further strengthened in the northern half of
the Republic and all the patriotic forces in south Korea firmly unite and
turn out in the decisive struggle against the U.S. imperialists and their
lackeys, we will be able to drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors out of
south Korea and accomplish the great historic task of the peaceful
reunification of our country.

9 March, 02

for immediate release




The trial of community activists, Cliff and Joe Smith, arrested at the 15 
January New Brunswick Board of Education meeting, is scheduled for 20 March, 
5:30pm, in the NB Municipal Courthouse.

The activists, who have long organized for an elected school board, were 
charged with disrupting a public meeting, after Cliff Smith distributed 
copies of recent, low standardized test scores.  Joe Smith was also charged 
with two counts of simple assault.

The activists have filed their own charges of assault against High School 
Principal Pierre Embry, and Donald Bowling, who physically threw them from 
the meeting.  �The administration prefers thug tactics to cover up their 
criminal failure of New Brunswick�s youth,� said Joe Smith.  �No amount of 
arrests and intimidation will help raise these test scores.�

11th grade students scored 51% passing in the High School Proficiency Test, 
required for graduation.  This is down from 74.5% in 1999.  Lincoln School 
4th graders scored 12.5% passing their own test.  The district�s scores are 
the lowest in Middlesex County.

New Brunswick has the only un-elected Board of Education in Middlesex 
County.  The Board is instead appointed by Mayor Cahill, who is up for 
election in November.  The activists state that they are being strong-armed 
as an opening salvo in Cahill�s campaign.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>The ProLibertad Freedom campaign  urges folks to read this VERY IMPORTANT 
UPDATE ON THE FIVE CUBAN POLITICAL PRISONERS!!  Please write to them and 
send them commissary donations as well.
___________________________________________________________________

Dear friends of the five Cuban heroes:

It has been awhile since we sent out an update.
We wanted to wait until Gerardo, Antonio, Ramon,
Rene and Fernando were transferred.

The process has taken up to several weeks for them
to finally be moved.

All five brothers have been sent to separate prisons
across the country, another example of the U.S.
government's callousness, knowing that the five are
very close and it meant a great deal to them to be
together during their imprisonment in Miami.

In Miami they were able to consult collectively with
their attorneys and to see each other periodically.

The following are the new addresses of the companeros:
(Please note that Gerardo Hernandez, who used to have
the name Manuel Viramontes in Miami, is now under his
real name Gerardo Hernandez.

Please be sure and write to them as soon as you
can. In the meantime, appeals have not been filed,
as court dates have not been set yet. Several of
the attorneys will continue as their appeals counsel.
In discussions with their attorneys, they have told
us that three basic points of appeals will be followed,
for now.

They are:
1. On the court's failure to order a change of venue:
In such a politically-charged and hostile environment
as Miami, the anti-Cuba terrorist capital, it was not
possible for the court to meet one of the most basic
criteria for a "fair" trial, that of an impartial and
unbiased jury, free of pressure from right-wing forces.

2. On Gerardo's murder conspiracy conviction, the
jury agreed with the U.S. prosecutor's outrageous
claim that Gerardo had conspired with Cuba to have
the pilots (who invaded Cuban airspace Feb. 24,
1996) shot down in international waters.
That was the U.S.contention, that they were
deliberately shot down in international waters, thus
the U.S. argued against Cuba's rightful claim that it
was defending its territorial space when the "Brothers
to the Rescue" planes invaded. The jury ignored
defense witnesses from the U.S. military, who actually
showed that the planes had indeed been in Cuban
airspace.

3. On the espionage conspiracy, in which three of
the brothers were convicted. The defense will argue
in appeals that the U.S. government never proved in
the 14,000 pages of transcript and 7 months of trial,
that the companeros had engaged in espionage on the
United States. In the meantime, there is a national tour
in several U.S. cities to publicize and further build
support for the five.

Following are some
of the tour dates:
SEATTLE:
Saturday, March 9, Reception for Maggie Becker,
companera of Antonio Guerrero, and Gloria La Riva,
7:00 p.m., public meeting on the Five.
For information call Tom Warner (206) 523-1720

Speakers: Florentino Batista, Diplomat, Cuban Interests
Section, and Gloria La Riva,
Coordinator, National Committee to Free the Five
U.S.-Held Cuban Political Prisoners

MILWAUKEE:
Saturday, March 16, 2pm. Central United Methodist

DETROIT:
Sunday, March 17, 1:30-5 p.m., Swords into
Plowshares Gallery, Adams St., East of Woodward
at Grand Circus Park. Video with interviews offamily
members and discussion on how this case relates to
the current "war on terrorism"?  What is the history of
terrorist attacks against Cuba? In Detroit, call: Justice
for Cuba Coalition 313 561 8330 or 313 516 7898
E-mail: laborexchange@... .

One major focus of our work is the collection of
petitions to show wide support across the U.S. for
the five companeros. We are urging supporters to
get a copy of the petition (available on the webpage:
www.actionsf.org ) calling for George W. Bush to
free the Five. Please distribute it at political and
other public events. For example in San Francisco
and New York, activists have made it a habit to take
the petition  to many events, make an announcement
if possible, and collect signatures. We have been able
to get up to hundreds at major events. For more
information, and literature, and the new video, callus at
415-821-6545, or e-mail us at: freethefive@...

  CHALKDUST PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS "THE CRADLE WILL ROCK"

  Chalkdust Productions, Central Jersey�s newest non-profit theatre group, 
will present its inaugural production, Marc Blitzstein's The Cradle Will 
Rock at the Princeton Arts Council at the corner of Witherspoon Street and 
Paul Robeson Place on March 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 21, and 22 at 8:00pm. 
Admission is $10 for Students and Senior Citizens, $12 General Admission. 
For reservations/information visit www.chalkdustproductions.org or call 
609-430-9345.

  The Cradle Will Rock was written in 1937 originally intended to be 
presented by the WPA Theatre of the Federal Works Administration with John 
Houseman as producer and Orson Welles directing. The political opposition to 
certain ofthe administration's projects, particularly those judged to 
contain un-American themes and sentiments, the history of the show's 
premiere became almost as legendary as the performance itself; a story 
related in Tim Robbin's recent mostly factual 1999 film.

  The work is a "play with music" which allegorically relates a la Bertolt 
Brecht the advent of the labor union movement in the United States. To form 
a band of resistance against the organization of the unions in the fictional 
Steeltown USA, Mr. Mister, the wealthiest man in the community, buys the 
influence of the major town leaders to join his Liberty Committee. When the 
members of this committee are mistakenly hauled into the local nightcourt 
while observing a union rally, the story of each committee member�s �fall� 
is told in flashback. Also introduced are the local druggist whose life has 
been caught up in the activities and a young woman forced into prostitution 
by poverty.

  Blitzstein�s treatment of the politics of war, art, labor, ethics and 
human values are especially timely. This classic work of American theatre 
challenges our assumptions about our culture and shakes the roots of our 
collective subconscious.

  Cast members include Alexandra Tobia and Adam Fitting, of Princeton;
  Timothy Jones and Teresa Hui, of Westminster Choir College; Jennifer Day, 
Amy Crosby, Brianne Shurolt of Cranbury; Michelle Wynn of Somerset; Jay 
Casale of Manalapan; Anne Howe of Mantua; Keith Sampino of Old Bridge; Jay 
Brancato of Parsippany; Loreto Torres of Somerset; and Brian Bara of 
Levittown, PA. The work is directed by Theodore R. Clement of Princeton, NJ, 
with musical direction by Kenneth P. Howard of Mercerville, NJ. Stage 
management by Barbara Gianotto of East Brunswick.

Subject:Marshall Trial<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>To: New Brunswick Peoples' Campaign and Sisterhood &amp; Struggle:

From: Drena T. Carter (Mother of Corey Ashford, key witness, State v.
                       James Marshall)

8 March, 2002

I deeply regret not being able to attend your meeting today, however, due to 
the serious nature of this case, I was advised against attending.  I do 
however, would like to thank each and every one of you for your support and 
continued interest surrounding the police corruption case of Jim Marshall.

Unfortunately because I am a witness in this case, particulars cannot be 
discussed.  However, I will fill you in on facts that have been made public 
either in court, or the newspapers.  People seem to think that James 
Marshall was acquitted and are deeply confused with regards to legalities of 
this case.  It is most unfortunate that people only read the headlines and 
not between the lines especially in cases such as this one.  James Marshall 
was losing this trial by a landslide, and the only way that his attorney 
could come up for air was to drag things out to the point where the jury was 
getting restless and bored.  After six weeks of trial, only four witnesses 
had been called, one being the key witness, my son, Corey Ashford.  After 
the prosecution concluded its questioning of Corey, the defense attorney 
begun its cross examination.  However, the questions were redundant of what 
the prosecution had just finished up with.  Most would have questioned the 
line of mild questioning that the defense attorney brought to the table.  
However, we all know now that the defense attorney had a hidden agenda, and 
suddenly he was sick for a week and court was postponed only to find out 
that some of the jurors asked to be released due to prior commitments.  
Either this was a stroke of luck for the Marshall team, or a well planned 
strategy on the part of Marshall's attorney.  They say that most attorneys 
can feel the jury, and I don't think there were any connections on behalf of 
Marshall.  Marshall's attorney is rude and obnoxious, and tries to set the 
scene of the courtroom of a Perry Mason show.  However, after the tapes were 
played, the jury seemed quite interested.

After testifying, I appeared on the day my son was to testify.  Noone in the 
courtroom had a problem with my presence, with the exception of Marshall's 
attorney.  He made up the excuse that he might have to call me back as a 
witness.  However, Corey's girlfriend was also asked to leave the courtroom 
[illegible] witness to testify.  Marshall's attorney's real motive was to 
make it seem like Corey had no family support, and that he was just some 
street thug out there alone making this entire thing up, while Marshall is 
being surrounded by a loving family that has his support.

Marshall is as guilty as the day is long, however, he is determined that he 
won't go down without a fight not caring who he hurts or destroys.  His 
pride won't allow him to take a plea bargain although his attorney did 
inquire about having one on the table...  And where is he getting all this 
money for legal fees.  According to a very reliable source, Marshall's 
attorney fees have exceeded $100,000, and he still has three more trials to 
go.  I didn't realize legal cops made that kind of money, or are the 
taxpayers of New Brunswick footing the bill?

I say to you people, if Marshall walks, the struggle for justice will have 
to start from the beginning again.  Everything that you have worked for in 
demanding fair and equal treatment for mankind will be conceived as a joke.  
Don't let this happen.  If Marshall walks, so should every criminal that has 
ever been locked up for selling and distribution of illegal drugs, not to 
mention the king pin of a brothel aka whorehouse.

James Marshall has tried to destroy my family, however, we are strong and 
believe in the fight.  If we all weren't witnesses, we'd be passing out 
fliers and sitting in the courtroom just as you are.  However, we don't want 
any more excuses for mistrials and delays, so we must stay in the 
background.  We want Marshall to pay for his crime and do his time.  If 
there is justice in Middlesex County, this will happen.  However, the only 
way that justice will be served is if the good people of New Brunswick and 
the surrounding areas come forward and demand just that, justice be served.  
Stop pussyfooting with Marshall and get this nightmare over with.  How can a 
convicted felon be allowed to walk freely as we law abiding citizens do, 
leave town at his leisure and continue to manipulate the system.  Who does 
Marshall really have in his back pocket, or should I say his little black 
book.

Again, I express my deepest regrets for not physically being here, however, 
you have my full support in all that you do.  Peace and strength be with 
you.

Sincerely,

Drena T. Carter

The verdict: Al-Amin guilty of 13 counts; sentencing phase begins Monday

By STEVE VISSER and LATEEF MUNGIN

Atlanta Journal-Constitution Staff Writers A Fulton County jury Saturday 
convicted Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the Muslim cleric once known as H. Rap 
Brown, of the murder of a sheriff's deputy and the wounding of another 
nearly two years ago.
The jurors deliberated for 10 hours over two days before finding Al-Amin 
guilty of the murder of Deputy Ricky Kinchen and wounding Deputy Aldranon 
English, Kinchen's partner.
The trial now moves to a penalty phase, in which jurors will decide whether 
to recommend execution or life in prison for the 58-year-old Al-Amin. He was 
found guilty of 13 counts, including murder, aggravated assault on a police 
officer, obstruction and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
The jury will return at 10 a.m. Monday. According to the judge, the death 
penalty phase will last most of the week. The jury may recommend sentences 
of life with the possibility of parole, life without the possibility of 
parole or death by injection.
When first guilty verdict was read aloud in the court, Al-Amin's younger 
wife under Islamic practice, Amira, ran from the courtroom crying. She could 
be heard wailing from a hall. Al-Amin appeared impassive as the verdicts 
were read aloud Saturday. At one point, he turned to look at his son and his 
first wife, Karima.
After Judge Stephanie Manis announced the proceedings were done for the day, 
most in the courtroom remained calm, but one woman screamed "How long shall 
they kill our prophets? Free Jamil Al-Amin." An elderly man joined her 
protest and they were escorted from the courtroom. Al-Amin's brother, Ed 
Brown, said the family will "continue to fight and we will appeal."
"I will continue to struggle for his life," Brown said.
Members of the Kinchen family left the courtroom immediately, without 
comment.
No one at Al-Amin's mosque in West End had any comment immediately after the 
verdict.
At The Mall West End, the verdict was the subject of debate between sisters 
Cynthia and Shon Curry.
"He's not guilty," said Cynthia Curry, 28, of Decatur. "I feel it was a 
setup."
Her sister, Shon Curry, 25, who lives in the West End had a different take: 
"Why would he run if he didn't do it?"d
During the three-week trial, a key prosecution, the deputy who was wounded, 
described how he looked the gunman in the eyes and said the gunman was 
Al-Amin.
Al-Amin's defense, however, argued that inconsistencies in testimony from 
English and other prosecution witnesses showed police arrested the wrong man 
and that law enforcement officers are trying to frame Al-Amin.
They argued that when English first identified Al-Amin, the deputy's 
judgment was "contaminated" by the morphine he'd been given to ease the pain 
of his wounds. They point out that English first said the gunman's eyes were 
gray. Al-Amin's are brown.
Al-Amin's attorneys tried to throw other doubt son the prosecution's case by 
putting forth the existence of a mystery man named "Mustafa," a man one 
witness said carried a weapon into Al-Amin's mosque about an hour before the 
shooting.
Robert McBurney, the lead prosecutor, mocked the "Mustafa" theory, pointing 
out that the murder weapons ended up in Alabama, near the place Al-Amin was 
arrested.
In the mid-1960s, known for his fiery rhetoric, huge Afro and black shades, 
Brown was an outspoken leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee. By the time he joined SNCC, the group was in turmoil as its 
conciliatory founders, Julian Bond and John Lewis, were being pushed out for 
more radical leaders like Brown and Stokely Carmichael.
Although he was accused of instigating arson and riots in Maryland in 1967, 
had made the FBI's Most Wanted List and was briefly affiliated with the 
Black Panther Party, a judge was lenient on him in 1973 upon sentencing him 
to five years in prison for armed robbery and a shoot-out with New York 
police.
The possibility of Al-Amin facing a death sentence began in May 1999, when 
he was charged with theft by receiving stolen property, having no proof of 
insurance and impersonating a police officer in Cobb County.
For the 23 years prior to that 1999 charge, Al-Amin had lived a relatively 
quiet life as a spiritual leader in the West End area of Atlanta. He 
occasionally appeared in public -- he addressed the United Nations about the 
slaughter in Bosnia at once point -- and was building a national following 
as a Muslim leader. He planned to gain converts from across the United 
States and build a sprawling $47 million Islamic complex in rural Alabama.
After Al-Amin was released from custody on the Cobb County charge, he did 
not show up in court on the appointed date. He was charged with failure to 
appear. On March 16, 2000, Kinchen and English were sent to the West End to 
serve the warrant on Al-Amin.
Before that night would end, English would be shot four times - twice in the 
thigh, once in the right side and once in the upper arm. For Kinchen, it 
would be worse. An autopsy determined he was shot six times with three 
different types of ammo. A few days later, Al-Amin was arrested in the small 
town of White Hall, Ala., a town he once had hoped would be the site of his 
dream community.
Early ballistics tests showed that a Ruger assault rifle and a 9 mm 
semiautomatic pistol found nearby were the same weapons used to shoot 
Kinchen. A bullet-riddled black Mercedes-Benz, that English said Al-Amin was 
driving when they tried to arrest him - was also found on Johnson's 
property.
While in jail awaiting trial, Al-Amin claimed jailers were threatening to 
kill him. He spent much of his time in solitary confinement. He was set to 
go on trial Sept. 12, 2001. But, a day earlier, radical Muslims hi-jacked 
four airplanes, killing thousands of American. Fearing that a jury could be 
tainted by the sudden national backlash against Muslims, Al-Amin's trial was 
delayed.
Jury selection finally began on Jan. 8, 2002, and on Feb. 19, a jury of nine 
blacks, two whites and one Hispanic was picked. In picking the jury, 
attorneys questioned them about their thoughts on Islam, the police and the 
Black Panthers.
Staff writers Craig Schneider and Stacy Shelton contributed to this report.

Mr. George W. Bush
President of the United States of America
The White House
Washington, D.C.

Mr. President:  The government of the United States has committed yet 
another injustice against the people of Cuba. Five Cuban patriots were found 
guilty at a  rigged trial held in a Florida court despite the fact that 
their only crime was to defend their homeland against the criminal acts of 
anti-Cuban terrorist organizations, to protect the security and well-being 
of the Cuban people, and to save Cuban�and even American�lives.  These 
imprisoned heroes were preventing acts of terrorism against their country.  
The incarceration of Gerardo Hern�ndez Nordelo, Ram�n Laba�ino Salazar, 
Fernando Gonz�lez Llort, Ren� Gonz�lez Sehwerert, and Antonio Guerrero 
Rodr�guez is unjust and unjustified.

The undersigned men and women of Puerto Rico demand the release of these 
five Cuban heroes and of our Puerto Rican political prisoners: Oscar L�pez 
Rivera, Carlos Alberto Torres, Juan Segarra Palmer, Antonio Camacho Negr�n, 
Jos� Sol�s, and Hayd�e Beltr�n.

The verdict: Al-Amin guilty of 13 counts; sentencing phase begins Monday

By STEVE VISSER and LATEEF MUNGIN

Atlanta Journal-Constitution Staff Writers A Fulton County jury Saturday 
convicted Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the Muslim cleric once known as H. Rap 
Brown, of the murder of a sheriff's deputy and the wounding of another 
nearly two years ago.
The jurors deliberated for 10 hours over two days before finding Al-Amin 
guilty of the murder of Deputy Ricky Kinchen and wounding Deputy Aldranon 
English, Kinchen's partner.
The trial now moves to a penalty phase, in which jurors will decide whether 
to recommend execution or life in prison for the 58-year-old Al-Amin. He was 
found guilty of 13 counts, including murder, aggravated assault on a police 
officer, obstruction and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
The jury will return at 10 a.m. Monday. According to the judge, the death 
penalty phase will last most of the week. The jury may recommend sentences 
of life with the possibility of parole, life without the possibility of 
parole or death by injection.
When first guilty verdict was read aloud in the court, Al-Amin's younger 
wife under Islamic practice, Amira, ran from the courtroom crying. She could 
be heard wailing from a hall. Al-Amin appeared impassive as the verdicts 
were read aloud Saturday. At one point, he turned to look at his son and his 
first wife, Karima.
After Judge Stephanie Manis announced the proceedings were done for the day, 
most in the courtroom remained calm, but one woman screamed "How long shall 
they kill our prophets? Free Jamil Al-Amin." An elderly man joined her 
protest and they were escorted from the courtroom. Al-Amin's brother, Ed 
Brown, said the family will "continue to fight and we will appeal."
"I will continue to struggle for his life," Brown said.
Members of the Kinchen family left the courtroom immediately, without 
comment.
No one at Al-Amin's mosque in West End had any comment immediately after the 
verdict.
At The Mall West End, the verdict was the subject of debate between sisters 
Cynthia and Shon Curry.
"He's not guilty," said Cynthia Curry, 28, of Decatur. "I feel it was a 
setup."
Her sister, Shon Curry, 25, who lives in the West End had a different take: 
"Why would he run if he didn't do it?"d
During the three-week trial, a key prosecution, the deputy who was wounded, 
described how he looked the gunman in the eyes and said the gunman was 
Al-Amin.
Al-Amin's defense, however, argued that inconsistencies in testimony from 
English and other prosecution witnesses showed police arrested the wrong man 
and that law enforcement officers are trying to frame Al-Amin.
They argued that when English first identified Al-Amin, the deputy's 
judgment was "contaminated" by the morphine he'd been given to ease the pain 
of his wounds. They point out that English first said the gunman's eyes were 
gray. Al-Amin's are brown.
Al-Amin's attorneys tried to throw other doubt son the prosecution's case by 
putting forth the existence of a mystery man named "Mustafa," a man one 
witness said carried a weapon into Al-Amin's mosque about an hour before the 
shooting.
Robert McBurney, the lead prosecutor, mocked the "Mustafa" theory, pointing 
out that the murder weapons ended up in Alabama, near the place Al-Amin was 
arrested.
In the mid-1960s, known for his fiery rhetoric, huge Afro and black shades, 
Brown was an outspoken leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee. By the time he joined SNCC, the group was in turmoil as its 
conciliatory founders, Julian Bond and John Lewis, were being pushed out for 
more radical leaders like Brown and Stokely Carmichael.
Although he was accused of instigating arson and riots in Maryland in 1967, 
had made the FBI's Most Wanted List and was briefly affiliated with the 
Black Panther Party, a judge was lenient on him in 1973 upon sentencing him 
to five years in prison for armed robbery and a shoot-out with New York 
police.
The possibility of Al-Amin facing a death sentence began in May 1999, when 
he was charged with theft by receiving stolen property, having no proof of 
insurance and impersonating a police officer in Cobb County.
For the 23 years prior to that 1999 charge, Al-Amin had lived a relatively 
quiet life as a spiritual leader in the West End area of Atlanta. He 
occasionally appeared in public -- he addressed the United Nations about the 
slaughter in Bosnia at once point -- and was building a national following 
as a Muslim leader. He planned to gain converts from across the United 
States and build a sprawling $47 million Islamic complex in rural Alabama.
After Al-Amin was released from custody on the Cobb County charge, he did 
not show up in court on the appointed date. He was charged with failure to 
appear. On March 16, 2000, Kinchen and English were sent to the West End to 
serve the warrant on Al-Amin.
Before that night would end, English would be shot four times - twice in the 
thigh, once in the right side and once in the upper arm. For Kinchen, it 
would be worse. An autopsy determined he was shot six times with three 
different types of ammo. A few days later, Al-Amin was arrested in the small 
town of White Hall, Ala., a town he once had hoped would be the site of his 
dream community.
Early ballistics tests showed that a Ruger assault rifle and a 9 mm 
semiautomatic pistol found nearby were the same weapons used to shoot 
Kinchen. A bullet-riddled black Mercedes-Benz, that English said Al-Amin was 
driving when they tried to arrest him - was also found on Johnson's 
property.
While in jail awaiting trial, Al-Amin claimed jailers were threatening to 
kill him. He spent much of his time in solitary confinement. He was set to 
go on trial Sept. 12, 2001. But, a day earlier, radical Muslims hi-jacked 
four airplanes, killing thousands of American. Fearing that a jury could be 
tainted by the sudden national backlash against Muslims, Al-Amin's trial was 
delayed.
Jury selection finally began on Jan. 8, 2002, and on Feb. 19, a jury of nine 
blacks, two whites and one Hispanic was picked. In picking the jury, 
attorneys questioned them about their thoughts on Islam, the police and the 
Black Panthers.
Staff writers Craig Schneider and Stacy Shelton contributed to this report.

Mr. George W. Bush
President of the United States of America
The White House
Washington, D.C.

Mr. President:  The government of the United States has committed yet 
another injustice against the people of Cuba. Five Cuban patriots were found 
guilty at a  rigged trial held in a Florida court despite the fact that 
their only crime was to defend their homeland against the criminal acts of 
anti-Cuban terrorist organizations, to protect the security and well-being 
of the Cuban people, and to save Cuban�and even American�lives.  These 
imprisoned heroes were preventing acts of terrorism against their country.  
The incarceration of Gerardo Hern�ndez Nordelo, Ram�n Laba�ino Salazar, 
Fernando Gonz�lez Llort, Ren� Gonz�lez Sehwerert, and Antonio Guerrero 
Rodr�guez is unjust and unjustified.

The undersigned men and women of Puerto Rico demand the release of these 
five Cuban heroes and of our Puerto Rican political prisoners: Oscar L�pez 
Rivera, Carlos Alberto Torres, Juan Segarra Palmer, Antonio Camacho Negr�n, 
Jos� Sol�s, and Hayd�e Beltr�n.

Name    City

 From: Drena T. Carter (Mother of Corey Ashford, key witness, State v.
                        James Marshall)
 
 8 March, 2002
 
 I deeply regret not being able to attend your meeting today, however, due to 
 the serious nature of this case, I was advised against attending.  I do 
 however, would like to thank each and every one of you for your support and 
 continued interest surrounding the police corruption case of Jim Marshall.
 
 Unfortunately because I am a witness in this case, particulars cannot be 
 discussed.  However, I will fill you in on facts that have been made public 
 either in court, or the newspapers.  People seem to think that James 
 Marshall was acquitted and are deeply confused with regards to legalities of 
 this case.  It is most unfortunate that people only read the headlines and 
 not between the lines especially in cases such as this one.  James Marshall 
 was losing this trial by a landslide, and the only way that his attorney 
 could come up for air was to drag things out to the point where the jury was 
 getting restless and bored.  After six weeks of trial, only four witnesses 
 had been called, one being the key witness, my son, Corey Ashford.  After 
 the prosecution concluded its questioning of Corey, the defense attorney 
 begun its cross examination.  However, the questions were redundant of what 
 the prosecution had just finished up with.  Most would have questioned the 
 line of mild questioning that the defense attorney brought to the table.  
 However, we all know now that the defense attorney had a hidden agenda, and 
 suddenly he was sick for a week and court was postponed only to find out 
 that some of the jurors asked to be released due to prior commitments.  
 Either this was a stroke of luck for the Marshall team, or a well planned 
 strategy on the part of Marshall's attorney.  They say that most attorneys 
 can feel the jury, and I don't think there were any connections on behalf of 
 Marshall.  Marshall's attorney is rude and obnoxious, and tries to set the 
 scene of the courtroom of a Perry Mason show.  However, after the tapes were 
 played, the jury seemed quite interested.
 
 After testifying, I appeared on the day my son was to testify.  Noone in the 
 courtroom had a problem with my presence, with the exception of Marshall's 
 attorney.  He made up the excuse that he might have to call me back as a 
 witness.  However, Corey's girlfriend was also asked to leave the courtroom 
 [illegible] witness to testify.  Marshall's attorney's real motive was to 
 make it seem like Corey had no family support, and that he was just some 
 street thug out there alone making this entire thing up, while Marshall is 
 being surrounded by a loving family that has his support.
 
 Marshall is as guilty as the day is long, however, he is determined that he 
 won't go down without a fight not caring who he hurts or destroys.  His 
 pride won't allow him to take a plea bargain although his attorney did 
 inquire about having one on the table...  And where is he getting all this 
 money for legal fees.  According to a very reliable source, Marshall's 
 attorney fees have exceeded $100,000, and he still has three more trials to 
 go.  I didn't realize legal cops made that kind of money, or are the 
 taxpayers of New Brunswick footing the bill?
 
 I say to you people, if Marshall walks, the struggle for justice will have 
 to start from the beginning again.  Everything that you have worked for in 
 demanding fair and equal treatment for mankind will be conceived as a joke.  
 Don't let this happen.  If Marshall walks, so should every criminal that has 
 ever been locked up for selling and distribution of illegal drugs, not to 
 mention the king pin of a brothel aka whorehouse.
 
 James Marshall has tried to destroy my family, however, we are strong and 
 believe in the fight.  If we all weren't witnesses, we'd be passing out 
 fliers and sitting in the courtroom just as you are.  However, we don't want 
 any more excuses for mistrials and delays, so we must stay in the 
 background.  We want Marshall to pay for his crime and do his time.  If 
 there is justice in Middlesex County, this will happen.  However, the only 
 way that justice will be served is if the good people of New Brunswick and 
 the surrounding areas come forward and demand just that, justice be served.  
 Stop pussyfooting with Marshall and get this nightmare over with.  How can a 
 convicted felon be allowed to walk freely as we law abiding citizens do, 
 leave town at his leisure and continue to manipulate the system.  Who does 
 Marshall really have in his back pocket, or should I say his little black 
 book.
 
 Again, I express my deepest regrets for not physically being here, however, 
 you have my full support in all that you do.  Peace and strength be with 
 you.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Drena T. Carter

Subject:Response to having the NBPC convention on May 21st<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>I was rather disappointed to learn that the New Brunswick Peoples Campaign 
convention would be held on such a late date in May. Although some have 
mentioned that students are welcome and should be motivated to vote in this 
year's elections, very little has been done to avoid a major problem: by May 
21st, the vast majority of Rutgers students would have already left, either 
graduating or going back to their principal residence, which for the most 
part isn't New Brunswick.

There's no better way to lose credibility and seem tactless in efforts to 
attract students than to fail to schedule a convention that is much 
earlier--or deliberately be absolutely thoughtless. Or even to find an 
alternative venue to hold this convention for that matter. If the New 
Brunswick Public Library doesn't have space any earlier, look for another 
place. If no other place can be found for the dozen or more people that are 
going to vote, which is doubtful in a city of hundreds of blocks, set up 
polling places throughout the city in the form of outdoor and indoor ballot 
boxes in supporters' homes and in various other places. This was neither 
considered by those clumsily organizing the campaign nor even put to a vote. 
Clearly, the decision to hold the convention on May 21st was made privately, 
utterly oblivious of common sense.

Were these concerns raised at all? Of course they were. I argued on several 
occasions, including at February's general meeting of about a dozen people, 
to have the convention much earlier, preferably in late April, so that we 
could have a larger student turnout and have enough time for our candidates 
to iron out any problems that may arise before the June deadline for 
petitions. But, no, I'm afraid that isn't the case. Not only will far fewer 
students be able to attend the convention, but coverage by the Daily Targum 
has been needlessly lost, since they stop publishing in early May.

Apparently, not everyone's opinion or advice counts. Certainly not mine, and 
considering that only a couple of people are actually the ones making the 
decisions for the campaign, some people are more equal than others. Contrary 
to the claim that everyone's vote counts, only a couple of certain people 
actually choose who gets to vote and actually count.

Some can say that a decision was indeed made publicly, but considering that 
none was made at any of the meetings I've had publicly and privately with 
NBPC and that I've been the source of this research concerning campaign 
contributions and property ownership by city hall insiders and the fellow in 
charge of taking care of papers with the state Election Law Enforcement 
Commission (ELEC) and trying to attract student attention to issues 
important to the city, it's tough to imagine how I may have overlooked such 
a major meeting.

Moreover, it's been sorely overlooked that, following last year's change in 
officers which I admit I wasn't yet active with the NBPC to experience, 
whoever is supposed to be the treasurer hasn't taken care of the ELEC 
papers, which should've been filed soon after the officer change. Clearly, 
this raises questions of the competence and legitimacy behind the decisions 
being made. Finally, from my understanding, there's no record of any such 
decision to have such an inopportune date for the convention being made 
publicly.

I expect that these concerns will likely be immaturely and unprofessionally 
ignored, but I may just be a cynic at heart. I look forward to any serious 
discussion on this matter.

P.S. Considering the 2,059 votes "gained" by the NBPC in 2000, if one were 
to add up all the votes gained by the three candidates for City Council for 
the establishment (i.e., R. Recine, B. Valenti, J. Schrum), like Cliff 
conveniently had done for alternative candidates, the establishment gained 
many more votes than what's being mentioned.

  Dear Community Member,
  As you may know, Mayor James Cahill has announced his campaign for
  re-election in November, with council members, Joseph Egan and Blanquita
  Valenti. It was also reported that, as of March 1, their campaign chest
  already has over $80,000!
  Cahill won in 1998 with 3500 votes, out of 25,000 registered voters. It is
  not popular support that maintains his administration, but a tight,
  well-funded organization. Which is also what is needed to defeat him�
  The 2000 New Brunswick Peoples� Campaign council candidates took 2059 
votes,
  in our first time out. This is by far the greatest threat Cahill has 
faced.
  And we have strengthened our position in the community since then. But we
  need your help to win! Contributions can be made to: New Brunswick 
Peoples�
  Campaign, c/o 39 Throop Ave. #1, New Brunswick, NJ 08901. Individual
  contributions may not exceed $2200.
  Petitions for candidates are due June 4. We will hold an 
open-to-the-public
  Peoples� Convention, to democratically nominate and elect our Peoples�
  Candidates, on Tuesday, May 21, 5:00-9:00pm, NB Public Library. Everyone�s
  vote counts!
  Then we must mobilize a massive, grassroots, voter registration and
  education drive. This will include petitioning for the Elected School 
Board
  Referendum question. We must also organize social and cultural events to
  motivate and drive our campaign.
  We are in immediate need of a central office, office supplies, volunteers,
  and $$$!
  Put the word out. The city�s gonna change hands.

may 21 is the 1st available day at the library, which is the only public 
space accessible as of now.  until another opportunity presents itself, we 
must work with what we have.

a central location is necessary, in my view, to the convention to allow 
candidates to be heard.

while the community needs student involvement, it must be recognized that 
students are largely transient and temporary residents, and that the 
interests and concerns of permanent residents must take priority.

lastly, most off-campus students will still be around on may 21. &amp; they are 
the generally the ones with the greatest interest in city politics, as 
opposed to those in dormitories.

your concens and contributions are much appreciated.

&gt;Subject: [nbpc] Response to having the NBPC convention on May 21st
&gt;Date: Tue, 12 Mar 2002 11:22:51 -0500
&gt;
&gt;I was rather disappointed to learn that the New Brunswick Peoples Campaign
&gt;convention would be held on such a late date in May. Although some have
&gt;mentioned that students are welcome and should be motivated to vote in this
&gt;year's elections, very little has been done to avoid a major problem: by 
&gt;May
&gt;21st, the vast majority of Rutgers students would have already left, either
&gt;graduating or going back to their principal residence, which for the most
&gt;part isn't New Brunswick.
&gt;
&gt;There's no better way to lose credibility and seem tactless in efforts to
&gt;attract students than to fail to schedule a convention that is much
&gt;earlier--or deliberately be absolutely thoughtless. Or even to find an
&gt;alternative venue to hold this convention for that matter. If the New
&gt;Brunswick Public Library doesn't have space any earlier, look for another
&gt;place. If no other place can be found for the dozen or more people that are
&gt;going to vote, which is doubtful in a city of hundreds of blocks, set up
&gt;polling places throughout the city in the form of outdoor and indoor ballot
&gt;boxes in supporters' homes and in various other places. This was neither
&gt;considered by those clumsily organizing the campaign nor even put to a 
&gt;vote.
&gt;Clearly, the decision to hold the convention on May 21st was made 
&gt;privately,
&gt;utterly oblivious of common sense.
&gt;
&gt;Were these concerns raised at all? Of course they were. I argued on several
&gt;occasions, including at February's general meeting of about a dozen people,
&gt;to have the convention much earlier, preferably in late April, so that we
&gt;could have a larger student turnout and have enough time for our candidates
&gt;to iron out any problems that may arise before the June deadline for
&gt;petitions. But, no, I'm afraid that isn't the case. Not only will far fewer
&gt;students be able to attend the convention, but coverage by the Daily Targum
&gt;has been needlessly lost, since they stop publishing in early May.
&gt;
&gt;Apparently, not everyone's opinion or advice counts. Certainly not mine, 
&gt;and
&gt;considering that only a couple of people are actually the ones making the
&gt;decisions for the campaign, some people are more equal than others. 
&gt;Contrary
&gt;to the claim that everyone's vote counts, only a couple of certain people
&gt;actually choose who gets to vote and actually count.
&gt;
&gt;Some can say that a decision was indeed made publicly, but considering that
&gt;none was made at any of the meetings I've had publicly and privately with
&gt;NBPC and that I've been the source of this research concerning campaign
&gt;contributions and property ownership by city hall insiders and the fellow 
&gt;in
&gt;charge of taking care of papers with the state Election Law Enforcement
&gt;Commission (ELEC) and trying to attract student attention to issues
&gt;important to the city, it's tough to imagine how I may have overlooked such
&gt;a major meeting.
&gt;
&gt;Moreover, it's been sorely overlooked that, following last year's change in
&gt;officers which I admit I wasn't yet active with the NBPC to experience,
&gt;whoever is supposed to be the treasurer hasn't taken care of the ELEC
&gt;papers, which should've been filed soon after the officer change. Clearly,
&gt;this raises questions of the competence and legitimacy behind the decisions
&gt;being made. Finally, from my understanding, there's no record of any such
&gt;decision to have such an inopportune date for the convention being made
&gt;publicly.
&gt;
&gt;I expect that these concerns will likely be immaturely and unprofessionally
&gt;ignored, but I may just be a cynic at heart. I look forward to any serious
&gt;discussion on this matter.

&gt;
&gt;P.S. Considering the 2,059 votes "gained" by the NBPC in 2000, if one were
&gt;to add up all the votes gained by the three candidates for City Council for
&gt;the establishment (i.e., R. Recine, B. Valenti, J. Schrum), like Cliff
&gt;conveniently had done for alternative candidates, the establishment gained
&gt;many more votes than what's being mentioned.

&gt;   Dear Community Member,
&gt;   As you may know, Mayor James Cahill has announced his campaign for
&gt;   re-election in November, with council members, Joseph Egan and Blanquita
&gt;   Valenti. It was also reported that, as of March 1, their campaign chest
&gt;   already has over $80,000!
&gt;   Cahill won in 1998 with 3500 votes, out of 25,000 registered voters. It 
&gt;is
&gt;   not popular support that maintains his administration, but a tight,
&gt;   well-funded organization. Which is also what is needed to defeat him�
&gt;   The 2000 New Brunswick Peoples� Campaign council candidates took 2059
&gt;votes,
&gt;   in our first time out. This is by far the greatest threat Cahill has
&gt;faced.
&gt;   And we have strengthened our position in the community since then. But 
&gt;we
&gt;   need your help to win! Contributions can be made to: New Brunswick
&gt;Peoples�
&gt;   Campaign, c/o 39 Throop Ave. #1, New Brunswick, NJ 08901. Individual
&gt;   contributions may not exceed $2200.
&gt;   Petitions for candidates are due June 4. We will hold an
&gt;open-to-the-public
&gt;   Peoples� Convention, to democratically nominate and elect our Peoples�
&gt;   Candidates, on Tuesday, May 21, 5:00-9:00pm, NB Public Library. 
&gt;Everyone�s
&gt;   vote counts!
&gt;   Then we must mobilize a massive, grassroots, voter registration and
&gt;   education drive. This will include petitioning for the Elected School
&gt;Board
&gt;   Referendum question. We must also organize social and cultural events to
&gt;   motivate and drive our campaign.
&gt;   We are in immediate need of a central office, office supplies, 
&gt;volunteers,
&gt;   and $$$!
&gt;   Put the word out. The city�s gonna change hands.

<pre>To be fair, no, I wasn't silenced.

However, once again, I was never present at any vote whereby an April 
convention was considered. Moreover, as it was aptly and so clearly 
mentioned time and again, most notably during the February general 
meeting, Republicans don't have a voting say. As a reminder, I myself 
am a registered Republican and, for the most part, being railroaded 
into re-registering as something different in order to have a voting 
say in a process that's supposed to be democratic is not only 
unethical but just plain obnoxious.

Concerning an April convention, when I first met Joe at Cafe 52 
sometime in mid-December, we discussed a number of things, including 
the scheduling of the convention. Even at that point in time, I most 
vociferously argued to have the convention held in April.

Also, I've decided to contact a number of places throughout New 
Brunswick concerning open spaces.

Why can't there be extra effort made to hold a convention over a

an attempt to reserve space at the public library for April as early

<pre>everyone was encouraged to locate available, accessible venues for the 
convention.  no one came back w/ any. including you, sash. what places did 
you look into prior to our mtg? none that you spoke of until just now.  what 
is your great opposition to the library 21 may?

i sought the public library &amp; the public schools, the only free, public 
spaces i am aware of. the library is booked thru april w/ a george 
washington exhibit. the schools are not favorable to political events.

the library is more central &amp; recognizable to the community than are campus 
centers. &amp; there is no cost. the community must take precedence, w/o 
diminishing the need for student involvement and representation. it is the 
students who must take the step into the community. further, the vast 
majority of peoples' campaign supporters and participants have come from the 
community.

if we do our jobs, we shd expect more than 60 people.  there is no reason to 
expect that a second day wd significantly increase turnout. rather, it is 
giving ourselves until the end of may to organize, instead of april, which 
will increase turnout, if this is your actual concern.

why shd it be alarming that republican party members are restricted in the 
peoples' campaign?  can i vote at the republican convention?  the republican 
party operates 'democratically' among its members. we are have the same 
prerogative, and are independent of the corporate republican and democratic 
parties. everyone makes their own free choice as to their party allegiance. 
why complain?

<pre>Cliff, perhaps your memory is as faulty as your intelligence. Need I 
remind you that I raised the issue of having the convention earlier 
back in late December? Are you that much of a twit that you weren't 
even paying attention?

And, interestingly enough, you still haven't answered my earlier 
questions. You answer my question about what other venues were looked 
into with another question. In addition, your claim that I had 
nothing before the March meeting is an outright lie. 

Now, it's interesting that you refer to students as transients and 
imply that students aren't actually part of the community. Well, 
considering that students do have many other things to do than just 
follow your whims and edicts, deliberately making it difficult or 
simply being so incompetent as to have much lower student turnout 
doesn't exactly encourage them to be part of the community, now does 
it?

In other words, if it were made easier for students to participate, 
then they would be more likely to be part of the community. Surely, 
Cliff, even you could understand that.

Furthermore, the issues that are salient and important to the 
community also impact students, or have you already forgotten this? 
By describing students as "transients"--even though most are in New 
Brunswick for four years or more--you deliberately distinguish them 
from the rest of the community or make absolutely no extra effort to 
increase student turnout.

Noone can deny that students have class schedules. And noone can deny 
that students need to work to pay for school and other things. But, 
apparently, in not making an extra effort to increase student turnout 
and encourage participation, this has fallen deaf on Cliff's ears.

What could've been done? I don't argue with having the convention at 
the library. I do argue, however, that the convention should've 
included something oncampus and, at least for this oncampus aspect, 
been held earlier. Alternative venues were NOT looked into by the 
NBPC leadership (which doesn't include me and most others, save for 
Cliff). However, in doing Cliff's job, I found out what a room for 60 
would cost oncampus for four hours: only about $100. I would suggest 
that, rather than getting constantly arrested, Cliff should save some 
of his money and pool it together with several others to pay for this 
room. Unfortunately, because of ineptness, this wasn't even realized.

&gt; 
&gt; i sought the public library &amp; the public schools, the only free,

&gt; 
&gt; the library is more central &amp; recognizable to the community than 
are campus

w/o 
&gt; diminishing the need for student involvement and representation. it 
is the

from the

&gt; 
&gt; if we do our jobs, we shd expect more than 60 people.  there is no 
reason to

it is 
&gt; giving ourselves until the end of may to organize, instead of 
april, which 
&gt; will increase turnout, if this is your actual concern.
&gt; 
&gt; why shd it be alarming that republican party members are restricted 
in the

republican

same 
&gt; prerogative, and are independent of the corporate republican and 
democratic 
&gt; parties. everyone makes their own free choice as to their party 
allegiance. 
&gt; why complain?

&gt; 
&gt; Out of curiousity, what places have been looked into in terms of
&gt; holding the convention elsewhere? Or was the New Brunswick Public
&gt; Library the only place that was actually considered?
&gt; 
&gt; Moreover, what's the problem with holding the convention over a 
period
&gt; of two days and in two or three locations, rather than limit
&gt; participation to one four-hour session? I called the reservations
&gt; offices for Douglass and College Avenue campuses and discovered that
&gt; costs would be remarkably low between $50 and $300. In addition, 
rooms
&gt; are in fact available for meetings of upwards of 60 people at the 
same
&gt; time.
&gt; 
&gt; I recall raising the issue of holding an April convention as early 
as
&gt; late December. Yet, noone has responded to this, aside from claims
&gt; that there's absolutely no other space available--even when I
&gt; suggested the idea four months earlier.
&gt; 
&gt; Why can't there be extra effort made to hold a convention over a
&gt; longer period of time in order to increase turnout? Why wasn't there
&gt; an attempt to reserve space at the public library for April as early
&gt; as January and February?

Subject:nb activists trial today, open to the public<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>                     The trial of community activists, Cliff and Joe Smith, 
arrested at the 15 January New Brunswick Board of Education meeting, is 
scheduled for 20 March, 5:30pm, in the NB Municipal Courthouse.

                     The activists, who have long organized for an elected 
school board, were charged with disrupting a public meeting, after Cliff 
Smith distributed copies of recent, low standardized test scores. Joe Smith 
was also charged with two counts of simple assault.

                     The activists have filed their own charges of assault 
against High School Principal Pierre Embry, and Donald Bowling, who 
physically threw them from the meeting. �The administration prefers thug 
tactics to cover up their criminal failure of New Brunswick�s youth,� said 
Joe Smith. �No amount of arrests and intimidation will help raise these test 
scores.�

                     11th grade students scored 51% passing in the High 
School Proficiency Test, required for graduation. This is down from 74.5% in 
1999. Lincoln School 4th graders scored 12.5% passing their own test. The 
district�s scores are the lowest in Middlesex County.

                     New Brunswick has the only un-elected Board of 
Education in Middlesex County. The Board is instead appointed by Mayor 
Cahill, who is up for election in November. The activists state that they 
are being strong-armed as an opening salvo in Cahill�s campaign.

Long Live the Republic!
Down with the assassins!

This is what Bol�var M�rquez, a young Puerto Rican
Nationalist wrote with his own blood on the pavement
as he laid dying on Palm Sunday, March 21st of 1937, a
day which will be remembered in our history as the
date of the cruelest act committed by the US invaders
in Puerto Rico. Bol�var M�rquez passed onto eternity
along with over 20 other Puerto Rican patriots who
were assassinated in the southern town of Ponce during
a peaceful demonstration organized by the Nationalist
Party in the city of Ponce where the Cadets of the
Republic (Cadetes de la Rep�blica) and the Daughters
of Liberty (Hijas de la Libertad) gathered to march.

Once more the local police force served as the murder
weapon of the colonial oppressor. The police
indiscriminately opened fire on a group of
Nationalists who were about to begin the peaceful
march demanding the release of Puerto Rican political
prisoners, including Albizu Campos. This tragic act is
known as La Masacre de Ponce (the Ponce Massacre).
Alongside the fallen martyrs, 150 men, women, and
children were injured by machinegun fire.

"La independencia requiere, como todo supremo bien, el
sacrificio de todo lo m�s sabio, noble y puro de la
nacionalidad."

"Independence requires, as does every supreme good,
the sacrifice of all that is most wise, noble and pure
of nationality."

Don Pedro Albizu Campos

During that ten minute shooting at the Ponce Massacre,
the flag-bearer of the Cadets of the Republic was
killed. Carmen Fern�ndez then tried to take the flag
herself when she saw the flag-bearer fall, she was
shot and gravely injured. At that point, Dominga Cruz
Bacerril, a lady from Mayag�ez who had already taken
cover, saw the flag fall on the pavement. She ran up
to the flag, picked it up, waved it and then ran with
it towards a close by hospital without being harmed.
When asked why she exposed herself to such danger, she
calmly answered: "El Maestro has told us that the flag
must always be raised up high." "The Teacher" she
referred to was Don Pedro Albizu Campos.

As it is evident in the photographs taken by a
journalist, the members of the Nationalist Party and
the Cadets of the Republic ("black shirts") were
unarmed and trapped by the police who shot them at
close range. This crime was committed under direct
orders of General Winship, the colonial governor of
the island at the time. After this act of terrorism by
the colonial government, the imprisoned Nationalist
leaders were transferred to Atlanta.

A year later Winship was executed by a team of
Nationalists when  he returned to Ponce to celebrate
another anniversary of the US invasion.  Angel Esteban
Antongiorgi one of the members of the commando, fired
his weapon until he ran out of bullets before being
killed by a police officer.

               Published in the Home News Tribune 03/25/02


               Is Marshall getting favored treatment?

               Convicted criminal and former New Brunswick narcotics 
detective James Marshall must face the court as any other member of the
community. His defense strategy of stall and evade must be put to rest.

               Enjoying free-on-appeal status from his four-year brothel 
sentence, Marshall sought, at his March 11 hearing, to postpone his 
drug-running charges until September, after the anticipated retirement of 
Judge Barnett Hoffman. Further, he attempts to remove his
case from the scene of the crime, to a court outside Middlesex County.  He 
still faces three more trials.

               Why does Marshall get favored treatment? Who is afraid of 
Marshall's conviction? Who was the clientele in his Paterson Street
brothel, across the street from the Middlesex County Administration 
Building? Who was a partner in its operation? Why has the New Brunswick 
Police Department not retracted its false suspect profile of a "young Black 
male" in the fake Marshall/Chinchilla retirement-scheme shooting at Remsen 
and Baldwin in 1998 and apologized for the $10,000 reward, which endangered 
the safety of every black youth in the city?

               Why was Carolyn Adams killed? And how did New Brunswick 
police officer Kenny Ford die? When Mayor James Cahill took the stand as a 
character witness for Marshall and Marco Chinchilla was he a liar or a fool? 
The people want answers.

you met me @ your visit to rutgers - the "vote mcgreevey" poster with 
"Outlaw White Supremacy" on the back. We successfully stood up to the far 
right-wing during the election '01 &amp; we must double our efforts with all the 
resources the governor's office has.

from your position a proper alliance with the people can help "root out" 
this state run terrorism - racist profiling; National Oppression! (biggest 
terror aggressions in usa are sexual oppression, national oppression, 
economic oppression)

OPEN ALL FILES ON POLICE  -
STATE, LOCAL, &amp; NATIONAL!
democracy!

and while we're talking, i suggest you join the lawsuit with the woman suing 
the companies that profited from slavery, go after all the Imperial Masters, 
&amp; get our cities our fullest Abbott resources!

the new jersey independent forces currently cannot win a campaign for 
governor, but we can swing a primary to defeat the far right democrat.

&gt;URGENT ACTION!   MUST ACT ON THIS BY APRIL 20TH ! ! !
&gt;
&gt;NJ is now proposing regulation that would make the records
&gt;of the State Troopers confidential information that the public
&gt;would not be able to access!  This is just another step
&gt;to protect the police and one more step toward making
&gt;NJ a police state!
&gt;
&gt;In light of all that documentation that has come out about
&gt;racial profiling, this is an insult to the integrity of all justice
&gt;seeking people and human rights activists.
&gt;
&gt;They are taking public comment on this issue until April 20th.
&gt;So it is imperative that we act NOW!
&gt;
&gt;We must call, write and e-mail to stop this from happening!
&gt;
&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE call Governor James McGreevey
&gt;now at (609)292-6000 and demand that these records remain opened
&gt;to the public!
&gt;Please also e-mail him at www.state.nj.us/governor/govmail.html
&gt;
&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE call Attorney General David Samson
&gt;at (609)292-4925.
&gt;Please also e-mail him at citizens.services@...
&gt;
&gt;Below is a form letter that can be mailed.  Simply

&gt;Governor's address is listed on the letter.
&gt;
&gt;AND PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE PASS THIS ON!
&gt;IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN NEW JERSEY, PLEASE PASS
&gt;THIS ON TO THOSE WHO  DO!
&gt;
&gt;And if you can print out copies of the letter and get
&gt;others to sign and mail it, please do so.

&gt;
&gt;I am against sealing state troopers records and demand that these records 
&gt;be
&gt;kept opened to the public!
&gt;
&gt;It is  appalling that after all of the proof that has come to the fore 
&gt;about
&gt;State Trooper misconduct and racial profiling, that the strongest action 
&gt;that
&gt;the State is now seeking pertaining to this issue is to further protect the
&gt;Troopers by sealing their records from the public!    In light of the
&gt;Troopers  horrific and racists patterns, the proposal to seal the state
&gt;troopers record from the public is an affront to the intelligence of the
&gt;citizenry of this state, especially members of the Black and Latinos
&gt;communities.
&gt;
&gt;We are a Republic, which means for the people and by the people.   The 
&gt;people
&gt;pay the salaries of the troopers and the people have a right to have access
&gt;to information pertaining to their job performance!   State Troopers are
&gt;public employees that are employed by the State.!  And they, along with 
&gt;every
&gt;other state employee, are accountable to the people of the state in which
&gt;they work!  And as part of that accountability,  we the people have a right
&gt;to review their records as it relates to their public employment.   This is
&gt;especially important when it comes to those who we hold responsible for
&gt;ensuring public safety, (i.e. the troopers) since any negativity associated
&gt;with their performance can have serious consequences on our society.
&gt;
&gt;We will not allow the continuous erosion of our civil rights ! ! !  Sealing
&gt;these records is one more step toward making New Jersey an outright police
&gt;state.   And I reiterate my demand to keep the records of the state 
&gt;troopers
&gt;opened to the public!

UNTIL FREEDOM IS WON!
UPDATE ON THE PELTIER CAMPAIGN FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE

INCLUDED IN THIS MESSAGE:
Updates on the Motion to Reduce Leonard's Sentence, Progress Made Toward
Obtaining New Evidence, Civil Rights Case, Government Reform Committee

Dear Friends,

We are writing today with both good and bad news on the case of Leonard
Peltier.  But before we begin we want to thank all of you who have been
sponsoring LPDC speakers and organizing Peltier events in your communities.
Raising awareness continues to be essential and supporters have organized
several successful events.   Let's keep the LPDC speakers bureau busy and
word of Leonard's case flowing!  We also want to let you know that there
will be three important events on June 26 marking 27 years since the
shoot-out occurred.  They include gatherings in Oglala, South Dakota, San
Francisco, California and Boston, Massachusetts.  We encourage you to plan
on attending one of these events or organizing something in your community.
More details will be released soon.

BAD NEWS, BUT NOT SURPRISING
We regret to announce that the motion to reduce Leonard's sentence was
denied by the U.S. District Court of North Dakota.  We expected this case to
be a challenge because of the many procedural obstacles it involved combined
with the political nature of the Peltier case, especially in this district.
However, we had hoped for more fairness given that Judge Benson, who tried
Leonard, is no longer hearing cases.

Judge Magnison denied the motion without a hearing based upon issues of
timeliness.  A motion to reduce sentence is supposed to be filed within a
year following a conviction.  However, we argued that filing at this late
date was justified because of significant developments that occurred since
trial, citing cases in which exceptions had been made due to extraordinary
circumstances.  The court said that the significant developments in question
(government admission that it can't prove who shot agents/ballistics) had
already been litigated.  Judge Magnison refused to consider these issues
despite the clearly different character of the case, which sought a review
of sentence and not a new trial like before. Attorney Eric Seitz is
appealing the decision to the Eighth Circuit.

NOW WHAT?
We MUST obtain new evidence and demand a new trial for Leonard Peltier.  We
are confident that key evidence exists in the thousands of documents that
are withheld by the FBI and fortunately, we are moving closer to obtaining
them.

GOOD NEWS!
Thanks to the persistent letters of supporters in Massachusetts,
Representative Barney Frank wrote to the FBI insisting that the withheld
documents be released given Clinton's Executive Order requiring the
disclosure of documents after the passage of 25 years.  The FBI Office of
Public and Congressional Affairs responded by saying, "After receipt of your
letter.the FBI consulted with the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) to request that the investigative records pertaining
to Mr. Peltier that are 25 years or older be considered of significant
historical interest subject to declassification review.  NARA agreed and the
process of declassification review has begun.  Upon completion, the material
will be accessioned to NARA and a declassified copy will be provided to your
office.  We anticipate completion of this project by the end of the year."
Attorney Mike Kuzma, who is handling Leonard's FOIA requests, wrote to NARA
to learn when the declassification would be completed.  Mike also asked that
he be provided copies of the documents.  NARA responded, "We have been
informed that the records are still in the physical and legal custody of the
FBI.  The FBI has completed its declassification review and is currently
processing the records for transfer to NARA and their subsequent public
release.  The transfer is expected to occur in May of this year.  Following
the transfer, NARA may require additional time to prepare for the public
release of the records."  This is a very positive development for us and
strengthens our chances for obtaining new information.  Furthermore, the
documents are now protected against destruction because of their historical
classification.  The battle is not over, as we expect the documents to be
partly censored for reasons of "national security" like before.  But, we
plan to demand the full release and exposure of the documents in court.

It should also be noted that Mike Kuzma continues to pursue the documents
through the Freedom of Information Act process.  Requests have been
submitted to FBI headquarters and numerous field offices across the country.
With the exception of Portland, Oregon, all offices have reported that they
possess records.  We anticipate filing one or several suits to demand the
release of these documents in the near future.  Mike Kuzma is also working
with law students involved in the Innocence Project of Osgoode Hall and the
LPDC of Canada to obtain documents generated around the extradition.

MORE GOOD NEWS!
The civil rights complaint against the FBI has been drafted and the
finishing touches are being added now.   This case argues that the FBI
violated Leonard's Constitutional Rights by lying to the Department of
Justice, former President Clinton, the Parole Commission, and the public
with the sole intention of denying Leonard fair clemency and parole reviews,
thus costing him his long deserved freedom.  We plan to do a major press
blitz on the day the case is filed and we will need your participation.
This is our chance to undo much of the disinformation disseminated by the
FBI through the press in recent years.  Please be prepared to forward the
press release to your local media.  We will let you know when we determine
the exact date it will be filed.  Please stay tuned.

NOTE:  This case represents another opportunity to access the withheld FBI
documents through discovery.

KEEP PUSHING CONGRESS FOR INVESTIGATIONS!
Meanwhile, a window of opportunity continues to exist with the House
Committee on Government Reform.  As you know this committee is planning to
investigate cases of FBI misconduct leading to wrongful convictions.  We
must press the Reform Committee to shine its spot light on Leonard's case.
Please continue to write Representative Burton on a regular basis, and cc
your letters to your representative. A recent phone call to Rep Burton's
office indicates that he is collecting and taking notice of our letters.
Please send us copies of any response letters you receive from officials so
that we can track their positions.

LET US KNOW
Let us know if you are organizing anything for Leonard whether it be for
June 26 or any other date so that we can help by publicizing it. Do not
hesitate to contact us to share your ideas and suggestions about building
pressure and awareness for the freedom of Leonard Peltier!

Thank you.

In Solidarity,
LPDC

<pre>FORUM ON RACIST PROFILING

THURSDAY APRIL 4TH 7:30PM
DOUGLASS COLLEGE CENTER, NJC LOUNGE (2nd FLOOR)

"The War at Home"

A Community Activist Perspective

April 4th 2002 will mark the 34th anniversary of the assassination of Martin
Luther King Jr. To commemorate this event, the Community Empowerment Project
(CEP) will hold a forum on the ongoing struggle against racist profiling in
the US and specifically in New Jersey. The featured speakers are local
Afro-American grassroots community leaders currently investigating civil
rights violations with the help of Rutgers students interning with the CEP's
Civil Rights Legal Defense Program.

Featured Speakers:

VICKIE WHITE

Chairwoman of 'Southside Pride'
(Highland Park)

Southside Pride, a grassroots community organization, is investigating
widespread violations of civil rights in Highland Park after Neo-Nazi
skinheads repeatedly attacked Afro-American youth and allegedly avoided
prosecution for months due to family connections in the local government.

LINDA ANDERSON

Chairwoman of 'About Face'
(Franklin)

About Face, a grassroots community organization, is investigating the
potential wrongful conviction of Herman Gaines, a young Afro-American father
who was convicted of manslaughter solely based on the testimony of four
witnesses allegedly coerced to give false statements by Franklin police.

Sponsored by the Douglass College Government Association, Women's Defense
Coalition and the Student Action Union.

The Civil Rights Legal Defense Program is an initiative of the Community
Empowerment Project (CEP). The CEP is a registered non-profit, non-partisan
organization dedicated to the promotion of democracy and the empowerment of
local communities through progressive legal, political, cultural and social
programs.

Subject:Nike Wages: Educating For Justice, April 18<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>On Thursday, April 18th, at 7pm in the Labor Education Center
Auditorium, Jim Keady and Leslie Kretzu of Educating for Justice will be
presenting a multi media presentation on Corporate Accountability,
specifically
Nike's exploitative labor practices in Indonesia. Jim Keady was a soccer
coach at St. Johns University until he spoke out against the university's
contracts with Nike and was fired. Leslie Kretzu, a former track star,
recently helped carry the Olympic torch across the country to Salt Lake
City.
During her leg of the tour, she ran barefoot through the icy streets of
Philadelphia to demonstrate her solidarity with Nike workers. In 2000, Jim
and
Leslie spent several weeks living in Indonesia on the same amount of money
as
that paid to Nike subcontractors.

Part of the proceeds generated by Educating for Justice's speaking
tour will go towards funding the establishment of an Education and Resource
Center in Tangerang, Indonesia. In the future, Educating For Justice will
give students the opportunity to visit and/or teach at the Education and
Research Center.

Please, also note that EFJ currently has two openings for interns in their
Belmar, NJ office.

If you would like more info about the presentation, please visit
www.nikewages.org

Or contact Christine Mingolla at 212-532-1319 or  cmingolla@....

Association.

!!!!from the new brunswick peoples campaign - Win the Elected Board of Ed. 
Nov2002!!!!

defeating racist profiling &amp; underfunded, segregated NB schools - that lack 
a democratically elected board of education - are very similar struggles. 
both are offsprings of US Imperialism's white supremacist relationship to 
oppressed nations, and both will be defeated simotaneously with the 
democratic struggle for self-determination. the new brunswick peoples 
campaign would like to reach out to CEP in an effort to build a democratic 
united front against US Imperialism that will organize locally aroud the 
issue of Peoples Democracy.

FYI
new brunswick activists struggling to win the elected board of education 
would like to make CEP aware of the court case involving ourselves v. NB 
high school principal Pierre Embrey, Community Relations for NB police agent 
Donald Bowling. activist Cliff Smith is being charged w/disrupting a public 
meeting &amp; Joe Smith is being charged w/disrupting a public meeting &amp; 2 
counts of simple assault. Embrey &amp; Bowling are being charged w/assault by 
each activist. this is a very serious case for any groups or individuals 
looking to freely organize in NB without the threat of attacks from city 
officials who very livelyhoods are threatened by our organizing.

the activists case will resume april 19 @10:00am
for more information contact joe smith 732.296.7172 or 973.485.6280

<pre>People's Campaign --

You assume one occurrence excludes the other and that one occurrence is more
important than the other for the people to be served by both occurrences.

A question you imply is: What is the hierarchy of priorities for the
greatest good for those in greatest need? How ought we to best distribute
our time, energy, and resources? Are the various life-saving bills in the
state legislature and other C4J Demands worth our support and pressuring for
greater specificity and effectiveness? How much support you ask? Good
question. When we're not marching in Trenton ought we, as individuals, be
funding, marching, educating, etc in Newark to aid in Ras' election?

 Two new C4J demands are in the areas of statewide public school education
and fair assignment of statewide government construction contracts to
minority group construction companies and hiring of minority group labor.
Are you folks on board?

Please ask Tracey to keep us posted on upcoming events and efforts. We'll
keep you advised thru this poprogress list regarding our C4J Demands and
efforts, and POP's efforts as well.

NATIVE AMERICAN ACTIVIST FILES LAWSUIT AGAINST FBI

        Former FBI Director Louis Freeh is named as a defendant in a lawsuit
filed today by attorneys for imprisoned Native American activist, Leonard
Peltier.  Freeh, along with the FBI Agents Association and a long list of
active FBI agents, are accused of violating Peltier's Constitutional rights
by making false and unsupported statements to the public, the Department of
Justice, the United States Parole Commission, and former President Clinton.
The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court, Washington D.C., alleges that
the FBI "engaged in a systematic, and officially sanctioned campaign of
mis-information and dis-information" designed to prevent Peltier from
receiving fair clemency and parole reviews.

            The suit follows a highly controversial campaign conducted by
the FBI to stop former president Bill Clinton from issuing Peltier a grant
of executive clemency during his last days in office.  FBI agents across the
nation submitted letters to the editor, sponsored major newspaper and radio
ads, and marched by the hundreds in front of the White House to discourage
clemency.  Former FBI Director Louis Freeh wrote searing letters to Bill
Clinton and Janet Reno, to urge against Peltier's release.  The campaign,
which gained national attention, characterized Peltier as a cold-blooded
killer who brutally shot two FBI agents at point blank range.  Peltier's
attorneys and supporters assert that this characterization is not only false
but intentionally deceptive given the government's long held position that
it cannot prove who shot the agents.  Furthermore, they say it cost Peltier,
now 57 years of age and in poor health, his long deserved freedom.

            Peltier has served more than 26 years in prison for the deaths
of two FBI agents killed in a 1975 shoot-out on the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation.  Peltier's supporters claim the FBI terrorized witnesses,
utilized false testimony and withheld a ballistic test proving Peltier's
innocence to gain his conviction.  Senior Eighth Circuit Judge Gerald
Heaney, who denied Peltier a new trial based on a legal technicality, has
since come forward to support Peltier's release, citing FBI misconduct.
Amnesty International, the Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights, Rev.
Jesse Jackson, Rigoberta Menchu Tum, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Corretta Scott
King, and scores of Native tribes are among those who consider Peltier a
political prisoner who should be freed.

(Complaint will be posted on LPDC web site on April 4: www.freepeltier.org .
Interviews with lawyer handling case and spokespeople for the LPDC can 
bearranged).

Demand Accountability from the INS!

Tell McElroy to Meet the Public!

Since September 11, the INS and FBI have detained over 1,200 
immigrants,mainly of Arab or South Asian origin. And much of this is taking 
place inour own back yard.Brooklyn communities have been one of the INS' 
main targets.  Hundreds ofArab, Pakistani, and Muslim community members have 
been disappeared fromConey Island, Midwood, Bay Ridge, and other 
neighborhoods in the middle ofthe night by the FBI and INS.  Six months 
later, most of their loved onesare still being kept in the dark about their 
charges and conditions.  Andour communities are living in fear.Yet, the INS 
has not been held accountable for its actions in ourcommunities!Moreover, 
the District Director of the INS for New York, Edward McElroy, hasrefused to 
respond to repeated public requests for a town meeting.  Yet, hiscounterpart 
in New Jersey, Andrea Quarantillo, has agreed to meet the publicand begin a 
process of creating transparency.  That meeting is now beingscheduled.This 
is why the campaign to Stop the Disappearances! is asking for 
yourinvolvement to let McElroy know that our communities are seeking answers 
andthat he must be accountable to the communities he serves.****Join dozens 
of other organizations and individuals who havealready joined this effort to 
put pressure on McElroy &amp; the INS to     stopoperating under secrecy.  Write 
a letter as an individual or     from yourorganization seeking a public 
community meeting with        Edward McElroyin

Dear Mr. McElroy,We write this letter to you as member of the community 
organization_____________, representing constituencies concerned by the mass 
detentionsof immigrants since September 11th, 2001.Over the past several 
months, we have been watching as it is brought tolight the unjust 
circumstances under which our and others' loved ones havebeen arrested and 
detained.  The families of those detained are simplyasking that due process, 
which is guaranteed for all under the United StatesConstitution, be 
respected for their loved ones.  We support them stronglyin this, and ask 
you to agree to a public meeting over these detentions inNew York.Ms. Andrea 
Quarantillo, District Director of the Newark regional INS, andMr. Jerry 
Speziale, Sheriff of Passaic County, have already agreed toparticipate in 
public meetings sponsored by DRUM, PMP and CHRI.But because a large number 
of the post-September 11 detainees come from NewYork City, and specifically 
Brooklyn, we feel it is essential that a meetingtake place there as well as 
in NJ.  This is so that the families andcommunities of the detained can 
express their concerns and ask questions.We are asking you, as the New York 
District Director of the INS, toparticipate in the forum, helping create the 
transparency so necessary for aworking democracy.Our request is a simple 
one: a public meeting to ensure accountability andjustice.  We join DRUM, 
PMP and CHRI in calling for such a meeting.  We hopethat this will be a 
first step towards re-establishing due process as afundamental right under 
the Constitution for all. Such a meeting will allowan open dialogue with 
officials who have the authority to negotiate and beaccountable to their 
constituencies. Furthermore, we would like to set theagenda before hand for 
both meetings with local community members andcommunity organizations 
serving their needs.We look forward to your cooperation and participation in 
a publicconversation.We write this letter to you in the spirit of continuing 
to work together inthe service of our families and communities.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is sending out this email to inform the 
international community that one of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, 
ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON,  will be released from prison on MONDAY MAY 20TH, 
2002!!

Antonio is being forced into parole again, much like the last time about 3-5 
years ago.  Antonio refuses to sign on to any parole conditions and has 
publically expressed the fact that he will not be meeting with parole or

Press Release

New Brigade of Civil Disobedients bamboozle U.S. Navy!!

Yesterday, Sunday April 7th, 2002 a brigade of civil disobedients, organized 
by el Movimiento Socialista de Trabajadores/MST (Workers' Socialist 
Movement), penetrated the restricted bombing range in Vieques, bamboozling 
and defying the US Navy's increased security presence and precautions.

This brigade was dedicated to Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Pedro Colon 
Almenas, who has been unjustly incarcerated in Puerto Rico for being an 
anti-military activist.

The MST understands that the only way to remove the US Navy from Vieques is 
by confronting them using Civil disobedience.  The MST recognizes that the 
Puerto Rican Governor Sila Calderon and the Puerto Rican Police 
Superintendent are accomplices in the abuse against the people of Vieques 
this weekend, who were protesting and expressing their right of free speech.

Much like past civil disobedience brigades sent in by the MST, this brigade 
is in the restricted bombing range and will be disrupting the bombing 
practices.  They will deter the bombing practices and leave the range with 
out being arrested.

Brigade members are:

� Antonio Hern�ndez � A Teacher in San Sebastian
� Francisco B�ez � Retired teacher from Utaudo
� Humberto N��ez � Teacher from Rio Piedras
� Juan Alverio � Employee of the Dept. of Education in Juncos
� Andy Rivera � Retired Telecommunications Worker from Rio Piedras

Once again, we will hold the US Navy/military officials responsible for any 
pain/damage they cause the civil disobedients.

Spokesperson(787) 415-4286

Press Release

Civil Disobedient Arrested in Bombing Range in Vieques!!

At 7am this morning, Rafael Feliciano, a teacher, was arrested in the US 
Navy Bombing Range in Vieques.  He was able to communicate with others to 
let them know he was arrested, while he was seperated from the rest of the 
Brigade, that was organized by El Movimiento Socialista 
Trabajadores/Workers' Socialist Movement.

This group was able to infiltrate the bombing range at night on Saturday 
April 6th with the help of El Colective Cayo La Yayi, an organization from 
Vieques.  When he bombings recommenced on Monday April 8th, the brigade made 
their presence known and was able to halt the bombing practices.  Contrary 
to what the Navy alleged, we noticed from the civilian areas that the 
weather in Vieques during the supposed bombing time was fine and there was 
no reason why they couldn't practice.  In fact, we could hear Military 
Helicopters flying around until 2pm in the afternoon.


We are all very proud of the work that the comrades have been doing putting 
thier life and freedom on the line for peace in Vieques.  We hold the US 
Navy and the United States government responsible for any and ll harm that 
might befall the members of the Brigade.  This brigade will remanin the 
bombing range until the bombings are cancelled.

The brigade members are:
*Rafael Feliciano - Maestro
*Andy Rivera � Trabajador telef�nico retirado
*Johnny Alverio - Prensista
*Francisco Ba�z - Maestro retirado
*Humberto Nu�ez � Maestro

Vieques.  When he bombings recommenced on Monday April 8th, the brigade made 
their presence known and was able to halt the bombing practices.  Contrary 
to what the Navy alleged, we noticed from the civilian areas that the 
weather in Vieques during the supposed bombing time was fine and there was 
no reason why they couldn't practice.  In fact, we could hear Military 
Helicopters flying around until 2pm in the afternoon.


We are all very proud of the work that the comrades have been doing putting 
thier life and freedom on the line for peace in Vieques.  We hold the US 
Navy and the United States government responsible for any and ll harm that 
might befall the members of the Brigade.  This brigade will remanin the 
bombing range until the bombings are cancelled.

The brigade members are:
*Rafael Feliciano - Maestro
*Andy Rivera � Trabajador telef�nico retirado
*Johnny Alverio - Prensista
*Francisco Ba�z - Maestro retirado
*Humberto Nu�ez � Maestro

Luis �ngel Torres, Portavoz

Subject:happy birthday, Paul Robeson. 9 April<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>"The Real Reason Behind Robeson's Persecution"

( W.E.B. DuBois, From the 'National Guardian', April 7, 1958)

The persecution of Paul Robeson by the government and people of the United 
States during the last nine years has been one of the most contemptible 
happenings in modern history.

Robeson has done nothing to hurt or defame this nation.  He is, as all know, 
one of the most charming, charitable and loving of men.  There is no person 
on earth who ever heard Robeson slander or even attack the land of his 
birth.  Yet he had reason to despise America.

He was a black man; the son of black folk whom Americans had stolen and 
enslaved.  Even after his people's hard-won and justly earned freedom.  
America made their lot as near a hell on earth as was possible.  They 
discouraged, starved and insulted them.  They sneered at helpless black 
children.

Someone once said that the best punishment for Hitler would be to paint him 
black and send him to the United States.  This was no joke.  To struggle up 
as a black boy in America; to meet jeers and blows; to meet insult with 
silence and discrimination with a smile; to sit with fellow students who 
hated you and work and play for the honor of a college that disowned 
you--all this was America for Paul Robeson.

Yet he fought the good fight; "He was despised and rejected of men; a man of 
sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from Him; 
He was despised and we esteemed Him not."

Why?  Why?  Not because he attacked this country.  Search Britain and 
France, the Soviet Union and Scandinavia for a word of his against America.  
What then was his crime?

It was that while he did not rail at America he did praise the Soviet Union; 
and he did that because it treated him like a man and not a dog; because he 
and his family for the first time in life were welcomed like human beings 
and he was honored like a great man.

The children of Russia clung to him, the women kissed him; the workers 
greeted him; the state named mountains after him.  He loved their homage.  
His eyes were filled with tears and his heart with thanks.  Never before had 
he received such treatment.

In America he was a "nigger"; in Britain he was tolerated; in France he was 
cheered; in the Soviet Union he was loved for the great artist that he is.  
He loved the Soviet Union in turn.  He believed that every black man with 
blood in his veins would with him love the nation which first outlawed the 
color line.

I saw him when he voiced this.  It was in Paris in 1949 at the greatest 
rally for world peace this world ever witnessed.  Two thousand persons from 
all the world filled the Salle Pleyel from floor to rafters.  Robeson 
hurried in, magnificent in height and breadth, weary from circling Europe 
with song.  The audience rose to a man and the walls thundered.  Robeson 
said that his people wanted peace and "would never fight the Soviet Union."  
I joined with the thousands in wild acclaim.

					In Babylon, dark Babylon,

the modern breed of newspaper prostitute "who take the wage of shame" seized 
the chance to

					grovel to their master's mood
					the blood upon their pens
					assigns their souls to servitude
					Yea and the souls of men.

This, for America, was Robeson's crime.  He might hate anybody.  He might 
join in murder around the world.  He might lie and steal.  But for him to 
declare that he loved the Soviet Union and would not join in war against 
it--that was the highest crime that the United States recognized.

For that, they slandered Robeson; they tried to kill him at Peekskill; they 
prevented him from hiring halls in which to sing; they prevented him from 
travel and refused him a passport.  His college lied about him and 
dishonored him.

Above all, his own people, American Negroes, joined in hounding one of their 
greatest artists--not all, but some like those who wrote of Negro musicians 
and deliberately omitted Robeson's name--Robeson who more than any living 
man has spread the pure Negro folk song over the civilized world.

Yet has Paul Robeson kept his soul and stood his ground.  Stil he loves and 
honors the Soviet Union.  Still he has hope for America.  Still he asserts 
his faith in God.  But we--what can we say or do but hang our heads in 
endless shame?

As we celebrate the sixtieth birthday of Paul Robeson from Moscow to New 
Dehli, New York to California and Accra to Johannesburg, we can all take our 
stand and sing with him:

					Out of the night that covers me
					black as the pit from pole to pole,
					I thank whatever gods may be
					For my unconquerable soul.






unite the many, defeat the few!

Dear Friends and Supporters of Nicaragua:

With sadness and a great sense of moral outrage we report that Francisco 
Jos� Garc�a Valle, esteemed professor at the University of the Autonomous 
Regions  of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua and husband of Dr. Mar�a Luisa 
Acosta, internationally renown indigenous human rights lawyer was 
assassinated in his home on Monday night.

At the time of his murder, his wife was meeting with the IFCO/Pastors for 
Peace Central American Caravan to Chiapas, Honduras and Nicaragua, which had 
been in the region for the last week and a half.  Maria, who has received 
threats to her physical safety in the past because of her work advocating on 
behalf of indigenous communities fighting for their land and other basic 
human rights, was briefing the caravan on an important case that she is 
currently working on.  Had she not been away from her home meeting with the 
caravan, she could have met with the same fate as her husband.

Francisco Jose was found bound and gagged, shot in his heart.  A police 
investigation is under way, however at this time, there is no information 
available about who is responsible for this heinous act.

The caravan members were able to accompany Attorney Acosta today, but we 
remain extremely concerned about her continued safety given this violent 
attack against her immediate family.  The caravan held a press conference 
Tuesday afternoon in Managua to call for the immediate apprehension of the 
assassins and for the guaranteed protection of Attorney Acosta and her 
family.

IFCO/Pastors for Peace is urgently requesting that you communicate your 
concern to Nicaraguan President Enrique Bola�os, specifically calling to:

1.  Express your  outrage at the senseless murder of Francisco Jos� Garc�a 
Valle and concern for the security of Maria Acosta and her family, who have 
been at the forefront of the struggle for indigenous rights in the region.
2.  Demand that the security of Maria Acosta and her family be ensured by 
the government of Nicaragua and that a rigorous, stepped up investigation 
into the murder begin NOW.
3.  Demand that the assassins be immediately apprehended and brought to 
justice.

Please address your letters to President Enrique Bola�os to:

Subject: Advice on violence-free dating

      When it comes to dating, there seem to be many contradictions in
"the rules."  In my opinion, most circumstances require different actions
and reactions, and therefore can't be part of a clear dating game.  You
need to understand the person, the situation, and then decide how to act
based on your best judgement.   There is one charastic of most women that
may help you.  In fact, you will realize that men and women are the same
in this way.  For example, be yourself and don't pretend to be anyone
else, but DO NOT act too forward and eager by being overly-nice and
smothering.  You would not want a girl who called you all the time and
followed you around.  Both men and women (as much as it seems stupid)
will be more interested in someone who is harder to get.  Another
suggestion regarding looking for a girlfriend is not to go for a girl
solely because you find her attractive.  Make sure she is smart and you
like her personality.  The best relationships are often found through
friendships.  However, be careful, friendships can also be ruined in this
way.  There are ways to tell if someone is interested in you.  Trust your
instincts.  Think about the way a girl looks at you and the body
language.  Regarding asking a girl out: go for it -as long as you have
talked to her for a little while.  Keep in mind though, most guys get
"shot down" 99% of the time.  DO NOT loose confidence if that happens a
lot.  That happens A LOT to every guy!  The best advise I can give you is
to always be yourself, but do not open your soul until the girl deserves
to be so close to you.  You will find someone who is right for you, but
relationships are never easy.  Even when you love someone there are
fights.  Furthermore, you know how much your parents can piss you off? 
A woman you love can and will piss you off even more!  This happens when
you care so much about a person.  Believe me, no one can make me more mad
than Ian.  Be prepared to hold your temper.  Staying in love is constant
work.  Make sure you are confident and sure of yourself before entering a
relationship.  People make a mistake when they try to understand who they
are and gain confidence through someone else.  Adding another person
makes some things in life easier and other things much harder.  Look for
someone to have fun with and then see what happens!  A great woman will
brighten your life-most of the time- and you will be a wonderful gift to
her life. 

            Sorry about the spelling.  I hope I said a few interesting
things.


                                 Wish you good luck,
						
						 Jaclyn

PRESS RELEASE

October 2001 marked the 35th Anniversary of the founding of
the Black Panther Party for Self Defense (BPP). As a result
of the events of September 11th, the BPP Reunion and
Conference originally planned to take place in October was
postponed and has been rescheduled for April 18th through 20th,
2002. Although the origins of the BPP were in Oakland, CA,
and previous conferences have been held in California, the
Black Panther Party had over 48 offices around the country
and many of our major offices were on the east coast. This
year's celebration will be held in Washington DC to recognize
the contributions of our east coast comrades. This event will
take place at the University of the District of Columbia, in
Washington DC. Previous registrations and advertising will
be honored.

The Conference will feature panel discussions on reparations
for the descendants of African slaves, political prisoners and
Cointelpro (the FBI's illegal program to disrupt progressive
political groups and destroy the BPP). The conference will
feature workshops designed to formulate strategies to obtain
freedom for political prisoners, combat police brutality,
protect civil rights, build solidarity in the movement, and
remunerate the victims of Cointelpro. There will also be
workshops on women in the BPP, the difference between the
BPP and the New BPP, and a number of workshops focusing on
Youth. There will be some closed sessions dealing with issues
pertinent to former Panthers.

Historic photo displays will be open the public and will include
over 60 photographs covering the early development of the Black
Panther Party through 1975. There will also be an exhibit of the
Black Panther Party Newspaper which at one time produced more
than 150,000 copies a week, and an exhibit of the New York Panther
Paper "Right On" There will be an ongoing film-video festival during
the entire conference with many topical films regarding the history
of the black Panther Party, political prisoners, Cointelpro and the
movement in general. Saturday evening, April 20, there will be a
buffet dinner reception, an opportunity to socialize and visit with
old friends and comrades.

This is an opportunity for older, more experienced activists to share
their knowledge and experience with young, enthusiastic activists of
today. It is also an opportunity for isolated activists in related fields
to come together to share creative and practical resources in the
fight for social justice.

We invite all former Panthers, community workers and current and
former activists in the cause of social justice to attend. For more

Subject:More on Vieques Political Prisoners!!<br>

<pre>Vieques protesters sentenced; trespasses not 'justified'

By MANUEL ERNESTO RIVERA
Associated Press

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (April 10, 2002 10:48 p.m. EDT) - Five
members of Puerto Rico's pro-independence party were sentenced
to 30 days in a federal detention center Wednesday for breaking
into U.S. Navy property to protest bombing exercises on Vieques
island.

The five women were detained after breaking though Navy fences
on April 1, when Navy planes resumed dropping inert bombs
on the island's firing range after a pause of several months.

The five did not mount defenses to their trespassing charges
because they say they don't recognize the federal court's
authority in the U.S. territory.

"Vieques is the most open and painful wound of our country,"
Maria de Lourdes Santiago, leader of the five and vice president
of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, said before her sentencing.
She said the situation illustrates "what it means to live
in a country where others rule."

The five - also including Irma Rodriguez, Maria Elena Negron,
Mirna Rodriguez and Maribel Arroyo - will receive credit
for time already served in jail.

Handing down the sentences, Judge Salvador Casellas said
he respected the defendants' ideology, but "in my opinion
the acts of civil disobedience that have occurred in Vieques
at this moment aren't justified."

He said that because the United States is at war, Puerto
Ricans as U.S. citizens have "a responsibility" to support
national defense.

The judge also denied bail on Wednesday for five members
of the Socialist Movement group who were detained on Navy
lands this week, ordering them held until their trials are
scheduled.

Opponents of the Navy exercises say they harm the environment
and the health of Vieques' 9,100 residents. The Navy denies
that claim.

Although the protests have been muted since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, small bands of demonstrators have held
protests during the current round of exercises, which could
last up to three weeks. On Wednesday, no new arrests were
reported as U.S. warplanes dropped inert bombs on the firing
range.

Puerto Rico's small pro-independence party makes up only
one part of the opposition to Vieques training. Gov. Sila
Calderon, who supports the island's current commonwealth
status, also says the Navy should halt exercises.

Since maneuvers began April 1 on the outlying island, more
than a dozen people have been detained. The Navy says 13
sailors and Marines have been injured by protesters throwing
rocks and other objects. The demonstrators say their protests
have been peaceful.

President Bush says the Navy will leave by 2003. The Navy
says it is looking for alternative training sites.

<pre>2 witness statements:

To whom it may concern:

I was sitting in the auditorium at New Brunswick High School waiting for the 
Board members to return from their private session.  I heard a voice saying, 
"Please, don't touch me."  I turned toward the back of the auditorium, I saw 
Cliff Smith standing in the aisle with his hands behind his back clasped 
together.  Surrounding him were security guards saying to Cliff, "You have 
to leave the building."  The security guards were pushing him towards the 
door.  Cliff kept saying, "Please, don't touch me."  I saw the security 
guards slam Cliff Smith against the entrance door of the auditorium and 
pushed him outside the door.  His hands were still clasped behind his back.  
At that moment the Board returned to the auditorium.  I heard a disturbance 
in the hallway.  I saw Mrs. Moody, NBHS attendence officer, walk down the 
aisle of the auditorium toward the stage.  She returned with Mr. Embrey, the 
principal of NBHS. They walked outside of the auditorium toward the voices.

Beverly Marshall
President, New Brunswick Apartments Tenants' Association


To whom it may concern:

In honor so that the truth comes to light, I would like to testify my 
rendition of what I was a witness to of events that occured on the night of 
January 15th circa the time of 7:15 pm at New Brunswick High School.

Having a clear view as I sat within the central seating section of the 
institution's auditorium in attendance of a public meeting held by the New 
Brunswick Board of Education, on this night, I witnessed Cliff Smith, an 
individual that I have seen at several of these meetings within the same 
setting and have grown to hold conversations of a delicate educational 
nature, held a fervor converation with one Mr. Pierre Embrey, principal of 
the institution to which my daughters attend.  The conversation escalated 
due to the fact that Mr. Cliff Smith was passing out literature with the 
school's results of state mandatory examination.  I was able to observe that 
Mr. Embrey had in his hands papers, which he tried to give to Mr. Cliff 
Smith and Mr. Smith rose his hands high in the air as Mr. Embrey forced them 
upon his person and down his shirt.  Mr. Embrey told Mr. Smith to leave and 
forced him out of the auditorium using the aid of security guards although 
he did not resist.  After he was thrown out of the auditorium all we saw 
heard him exclaim was the fact that he was in a public meeting.

Next Mr. Embrey and Donald Bowling proceeded to take out Mr. Smith's brother 
Joe Smith out of the auditorium with brute force and throwing him up against 
the wall.  While Mr. Donald Bowling held him crucified up against the wall 
and repeatedly proceeded to push him repeatedly which caused him to hit his 
head several times against the wall.  Then Mr. Joe Smith was thrown to the 
ground and held had his neck under massive pressure from the force applied 
to it by Mr. Embrey's knee as evident from the screaming exhibited by Mr. 
Joe Smith.  Mr. Embrey then went into Mr. Joe Smith's pocket and retrieved a 
cellular phone stating would confiscate it because Mr. Joe Smith had been 
making bomb threats to the school.  Mr. Smign said it was his personal phone 
and that Embrey had no right to take it.  The police arrived and Mr. Joe 
Smith left with the authorities without contest.

I hold everything written in this letter to be the truth and self-evident.  
I cannot certify any previous actions by the Smiths that would have provoked 
this event.  However, their behavior was nothing but passive while Mr. 
Embrey and Mr. Donald Bowling exhibited in my opinion what would be an abuse 
of authority through aggressive behavior with loose cannon composure.

Attentively,

Ivan Salazar
President, Bilingual Parents' Association of New Brunswick

Private Groups Get 42 Schools in Philadelphia

April 18, 2002 

By JACQUES STEINBERG


 

PHILADELPHIA, April 17 - In what is believed to be the
largest experiment in privatization mounted by an American
school district, a state panel charged with improving the
Philadelphia public school system voted tonight to transfer
control of 42 failing city schools to seven outside
managers, including Edison Schools Inc. and two
universities. 

The three members of the School Reform Commission appointed
by Gov. Mark Schweiker voted for the plan, while the two
members appointed by Mayor John F. Street voted against it.
The vote capped a fiery three-hour meeting in which the two
sides had split over whether Edison, the nation's largest
for-profit operator of public schools, had the capacity and
know-how to improve the 20 schools that it was assigned. 

"I want this reform to succeed," Michael Masch, a vice
president at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the
mayor's two appointees to the panel, said at one point in
the debate. "I am gravely concerned that the magnitude of
the change being proposed is imprudent." 

Moments later, James P. Gallagher, the president of
Philadelphia University and one of the governor's three
appointees, said, "We should push the envelope and be as
aggressive as possible." 

The panel's vote today represents a milestone in the
decade-long growth of the movement to turn troubled public
schools over to private operators. There is no better index
of the impact of this effort than Edison's own expansion:
over the last six years, it has gone from operating a
handful of public schools to more than 130 in 22 states,
with a combined student population that is larger than all
but a few dozen urban districts. 

All told, the Philadelphia panel voted to assign an outside
manager to one of every six schools in the city. In
addition to Edison, the other organizations involved
include two colleges that are in Philadelphia: Temple
University, which was assigned five schools, and the
University of Pennsylvania, which received three schools. 

The panel also tapped four other companies with various
degrees of school administrative experience, though each
was smaller than Edison. They are Chancellor Beacon
Academies Inc., a for-profit company based in Florida that
operates public and private schools (assigned five
schools); Foundations Inc., a nonprofit organization in
Philadelphia that offers after-school programs (four
schools); Victory Schools Inc., a New York-based company
that opened the state's first charter school (three
schools); and Universal Companies, a new venture begun by
the record producer Kenny Gamble (two schools). 

How much responsibility those managers would be given in
the schools that they have been assigned remains to be
negotiated with the state panel, as well as with the
teachers' union and the parents in those schools. But panel
officials said that, in many instances, the outsiders would
likely make sweeping changes in school curriculum, as well
as seek to replace school administrators and many of the
teachers. 

After the meeting, Jerry Jordan, a vice president of the
Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, said he regretted that
the panel had said so little about how the schools would be
redesigned by the outsiders. 

"They didn't spell anything out," Mr. Jordan said. "It's
like, `Let's see what works.' It shows a total lack of
respect." 

After the roll was called, several dozen student
protesters, who have long argued that it was undemocratic
for a for-profit company to operate a public school,
chanted, "Shame!" and "I am not for sale!" 

Beginning at daybreak, those same protesters had succeeded
in shutting down the system's Art Deco administrative
building on Benjamin Franklin Parkway by forming a
barricade at the entrance. Neither police officers nor the
building's 350 employees were willing to cross the line. As
a result, the meeting, which had been scheduled for 1 p.m.
at district headquarters, was delayed for two hours then
was moved to the city's African American Museum, nearly a
mile away. 

Today's developments were the most significant here since
late December, when Mr. Schweiker, a Republican, assumed
control of the city school system, which had been operated
by a board of education appointed entirely by Mr. Street, a
Democrat. At the time, Mr. Schweiker said that only a bold
approach could save a system in which more than half of the
nearly 200,000 students had failed to achieve minimum
proficiency on state reading and math tests. 

The governor had also made clear at the time that he wanted
Edison, which operates more than 130 public schools in 22
states, to play a major role in Philadelphia. Though the 20
schools that the company was awarded today was more than
double the number it manages in any other district, the
assignment was far more modest than the 60 Philadelphia
schools that it said it was capable of managing. 

Indeed, the governor had once argued that Edison should
assume control of the system's central administration.
Later, he retreated in the face of opposition from many
parents and students, as well as the teachers' union and
other labor groups representing school employees. They
questioned Edison's academic and financial record. 

At a news conference, James P. Nevels, the panel's
chairman, said of Edison's role, "Things have not turned
out as one would have expected." 

Still, a majority of the panel members managed to pass a
school reform plan in Philadelphia today that was more
ambitious than those mounted in any other district. 

The largest such plan previously was believed to have been
in Hartford, where all 32 schools in the district were
given over to the company Education Alternatives Inc. for
less than two years in the mid-1990's. But largely because
the Hartford experience failed relatively quickly, other
districts have usually embarked on more modest experiments,
with Edison now operating nine schools in Chester-Upland,
Pa., outside Philadelphia, and seven in Clark County, Nev.,
the Las Vegas district. 

In addition to the 42 schools that the Philadelphia panel
assigned to outside managers, it also ordered that 28 other
schools undergo substantial reorganization, with some
becoming more independent charter schools but most
remaining within direct control of the district. In the
cases of the schools identified today for private
intervention, the panel reserved the right to revoke a
contract in instances where the schools fail to improve.

Robert Rabin, one of the key leaders of the peace
movement in Vieques, was given an unconscionably lengthy jail
sentence of six (6) months yesterday by magistrate judge Gustavo
Gelpi of the federal district court in Puerto Rico.  Gelpi also
sentenced attorney Hiram Lozada P�rez, President of the Civil Rights
Commission of the Puerto Rican Bar Association, to four (4) months in
jail, and sentenced Iv�n El�as Rodr�guez and Oscar Charriez to one
hundred days in jail.  Gelpi additionally imposed fines on them.
Their crimes? A misdemeanor for trespassing by entering the bombing
range in Vieques. As he has done with other protesters, Gelpi's
sentencing went beyond what the prosecutors recommended.  Other key
leaders of the Vieques peace movement have also received absurdly
lengthy prison sentences, for example, Vieques Mayor Damaso Serrano
(4 months), Vieques Fishermen Association's President Carlos Zenon (6
months), and others.]

BELOW IS A STATEMENT WRITTEN BY ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON ON HIS RELEASE
______________________________________________________________________
Dear Compatriots:

This afternoon I do not find myself physically close to all of you, but my 
heart, my thoughts and my words are with you during this commemoration of 
the birth of Juan Antonio Corretjer.  Because I have sent a written message, 
  I will be brief.

As all of you know, I have rejected, time and again, every attempt by the 
government of the United States to criminalize our legitimate right to 
struggle for our independence by the recognized avenues afforded us
by our high moral standards, history and international law.

I have repeatedly denounced colonialism and a conditional freedom and 
consistent with this I have also rejected the conditional freedom that the 
United States government has sought to impose upon me in the
same manner in which I reject the conditional freedom under which our Puerto 
Rican homeland suffers.

On May 9th two-thirds of my sentence will be done.  According to the laws of 
the empire my release is mandatory.  Because I continue to reject any type 
of conditions for this supposed freedom, the government of the United States 
will hold me until May 20th with the purpose of having me report to the 
Federal Building in Puerto Rico.  I completely reject that condition.

I invite you to join me in front of the Federal Building (in Puerto Rico) on 
May 22nd at noon, not to sign for my freedom, but to reaffirm our freedom 
and our Puertoricanness.

Compatriots:

The independence of our homeland will not be a gift that is granted to us by 
the Congress of the  United States:  The independence of our homeland must 
be taken, we must win it.

Empires are not deities, they are structures lead by men and women.  They 
are omnipotent while there exist men and women that because of ignorance, 
opportunism or cowardice, surrender their souls and are
indifferent to its injustices and harm.

Don Pedro said:   "We do not have the arms to deal a blow to their naval 
forces, but we have the moral force to deal a blow to their reputation in 
the eyes of the world."

Many constantly repeat these words, but they are not empty words.  In this 
concept lies the key to our independence.

We who believe in the independence of our country, who grasp the urgency of 
becoming a free and sovereign nation have to bury defeatism and develop the 
aunthentic support of the majority.

We can not content ourselves with exercising some influences or to establish 
some goals.  Even less should we find satisfaciton in the electoral carnival 
that takes place every four years - suicidal faith in elections and our 
participatory collaboration in them - have robbed our people of the natural 
tendency to be free.

The present conditions favor us and call for us to become a minority for 
change; a minority is a force for transformation. A minority will be an 
authentic support of the majority.

The Sovereignty, dignity and liberty of our people cannot be conditioned by 
fear, by myopic interests, opportunism or ignorance, even if it comes from 
the majority.  The banners of freedom, sovereignty and dignity of the people 
have never first been championed by the broad masses.  It has always been a 
minority that through its example of persistance, love, sacrifice and 
courage, has brought the masses to embrace these ideals.

Independentistas, are not a majority but we are the legitimate 
representatives of the freedom and dignity of our homeland.  More than a 
duty we have to ourselves, it is our responsibility to the men and women who 
have given their lives or have dedicated them to this sacred ideal.  More 
so, it is our responsibility to future generations and to humanity itself.

To struggle for independence is to struggle for the highest universal values 
of justice, dignity, sovereignty and liberty.  And while there exists even 
one colony in the world, these values will be contested. Humanity has paid a 
very dear price for these and will can not and will not betray them.

Let us remember our compatriots!

" We do not have the arms to deal a blow to the naval forces, but we have 
the moral force to deal a blow to their reputation in the eyes of the 
world."

This is their achilles heal.
This is our challenge.

Thank you all.

Subject:POP proposal<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>to POP,
on behalf of the new brunswick peoples campaign, i must state that we are 
very disappointed with the lack of POP's involvement in newark's may 14 
election.

one would think that an organization with such "Progressive" positions would 
jump at the chance to work to elect ras baraka. there will be earl faisons 
until the cows come home unless we organize these communities to win 
political power. all those rallies become meaningless without political 
direction. political direction exists in the baraka campaign for council 
At-Large, but yet POP is satisfied with just the rally/march/lobbying?

yes we know, we have seen hamm here &amp; hamm there at baraka events - but hamm 
is not POP &amp; POP is not there.

how can POP demand community police control boards for newark, but not 
actively support the candidate that CAN WIN &amp; will draft up this 
legislation? why is POP going to lobby trenton about police misconduct &amp;tc., 
when those positions can be implemented here in newark?

nbpc proposes that POP immediately put all resources toward electing ras 
baraka on may 14. push back the trenton lobby date of may 15 and do the much 
needed work to elect ras baraka. this is a formal proposal, there is still 
time -
tic...

i remember in '98 hungerford/henson was a point person of the baraka 
campaign, among many other activities he brought me lunch on election day 
from baraka headquaters and drove me to diffent polling sites. now we see an 
organization from new brunswick put forward a better effort to elect ras 
baraka than POP? what should people think about this?

Millions of Italians Take to the Streets in a General Strike

April 17, 2002 

By MELINDA HENNEBERGER


In the first daylong general strike in 20 years, millions of
Italian workers protested the conservative government's
plans to create a more flexible labor market.

&gt;To: hub city &lt;TheHubCityNJ@yahoogroups.com&gt;, PRAB &lt;PRAB@yahoogroups.com&gt;
&gt;Subject: [TheHubCityNJ] A New Play about NEW BRUNSWICK
&gt;Date: Mon, 22 Apr 2002 10:41:32 -0400
&gt;
&gt;For Immediate Release
&gt;April 22, 2002
&gt;
&gt;                      PUBLIC GHOSTS-PRIVATE STORIES
&gt;     a new play celebrating NEW BRUNSWICK at George Street Playhouse
&gt;      "NAME YOUR OWN PRICE" for Theatre Tickets on Tuesday, April 23
&gt;
&gt;A glorious sympohy of stories about our town...  tales of murder and
&gt;arson; a baby saved and a baby lost; an impossible love between a free
&gt;man and an enslaved woman; and three silver spoons that haunt a family
&gt;for four generations... all come together under the embracing branches
&gt;of Joyce Kilmer's immortalized tree.
&gt;
&gt;Inspired by the personal testimonies of present day New Brunswick area
&gt;residents, PUBLIC GHOSTS-PRIVATE STORIES is a beautifully woven tapestry
&gt;of over one hundred and eight years of Hispanic, Hungarian, Irish and
&gt;African-American life in our town.
&gt;
&gt;"Name Your Own Price" tickets may be purchased in person at the box
&gt;office on Tuesday, April 23 for that evening's 8 pm performance.  The
&gt;price of the ticket is at the discretion of the person making the
&gt;purchase (GSP asks that it be at least $1). The GSP box office will open

&gt; &gt;      "NAME YOUR OWN PRICE" for Theatre Tickets on Tuesday, April 23
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A glorious sympohy of stories about our town...  tales of murder and
&gt; &gt;arson; a baby saved and a baby lost; an impossible love between a free
&gt; &gt;man and an enslaved woman; and three silver spoons that haunt a family
&gt; &gt;for four generations... all come together under the embracing branches
&gt; &gt;of Joyce Kilmer's immortalized tree.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Inspired by the personal testimonies of present day New Brunswick area
&gt; &gt;residents, PUBLIC GHOSTS-PRIVATE STORIES is a beautifully woven tapestry
&gt; &gt;of over one hundred and eight years of Hispanic, Hungarian, Irish and
&gt; &gt;African-American life in our town.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;"Name Your Own Price" tickets may be purchased in person at the box
&gt; &gt;office on Tuesday, April 23 for that evening's 8 pm performance.  The
&gt; &gt;price of the ticket is at the discretion of the person making the
&gt; &gt;purchase (GSP asks that it be at least $1). The GSP box office will open
&gt; &gt;at 10 am on Tuesday, April 23.

&gt;Subject: Re: recommendation for POP involvement in Ras Baraka's campaign
&gt;Date: Mon, 22 Apr 2002 13:21:03 EDT
&gt;
&gt;Hi Joe,
&gt;
&gt;I'm responding to your e-mail about POP's involvement in Ras Baraka's
&gt;campaign, because I believe that it contains a good recommendation which is
&gt;undermined by it's approach and tone. As an example of political
&gt;conversation, I suggest that it is not likely to effectively elicit the
&gt;support that you seek, but rather will either divert energy from our
&gt;complementary modes of work or just be ignored.
&gt;
&gt;As a member of POP, an organization that I suspect is allied with or at 
&gt;least
&gt;has coals in common with NBPC,  I suggest that a positive approach relying 
&gt;on
&gt;the merits of the substance of your suggestion would be much more effective
&gt;than personal and organizational attacks that denigrate the  complementary
&gt;work that we do. Only the fifth paragraph of your e-mail contains a 
&gt;positive
&gt;proposal.
&gt;
&gt;Why did you take such an approach? Why can't we acknowledge complementary
&gt;efforts? If there is disagreement about priorities, why can't they be aired
&gt;without sarcasm and disdain. If there is a good argument for a particular 
&gt;appr
&gt;oach, then use that argument without denigrating others' priorities? Why 
&gt;not
&gt;urge, encourage and support the work of allied organizations? An approach
&gt;that is not an attack is more likely to change people's minds. We have 
&gt;enough
&gt;common adversaries. Let's treat each other's allied organizations with
&gt;courtesy and respect.
&gt;
&gt;On a substantive level, do you know the efforts that POP has made to 
&gt;support
&gt;Ras Baraka or what plans we have to do so? Have you spoken with him and his
&gt;campaign about POP's involvement? If he wants more help or you think we
&gt;should do more, then it is much more effective to ask for help in the work
&gt;that needs to be done than to brag that your organization has done more? 
&gt;Why
&gt;not tell us what you have been doing and suggest ways that we add to 
&gt;existing
&gt;efforts?
&gt;
&gt;I am, myself, particularly "disappointed" that you would choose to 
&gt;criticize
&gt;the attention that POP has paid to the Faison case and the Faison family, 
&gt;for
&gt;several reasons.  I suggest that we need to tend to the needs of 
&gt;individuals,
&gt;because individuals need support in our society, individual struggles help 
&gt;us
&gt;understand systemic problems better, and such actions best demonstrate our
&gt;underlying humanity.
&gt;
&gt;I agree that political direction is also necessary.
&gt;
&gt;I suspect that people in POP will pass by the unconstructive elements of 
&gt;your
&gt;e-mail, cut to the chase, and think about what we could and should be doing
&gt;to help Ras. I certainly intend to bring up the substantive issue at
&gt;Thursday's  meeting this week. So I hope that this e-mail will not spawn a
&gt;diversion of analysis. This is simple stuff we should all know about how to
&gt;work together. Please try to do better in the future.
&gt;

Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt;From: makemba@...

Some people will say and do anything for a free lunch.

I must give my comments here.   And let me be very clear and upfront
in saying that I am not speaking for the organization right now.

It is not your suggestion per se that I object to, for I am always
open  to hearing suggestions from concerned people in the
community about things POP can and should
be doing.   What I object to is your arrogant and condescending
attitude that is thinly disguised as a suggestion.  And quite frankly,
you ain't got no reason to be arrogant or condescending!

As an individual member of POP I could personally give a hoot
as to whether or not your organization is satisfied with the work that
I do!   To put it bluntly --  I don't do things for the sake of impressing
people who live outside of my community.

I have seen this attitude before from certain people who live way outside of
this community.
They come around here with their little superior acting attitudes
and then think they are going to put people in this community down because
they don't think as they do!

I could go ON AND ON AND ON about the things I don't see your organization
doing!


People in POP have been fighting hard and have been on
the front line of these issues!   And we are comprised of
people who share many different ideologies that don't allow
are differences to get in the way of what we must do.

And POP was one of the first organizations to start to become
very vocal about issues that other organizations in NJ did not
want to touch!

Furthermore, people in POP LIVE THESE ISSUES ! ! !
We take a personal hands on approach with our community.
We don't just sit around and intellectualize and theorize about
things!

One of the main problems with the progessive movement in
this country is that there are those who LIVE it and there are
those for which this is a fad -- something "in" to do!   There are
those who can change their affiliations and ideas just as they are
changing their clothes.  When it's no longer vogue to belong to
the progressive movement they can just drop things and go right
back into their communities and get their nice jobs and call it
a day!  History proves me true on this point.

I remember about  a little over 10 years people were
talking about how they weren't liberal.   I don't recall anybody too much
talking about being liberal back in the 80's and 90's.
Then it simply wasn't fashionable for many
to be affiliated with progressive causes.

In fact back in 1991 when I was victimized by police brutality,
I couldn't find people who wanted to hear about it.  I had a difficult
enough time finding people locally.   And forget about finding
anyone who lived outside of this area!

I hope we won't see that trend again within the progressive movement!

So here's some advice.  Before you began to want to criticize others
make sure you look inward first.

Personally, I think your comment about your free lunch was very revealing.

Thank you, Jean for saying what I'm sure so many of us feel about Mr. Joe
Smith's approach. Although he claims to be a communist, he still clearly has
not learned the difference between how to approach people's organizations 
and
how to approach our enemies. He says he upholds Mao but obviously doesn't
practice the wisdom contained in his supposed mentor's "On Contradiction,"
i.e., that  there is a difference between antagonistic and non-antagonistic
contradictions and therefore a difference in how we need to approach our
friends and our enemies.

I intend to become more involved in the Ras Baraka campaign between now and
election day, despite Mr. Smith. I only hope to be able to do so and at the
same time am able to stay as far way from Mr. Smith as possible. I think Ras
should be informed of the disservice Mr. Smith has done to his campaign by
attacking groups like POP and, before this, the Greens.

Democrats vs. Israel

Most of the leaders of the Democratic Party and its liberal

of its defense against Arafat's war.

On Earth Day, Bush V. Gore

By Dan Balz and Dana Milbank

On the 32nd anniversary of Earth Day, President Bush said yesterday that his environmental initiatives would reduce power plant emissions more than those of any previous administration. But he faced a barrage of criticism from environmental groups and former rival Al Gore, who charged that Bush has broken his word and sold out to polluters and special interests.

&gt;
&gt;Well, Well, Well, Mr. Joe Smith ,
&gt;
&gt;I speak at this time not on behalf of POP. I am speaking
&gt;as an individual who is a member of POP. Let it be known
&gt;that in the organization of the People's Organization
&gt;for Progress we reserve the right to our individuality
&gt;although we are united under our "Aims and Purposes"
&gt;which does not include endorsing specific parties or
&gt;candidates or following specific religions. I will send
&gt;you a copy of our newsletter which states the POP Aims
&gt;and Purposes if you would like to have one.
&gt;
&gt;As for your disappointment, I am well aware of Ras
&gt;Baraka's campaign. I live in Newark and have every
&gt;intention of voting for him. By the way , I am still
&gt;waiting for the window poster I was supposed to get as
&gt;promised by one of the "involved campaign workers." Just
&gt;because you have not seen people that you know as POP
&gt;members down at the campaign headquarters, does not mean
&gt;that there is no support for Ras by POP members. YOU
&gt;SHOULD KNOW THAT! After all, is it more important for me
&gt;to show up at the headquarters under the pretense of
&gt;support or actually talking to my neighbors and co-
&gt;workers about the great very qualified person I believe
&gt;Ras to be. I support Ras everyday and maybe I might get
&gt;a chance to get to the headquarters or maybe I won't. I
&gt;ask you Mr. Joe Smith, by not showing up for you or
&gt;anyone else to see, have I caused any harm to his
&gt;campaign or have I convinced a few people to go to the
&gt;polls on May 14th and cast a vote for Ras Baraka. As you
&gt;have said , there is  still time-tic...  You speak , it
&gt;appears without much thought but with much passion.
&gt;Before you attack the POP members for lack of
&gt;"involvement," think of another approach.
&gt;

debby, it is definitely not my "job" to look up directions, drive over, &amp; 
stick a sign in your lawn. but if i didn't, who would? it is my DUTY to the 
struggle for democracy!! that is what the baraka campaign represents; an 
advance on behalf of the international peoples forces in the struggle for 
democracy. all those marching in DC did great, but a stronger show of 
international solidarity is to seize these local governments &amp; our cities 
institutions.

what does that mean "leave it alone, let it be"?
it is POP's organizational DUTY to support &amp; elect ras baraka (as an 
organization! not individuals!), anything less is a betrayal of those 
struggling right along side you. so no debby, NBPC will not let it be &amp; we 
will not leave it alone. we will criticize &amp; expose what we see as mistakes 
in POP &amp; any other organization that claims to represent the people, in

your strategy has produced bush2, where is the greens self-criticism &amp;

that is the only way to re-start efforts in new brunswick.

side note- coleman for governor - 71 votes in new brunswick '01

Subject:The Green Party not Wasting Resources<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>First of all, Mr.Smith, the Green Party is not wasting money on federal and state elections. In 2000, if Ralph Nader has recieved 5% of the popular vote, the Green Party of the United States would have recieved federal money for the 2004 Presidetnal Elections. This would have given the 2004 Presidental Nominee the opptunity to boardcast on Television, Radio, and major Newspapers arguments for incrasing the minimum wage to 11 dollars per hour (what the United States Department of Labor states is the amount needed for a person to live in the United States without health care. 
      Speaking of Health Care, The GPUS would have the oppotunity to raise the issue of Univeral Health Care and Child Care. Arguments could be heard on why and how to clean the air, waterways, and land from short-term and long-term toxic chemicals, and how to replace an economy based on oil to an economy based on renewable energies, such as solar and wind power. 
      Neither President Bush or Al Gore stated that they wished to do this things. Research the NY Times arcivies at your local library to read Bush's or Gore's speeches at their conventions, or on the campaign trails. 

      Now, on the state level. In New Jersey, if a political party recieves 10% of the total general assembly vote, then that party recieves ballot access (i.e. not having to stand in front of supermarkets to get a candidate on the ballot.), and it able to hold primaries if they so desire (21 State Green Parties, including California, New York, Texas, and Minnoseta, have ballot status). This would be a very democratic way for elections to held, a choice between at least three canddiates instead of two, what a wonderful thing!
      
      Finally, there is a Green Party in every state in the USA and in most countries around the world. We have suceeded in gaining seats in German, French, and English parliaments (to name a few). We have had state assemblypersons in California, and will continue to do so among the rest of the states in the great country. If the Democratic Party claims we cost them elections, then their canddiate should be one that makes any Green Party candidate obselete. Please use the non-partasian websites WWW.OPENSECRETS.ORG and WWW.VOTE-SMART.ORG to see how many Democratic candidates are funded, in many cases, by the same money the Republican Party is funded with. I hope you use this knowledge.
                                           Peacefully,
                                                `Ray Higbee

Message:<br><br>
<pre>UNITY &amp; STRUGGLE �BULLETIN ����4 /19/02


The Trojan Horse

Communists &amp; REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATS understand that there can be no 
socialist revolution without the completion of the Democratic Revolution. 
(See Lenin, Mao). They also know that the Revolutionaries must take the lead 
in the completion of a Democratic Revolution and even when utilizing the 
bourgeois instrument of Electoral Politics, must use it to forward the 
themes, the political lines, the ideological clarity of the revolutionary 
leaders of the Working Class.
For these reasons Revolutionaries running in bourgeois elections never 
consider Only their own candidacy, but take in to consideration the critical 
needs and issues of the working class. If they narrow their view to consider 
Only their own election to a seat, and do not put out the issues and themes 
that affect the whole working class, then they have become somewhat 
politically retarded so that their "insurgency" is reduced to the narrow 
career considerations of the petty bourgeois democrat !
In the Newark elections of May 14, Ras Baraka and in the alliance with the 
Puerto Rican north ward candidate, Hector Corchado, are without a doubt the 
most progressive force in the election. The very political strength and 
democratic leadership that their alliance has projected "Black-Latino Unity" 
draws the entire mass base of the grassroots constituency together, in 
defiance of the bogus "teams" both mayoral candidates have projected which 
excludes both Baraka and Corchado.
This theme is especially relevant and necessary because of the betrayals to 
this unity which were demonstrated in the New York City and Los Angeles 
Mayoral contests where Black &amp; Latino Bourgeois Democratic politicians 
sabotaged that unity so that both Latino Mayoral candidates were defeated 
and so called "moderate" whites �were elected. Bloomberg in NYC spent 59 
million and bought colored quislings on the spot. Hahn in LA using the beard 
of his father's bravery in meeting Dr. King at the airport, and his palm 
greasing of Negro politicians, zig zagged his way into office, and upon 
being elected immediately announced that he was firing the Black Police 
Chief. Now the Negroes are whining, betrayal. But it was their betrayal 
which allowed Hahn's.
In Newark, some people believe that as long as they vote for RAS BARAKA and 
HECTOR CORCHADO, they have fulfilled their progressive obligations so that 
they can covertly vote for the Wall St Trojan Horse, Corey Booker. But this 
is simply a failure to closely examine and analyze the entire meaning of 
this campaign.
On one hand you have Sharpe James, in public office since the Community's 
Choice Campaign of 1970. He is part of the Afro American National 
Bourgeoisie. Always compromising with Corporate Capital, usually shaky in 
confronting the big dogs of government and business. an important operative 
in the Democratic Party, usually self hypnotized by the beauties of his ego, 
never completely honest, manipulative, capable of any trick, betrayal, scam 
one can think of.
Yet he is the national bourgeoisie, as shaky as Chiang Kai Chek, and on site 
representative of the self promoting Tonto politics of the congressional 
black caucus, though there are a few exceptions. But the National 
Bourgeoisie for all its weak wavering dishonest compromise is a flawed but 
actual representative of "Home Rule", a very weak example of this city's 
Self Determination. That it is so weak must also raise questions of the 
weakness of Newark's would be revolutionaries.
Corey Booker, on the other hand, is a Comprador, straight out. He has raised 
earlier, 795,000 from Wall St. (See Star Ledger, NYTimes) and another 
400,000 from New Jersey suburbs! �Now that figure is nearly three million 
dollars! Including contributions from Goldman- Sachs Brokerage, Jack Kemp, 
the National Republican party, &amp;C . With over One Million dollars raised 
from Outside Newark,
It indicates that those are his true sponsors and backers.
In addition, Booker is an active Republican. Yes, the Republicans of Bush, 
Ashcroft, Thomas, Whitman, budget cuts, tax rebates to the corporations, 
Enron, World Trade Center suspiciousness, Afghanistan, Enablers of Sharon's 
Massacre Crusade of the Palestinians, Spy plane over China, Confederate 
Flag, Environmental Terror, Right wing election crooks, &amp;c &amp;C
Booker escorted �Bush 2's Spouse Laura, Republican Senate Candidate Bob 
Franks and the super rightist Gubernatorial candidate Bret Schundler through 
Newark. Booker backs Privatization, Charter Schools, the general Republican 
anti -working class anti -minority anti -immigrant , pro corpora-e Agenda. 
He is quite simply a Trojan horse for the Republican initiative to take 
Newark, now that they have been kicked out of Trenton.
For the people of Newark, a Republican victory would mean the Destruction of 
the Public School System, The Privatization of the businesses and resources 
that will come from the building of the Arena, the privatization of the 
entire so called Newark Renaissance. Ironically, when Booker claims to be 
calling for the benefits of this renaissance to be spread among the whole 
Newark Community not just for Downtown. We must realize Booker Is Downtown. 
A representative of Corporate Republican Interests . They are his Sponsors, 
not the people of Newark!
If Booker's Economic base is Right Wing Corporate , his social base is the 
suburban Yuppies and Buppies who form the majority of his staff. His triumph 
would mean the Elimination of 16,000 jobs from the City Hall Infra structure 
and staffs. These jobs would then be refilled by the suburban white Yuppie 
and Buppie Negro contingent, already easing in with NJPAC, and city hall's 
offices would become almost instantly "foreign" i.e., the other part of the 
middle management largely white college crowd who will also be the �staff 
for the new businesses coming into the city. The young folks who the new 
downtown condominiums are being built!
It is as simple as Home Rule Vs Foreign Domination. �Self Determination Vs 
Corporate Rule! Mao made a United Front with Chiang Kai Chek's Kuomintang 
against the Japanese Imperialists, but when the Japanese were defeated 
Chiang tried to destroy the Revolutionaries led by Mao , but were defeated 
and run out of China.
So that the clear task of Revolutionaries in Newark is to Elect Ras Baraka 
and Hector Corchado, not by copying the Opportunism of the bourgeois 
candidates but putting out a clear Revolutionary Democratic Line. E.g. 
DEMOCRACY &amp; SELF DETERMINATION- 1END STATE TAKEOVER OF EDUCATION-
2RESTORE NEWARK CITIZENS RIGHT TO SPEAK AT CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS- 3COMMUNITY 
CONTROL OF POLICE- 4REDUCE DRUGS AND CRIME BY MASSIVE CAMPAIGN FOR JOBS, 
EDUCATION AND RECREATION- 5 TO MAKE NEWARK'S "RENAISSANCE" CITY WIDE 
&amp;-REBUILD THE ECONOMY - STRESS COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF NEWARK, 
CITY &amp; STATE AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT, BIG AND SMALL BUSINESS, &amp; INSTITUTIONS 
&amp;C

If the Political Line is �clear &amp; strong enough and distributed broadly with 
the necessary outreach to the community , the grass roots and indigenous 
people of Newark, Ras Baraka's Campaign, as well as the Baraka-Corchado 
Black-Latino Unity ticket, �will be successful. �But the Campaign must be an 
example of Revolutionary Democratic Organization and Mobilization not just 
career building with the present campaign, but as a method of Organizing the 
whole working class for the broader struggle against Imperialism &amp; National 
Oppression. Against War and Rising Fascism!
True Revolutionaries cannot turn their backs on the need to defeat the Right 
Wing Assault. But certainly, Booker will be back in 2006, some analysts 
think that is his real battlefield. That the present campaign is just 
advertising for the real Armageddon, �Booker's backers know that after the 
present Mayor is gone, the next candidate representing Newark's people might 
be an actual Revolutionary.

&gt;both parties attending and "stress[ing] their credentials as friends of
&gt;Israel." This group included DEMOCRAT Tom Daschle, the Senate majority
&gt;leader. While protesters circled the hotel, a banquet was being held inside
&gt;that drew half the Senators, nearly 100 representatives and 26 
&gt;ambassadors."
&gt;(NYT, Wed., April 24).That's Democrats and Republicans, Joe. So, on which
&gt;side does your raggedy line place you?
&gt;
&gt;The House is now about to consider (again) a resolution expressing support
&gt;for Israel and condemning Arafat's "terrorism." Two years ago, Congressman
&gt;Pascrell, who I'm running against, supported a similar resolution, causing
&gt;widespread outrage in the Arab community in Paterson and a demonstration
&gt;outside his office in Paterson. Again, which side are you on?
&gt;
&gt;Also, your email exposes that you measure success by the amount of votes 
&gt;you
&gt;get in losing causes, as in New Brunswick. In that race, you clothed your
&gt;program with the language of "seizing power." Explain to me how you will
&gt;"seize power" this way, even if you win a local office? No, your line 
&gt;merely
&gt;builds illusion. The Greens believe in running for local office and have
&gt;acheived two electoral victories in New Jersey with our line, in Califon 
&gt;and
&gt;in Rutherford. Our outlook is that we need to build an INDEPENDENT 
&gt;political
&gt;movement...independent of both corporate-controlled parties.
&gt;
&gt;Have fun supporting the Democrats. Enjoy it while you can because the
&gt;movement is going to march right past your reactionary political line and
&gt;leave it on the dung heap of history.

<pre>Hey Joe,

If you're planning on being a full-time cheerleader for the Democrats
I have a few suggestions for you.

First, join the CP-USA... they've been at it far longer than you. 
Maybe they could give you some pointers in mainstream brown-nosing.

Second, Clinton bombed Yugoslavia, Sudan, and Iraq, expanded NATO,
raised the military budget, and repealed welfare.  Do you have some
reason to believe that his Democratic successor would have an
agenda that differed in the least bit in its goals than, as you
affectionately refer to him, "Bush 2"?

The ends are the same.  I prefer the "honesty" of the Bush 
administration, because at least it is doing its part to mobilize
and unite the opposition, instead of the bastards sitting at home
wondering why the "progressive" president they have elected is 
doing such nasty things.

Someday, you will join your brother in working for some government
floozy (if you're very, very lucky), and the angst that drives your 
politics will subside.  Those people whose convictions are based on 
their moral fiber, and not on post-adolescent anomie, will continue 
to build their organizations.  Not with instant self-gratification 
in mind, but with the thought of a more just and free society for 
their children and grandchildren if not for themselves.

I'm hoping you will unravel sooner than later.  You have polluted
this list and, indeed, the activist community with your hare-brained
rants for long enough.

<pre>N.Y. revue to spotlight Rutgers students

Friday, April 26, 2002

BY BETTE SPERO
Star-Ledger Staff

Whatever Rutgers University's students at the Mason Gross School of the Arts 
in New Brunswick may accomplish in their show business careers, some soon 
can put a Broadway credit at the top of their r�sum�s.

On Sunday, Mason Gross students, along with fellow thespians from
alumni to professors, will present "Rutgers on Broadway" at the Majestic 
Theater in New York.

Their stage setting augurs well -- it's where "The Phantom of the Opera" 
plays (except on Sundays, that
show's day off).

"It's pretty exciting acting on a Broadway stage for the first time,"
says Michael Sorvino, 24, a Mason Gross graduate last year. "I hope it
isn't the last time I act on Broadway."

Sorvino, a Tenafly native, attended Mason Gross at the suggestion of
his father: actor Paul Sorvino. The elder Sorvino studied in New York
with acting coach William Esper, who has taught theater at Rutgers
for the past 25 years.

"It's a straightforward, truly usable acting program -- not a lot of 
baloney," says Michael Sorvino. "You get 'a good box of tools' and come out 
of there knowing how to work. The curriculum is comprehensive, everything 
from stage combat to stage management."

Sorvino said he leaned toward performing an original comic monologue on 
Sunday. He and a Mason Gross classmate, Ivan Sanchez, co-wrote a one-act 
play, "Coffee," for their senior project. "There's a novella in me 
somewhere," says Sorvino.

Esper is directing about 25 Mason Gross students in the 90-minute program of 
scenes from various plays and films. Rain Denise Wilson, who's receiving a 
master's degree in acting from Mason Gross on May 23, is one of them.

Wilson played Titania, queen of the fairies, in Shakespeare's "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream," which Esper staged at Rutgers this season. At the Majestic, 
she will perform a dramatic scene from the film, "Losing Isaiah," and a 
romantic scene from the play, "Jelly's Last Jam."

The actress, a Chicago native in her 20s, describes the master's program at 
Mason Gross as "three long, intense, beautiful years."

"This was the right place," she says. "After coming here, I'm so much more 
ready to get on with the business of acting. Can you imagine starting a 
career on Broadway?"

Esper says he's confident Rutgers fans would fill the 1,500-seat Majestic.

"We're adaptable," he says. "A lot of friends will be in the audience."

Alumni on stage will vary from Kristin Davis, a 1987 graduate who acts in 
the television show "Sex and the City," to Terrell Tilford, a 1998 graduate 
who played David Grant on the CBS daytime drama, "Guiding Light."

Avery Brooks, an illustrious Mason Gross alumnus and teacher, will act a 
scene from "Paul Robeson," Phillip Hayes Dean's drama about another famous 
Rutgers graduate. Brooks did the play in the 1980s at Crossroads Theatre 
Company in New Brunswick and on Broadway.

Brooks' television acting has ranged from playing Hawk on "Spenser: For 
Hire" (with the late Robert Urich) and "A Man Called Hawk" in the 1980s to 
portraying Commander Benjamin Sisko on "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" in the 
1990s.

George B. Stauffer, dean of Mason Gross, began the practice last year of 
spotlighting Rutgers arts students annually in prestigious professional 
settings in New York. Then, the school's music students gave a sold-out 
concert in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center.

"Our musicians performed for a packed house. They were a smashing success," 
says Stauffer. "We're equally optimistic this year. This is a chance to see 
future stars of stage and screen begin their professional careers and to 
celebrate artists who already are successful."

&gt;
&gt;Your tone and approach are not to be put aside!
&gt;Surely you can't tell me that being rude and
&gt;condescending and abusive is a way to rally support for
&gt;Baraka!.  Especially to people who have said they are
&gt;supporting him!   Surely you can't be that unintelligent.
&gt;
&gt;What needs to be most exposed right now are the  flukes and
&gt;agent provacatuers masquarading around as champions of the people
&gt;whereas their main objective is to cause disharmony and disunity among
&gt;progressive forces where ever they go!
&gt;
&gt;We must remember that there are those who will do anything
&gt;to sabotage the current civil rights and progressive movement
&gt;that is amassing.   And they will use any and all means necessary.
&gt;
&gt;And that includes getting people to pretend they are for
&gt;a progressive movement, but whose actions demonstrate
&gt;that they are only trying to destroy it.
&gt;
&gt;I don't believe for one minute that Joe Smith is supporting
&gt;Ras Baraka!   Only one thing can result from his
&gt;actions -- sabotaging the Baraka campaign.  And that is
&gt;all that his actions are attempting to do!
&gt;He continuously berates any progressive person and any progressive
&gt;group that he can.   And he does this in the Baraka name.
&gt;He is intentionally setting out to disrupt the relationship that POP
&gt;and others have with the Barakas.
&gt;
&gt;POP has worked very closely and very well with the Baraka family
&gt;for a very long time.   (Even more specifically Larry Hamm has.  And I
&gt;might add he's been working with them long before Smith ever came along.)
&gt;I have had many opportunities to hear Ras Baraka speak and he has
&gt;never treated people in the condescending manner that Smith has.
&gt;
&gt;How can you talk about contributing to a people's movement when you
&gt;don't respect PEOPLE? ? ?  DUH?????  You even had the audacity to
&gt;belittle the Faison issue.
&gt;
&gt;Let me remind you of one thing!   You didn't create Baraka!  He and
&gt;his family are the products of Newark!   They are the products of the
&gt;heart, the soul, the spirit, the pain and the life blood of the people
&gt;of Newark and its surrounding communities!   Although I recognize
&gt;that people have been suffering all throughout NJ,  but the progessive
&gt;and civil rights movement in NJ was borne out of Newark!  You are simply
&gt;tailgating off of that!  That's all!
&gt;
&gt;And now you are supposedly inspired enough to come out
&gt;of New Brunswick and to tell  "the Negros" in Newark
&gt;what we should be doing.  You made repeated
&gt;references to "Negros" and "Coloreds" in another of your e-mails.
&gt;You even made a comment about  "whining Negros"
&gt;Quite frankly, I find your using this word
&gt;extremely disdainful.
&gt;
&gt;As you are completely lacking in social skills, let me
&gt;educate you about something.  There are certain unwritten
&gt;social rules.   People within a group will
&gt;make references to themselves in a certain way
&gt;that is acceptable only if you are a member of
&gt;the group.  When people outside of the group make
&gt;those same references about the same group,
&gt;the references have a completely different connotation
&gt;and are unacceptable.
&gt;A White person making a reference about a "redneck"
&gt;has a completely different connotation then when
&gt;a Black person uses the word "redneck."  I've been
&gt;among Italian people, Jewish people, Homosexual people, etc.
&gt;that referred to themselves in ways that I understood
&gt;I could never do because I am not a member of
&gt;that group.
&gt;
&gt;I understood and respected that.  In my e-mails to you
&gt;I never once used any word that anyone would construe
&gt;as being racially offensive.  And neither has anyone
&gt;else on this list serve for that matter.    I don't know where you get
&gt;off thinking you can use any word you like when referring
&gt;to people within a certain ethnic group.  You are not African American
&gt;and you are not on the front line of any of our causes!
&gt;Are you getting my point here?  Are you getting my
&gt;message on this one?
&gt;
&gt;Futhermore, if you were so inspired by the message of Baraka,
&gt;why aren't you in your own community creating candidates to run?
&gt;In the Burbs of New Brunswick, Princeton, East Brunswick, etc.?
&gt;Or better yet, instead of ranting about Newark, why don't you go to South
&gt;Jersey
&gt;and do that?   Why don't you start by earning a sandwich doing
&gt;work in your own community?
&gt;
&gt;That's what NBPC needs to do!   DO THAT!
&gt;RAISE YOUR OWN CANDIDATES IN YOUR OWN
&gt;COMMUNITIES!   Now that would be progressive.
&gt;Did you ever go into South Jersey and try to register a 1000 voters
&gt;and convert them to your way of thinking?  ? ?  I doubt it!
&gt;(Personally I doubt that you even did that in Newark)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And as far as telling POP what to do, I have a little difficulty with
&gt;someone telling POP what to do who never has supported POP and
&gt;has never come to a POP meeting.
&gt;
&gt;If you were of any substance and if you intended for your
&gt;so called proposal to have any merit, you would come and speak to POP
&gt;at a meeting face to face with its members and present your proposal
&gt;and your criticisms (or at least your so-called proposal).  Many people
&gt;and organizations have done that.   POP has always been opened
&gt;to people doing that.
&gt;
&gt;No, but you chose not to because your true intentions are not
&gt;to rally support for Baraka at all!  Your actions speak much louder
&gt;than your loud and abusive rantings!
&gt;
&gt;And your spiel about the democratic party and greens are
&gt;so tired.  Your bottom so-called revolutionary message is
&gt;vote democrat regardless of who the candidate is and how horrible
&gt;he has been!    GIVE ME  A BREAK.  That's revolutionary
&gt;way of thinking is stupefying.
&gt;
&gt;One more thing, I am not going to waste any more words or
&gt;breath on you!  Rather, I will put my efforts toward making sure
&gt;that every condescending e-mail that you have sent and will send
&gt;goes to the Baraka camp and his supporters within different
&gt;groups such as the Black Nia Force and the NBPP.
&gt;I think people need to be made fully
&gt;aware of the tactics that people are using in the Baraka name that can
&gt;only harm his campaign.   And your actions show how
&gt;that is your true intention.

&gt; &gt; socialism, that we in new jersey can accomplish, then getting

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; debby, it is definitely not my "job" to look up directions, drive over,

&gt; &gt; struggle for democracy!! that is what the baraka campaign represents; an
&gt; &gt; advance on behalf of the international peoples forces in the struggle 
&gt;for
&gt; &gt; democracy. all those marching in DC did great, but a stronger show of
&gt; &gt; international solidarity is to seize these local governments &amp; our 
&gt;cities
&gt; &gt; institutions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; what does that mean "leave it alone, let it be"?
&gt; &gt; it is POP's organizational DUTY to support &amp; elect ras baraka (as an
&gt; &gt; organization! not individuals!), anything less is a betrayal of those
&gt; &gt; struggling right along side you. so no debby, NBPC will not let it be &amp; 
&gt;we
&gt; &gt; will not leave it alone. we will criticize &amp; expose what we see as 
&gt;mistakes
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; in POP &amp; any other organization that claims to represent the people, in
&gt; &gt; order to advance our collective struggle.

&gt;
&gt;Adherents of the Democrats are free to say what they want about their 
&gt;party.
&gt;What they may not do is claim their devotion to it amounts to Marxism.
&gt;
&gt;Let us look at U&amp;S' statement, "The Trojan Horse," about this year's Newark
&gt;municipal election. It begins with this:
&gt;
&gt;Communists &amp; REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATS understand that there can be no
&gt;socialist revolution without the completion of the Democratic Revolution.
&gt;(See Lenin, Mao)"
&gt;
&gt;The more important thing is unsaid: there is no democracy for the working
&gt;class and the oppressed nationalities without revolution. (That was what
&gt;Lenin and Mao were about.) The posture of democracy first, then socialism,
&gt;is consistent throughout. It amounts to reformism, not Marxism.
&gt;
&gt;The antics of "Black &amp; Latino Bourgeois Democratic politicians" in New York
&gt;and Los Angeles are described as "betrayal" of the principle of 
&gt;Black-Latino
&gt;unity. They're not betraying their bourgeois "principles" of anything. The
&gt;principle of multinational unity only has meaning for the oppressed on a
&gt;working class basis. Nowhere in this piece is the class content of the
&gt;principle explained.
&gt;
&gt;A list of Cory Booker's sins is described to prove he is--a Republican! The
&gt;problem is that everything on the list is typical as well of Democrats,
&gt;like, um . . . Cory Booker. The real Trojan horse against the people isn't
&gt;just Booker, it's the whole Democratic Party. Sharpe James is also a
&gt;Democrat. Why is he an alternative?
&gt;
&gt;The paper's assessment of Sharpe is accurate enough. The difference comes
&gt;down to his wispy national bourgeois aspects. These mean absolutely nothing
&gt;without the political self-activity of the masses. To put this unwarranted
&gt;emphasis on James is outright subjection to bourgeois leadership. U&amp;S must
&gt;also be taxed with Joseph Smith's demands (don't try to disavow him, U&amp;S!)
&gt;that other groups should drop their own activities, like the May 15
&gt;Statewide March Against Police Brutality, in favor of Newark election
&gt;activity.
&gt;
&gt;The piece supports Ras Baraka's campaign. That is a different matter from
&gt;James. A comparison is made with the united front against Japanese
&gt;imperialism of the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang party of the
&gt;landlords and capitalists. The problem here is the piece doesn't justify 
&gt;the
&gt;comparison. (Mao said political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
&gt;That's exactly how the Communists later ran the Kuomintang out of
&gt;continental China.)
&gt;
&gt;A number of "revolutionary democratic" program points are put forth. They
&gt;are only revolutionary if put forth as class struggle. For example, the
&gt;program of community control of the police is only revolutionary if aimed 
&gt;at
&gt;ending the armed rule of the bourgeoisie over the ruling class.
&gt;
&gt;Even so, no democratic program is in and of itself revolutionary. The
&gt;democratic program is necessary to revolution, but not sufficient. The
&gt;bourgeois state can never be overthrow by purely democratic means. To 
&gt;forget
&gt;this is to forget Marxism and fall into reformism.
&gt;
&gt;Nowhere does the paper's discussion of mass organization go beyond
&gt;bourgeois-legal means. Most importantly, the need for a new and genuine
&gt;Communist Party to lead the working class and the oppressed to proletarian
&gt;revolution is ignored.
&gt;
&gt;Although this piece on its own makes almost no case for Ras, I hope to see
&gt;him elected. Neither the stifling 1970 Old Guard nor the downtown/Booker 
&gt;New
&gt;Guard have anything to offer the great majority of Newark's residents. Ras
&gt;will bring a new voice, he will raise considerable interest in the
&gt;community. The only real test of what he can do with a seat on the Council
&gt;will be what happens when he gets one.

&gt; &gt; UNITY &amp; STRUGGLE BULLETIN 4 /19/02
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The Trojan Horse
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Communists &amp; REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATS understand that there can be
&gt; &gt; no socialist revolution without the completion of the Democratic
&gt;Revolution.
&gt; &gt; (See Lenin, Mao). They also know that the Revolutionaries must take the
&gt;lead
&gt; &gt; in the completion of a Democratic Revolution and even when utilizing the
&gt; &gt; bourgeois instrument of Electoral Politics, must use it to forward the
&gt; &gt; themes, the political lines, the ideological clarity of the 
&gt;revolutionary
&gt; &gt; leaders of the Working Class.
&gt; &gt; For these reasons Revolutionaries running in bourgeois elections never
&gt; &gt; consider Only their own candidacy, but take in to consideration the
&gt;critical
&gt; &gt; needs and issues of the working class. If they narrow their view to
&gt;consider
&gt; &gt; Only their own election to a seat, and do not put out the issues and
&gt;themes
&gt; &gt; that affect the whole working class, then they have become somewhat
&gt; &gt; politically retarded so that their "insurgency" is reduced to the narrow
&gt; &gt; career considerations of the petty bourgeois democrat !
&gt; &gt; In the Newark elections of May 14, Ras Baraka and in the alliance with 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; Puerto Rican north ward candidate, Hector Corchado, are without a doubt
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; most progressive force in the election. The very political strength and
&gt; &gt; democratic leadership that their alliance has projected "Black-Latino
&gt;Unity"
&gt; &gt; draws the entire mass base of the grassroots constituency together, in
&gt; &gt; defiance of the bogus "teams" both mayoral candidates have projected 
&gt;which
&gt; &gt; excludes both Baraka and Corchado.
&gt; &gt; This theme is especially relevant and necessary because of the betrayals
&gt;to
&gt; &gt; this unity which were demonstrated in the New York City and Los Angeles
&gt; &gt; Mayoral contests where Black &amp; Latino Bourgeois Democratic politicians
&gt; &gt; sabotaged that unity so that both Latino Mayoral candidates were 
&gt;defeated
&gt; &gt; and so called "moderate" whites were elected. Bloomberg in NYC spent 59
&gt; &gt; million and bought colored quislings on the spot. Hahn in LA using the
&gt;beard
&gt; &gt; of his father's bravery in meeting Dr. King at the airport, and his palm
&gt; &gt; greasing of Negro politicians, zig zagged his way into office, and upon
&gt; &gt; being elected immediately announced that he was firing the Black Police
&gt; &gt; Chief. Now the Negroes are whining, betrayal. But it was their betrayal
&gt; &gt; which allowed Hahn's.
&gt; &gt; In Newark, some people believe that as long as they vote for RAS BARAKA
&gt;and
&gt; &gt; HECTOR CORCHADO, they have fulfilled their progressive obligations so 
&gt;that
&gt; &gt; they can covertly vote for the Wall St Trojan Horse, Corey Booker. But
&gt;this
&gt; &gt; is simply a failure to closely examine and analyze the entire meaning of
&gt; &gt; this campaign.
&gt; &gt; On one hand you have Sharpe James, in public office since the 
&gt;Community's
&gt; &gt; Choice Campaign of 1970. He is part of the Afro American National
&gt; &gt; Bourgeoisie. Always compromising with Corporate Capital, usually shaky 
&gt;in
&gt; &gt; confronting the big dogs of government and business. an important
&gt;operative
&gt; &gt; in the Democratic Party, usually self hypnotized by the beauties of his
&gt;ego,
&gt; &gt; never completely honest, manipulative, capable of any trick, betrayal,
&gt;scam
&gt; &gt; one can think of.
&gt; &gt; Yet he is the national bourgeoisie, as shaky as Chiang Kai Chek, and on
&gt;site
&gt; &gt; representative of the self promoting Tonto politics of the congressional
&gt; &gt; black caucus, though there are a few exceptions. But the National
&gt; &gt; Bourgeoisie for all its weak wavering dishonest compromise is a flawed 
&gt;but
&gt; &gt; actual representative of "Home Rule", a very weak example of this city's
&gt; &gt; Self Determination. That it is so weak must also raise questions of the
&gt; &gt; weakness of Newark's would be revolutionaries.
&gt; &gt; Corey Booker, on the other hand, is a Comprador, straight out. He has
&gt;raised
&gt; &gt; earlier, 795,000 from Wall St. (See Star Ledger, NYTimes) and another
&gt; &gt; 400,000 from New Jersey suburbs! Now that figure is nearly three million
&gt; &gt; dollars! Including contributions from Goldman- Sachs Brokerage, Jack 
&gt;Kemp,
&gt; &gt; the National Republican party, &amp;C . With over One Million dollars raised
&gt; &gt; from Outside Newark,
&gt; &gt; It indicates that those are his true sponsors and backers.
&gt; &gt; In addition, Booker is an active Republican. Yes, the Republicans of 
&gt;Bush,
&gt; &gt; Ashcroft, Thomas, Whitman, budget cuts, tax rebates to the corporations,
&gt; &gt; Enron, World Trade Center suspiciousness, Afghanistan, Enablers of
&gt;Sharon's
&gt; &gt; Massacre Crusade of the Palestinians, Spy plane over China, Confederate
&gt; &gt; Flag, Environmental Terror, Right wing election crooks, &amp;c &amp;C
&gt; &gt; Booker escorted Bush 2's Spouse Laura, Republican Senate Candidate Bob
&gt; &gt; Franks and the super rightist Gubernatorial candidate Bret Schundler
&gt;through
&gt; &gt; Newark. Booker backs Privatization, Charter Schools, the general
&gt;Republican
&gt; &gt; anti -working class anti -minority anti -immigrant , pro corpora-e 
&gt;Agenda.
&gt; &gt; He is quite simply a Trojan horse for the Republican initiative to take
&gt; &gt; Newark, now that they have been kicked out of Trenton.
&gt; &gt; For the people of Newark, a Republican victory would mean the 
&gt;Destruction
&gt;of
&gt; &gt; the Public School System, The Privatization of the businesses and
&gt;resources
&gt; &gt; that will come from the building of the Arena, the privatization of the
&gt; &gt; entire so called Newark Renaissance. Ironically, when Booker claims to 
&gt;be
&gt; &gt; calling for the benefits of this renaissance to be spread among the 
&gt;whole
&gt; &gt; Newark Community not just for Downtown. We must realize Booker Is
&gt;Downtown.
&gt; &gt; A representative of Corporate Republican Interests . They are his
&gt;Sponsors,
&gt; &gt; not the people of Newark!
&gt; &gt; If Booker's Economic base is Right Wing Corporate , his social base is 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; suburban Yuppies and Buppies who form the majority of his staff. His
&gt;triumph
&gt; &gt; would mean the Elimination of 16,000 jobs from the City Hall Infra
&gt;structure
&gt; &gt; and staffs. These jobs would then be refilled by the suburban white 
&gt;Yuppie
&gt; &gt; and Buppie Negro contingent, already easing in with NJPAC, and city 
&gt;hall's
&gt; &gt; offices would become almost instantly "foreign" i.e., the other part of
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; middle management largely white college crowd who will also be the staff
&gt; &gt; for the new businesses coming into the city. The young folks who the new
&gt; &gt; downtown condominiums are being built!
&gt; &gt; It is as simple as Home Rule Vs Foreign Domination. Self Determination 
&gt;Vs
&gt; &gt; Corporate Rule! Mao made a United Front with Chiang Kai Chek's 
&gt;Kuomintang
&gt; &gt; against the Japanese Imperialists, but when the Japanese were defeated
&gt; &gt; Chiang tried to destroy the Revolutionaries led by Mao , but were 
&gt;defeated
&gt; &gt; and run out of China.
&gt; &gt; So that the clear task of Revolutionaries in Newark is to Elect Ras 
&gt;Baraka
&gt; &gt; and Hector Corchado, not by copying the Opportunism of the bourgeois
&gt; &gt; candidates but putting out a clear Revolutionary Democratic Line. E.g.
&gt; &gt; DEMOCRACY &amp; SELF DETERMINATION- 1END STATE TAKEOVER OF EDUCATION-
&gt; &gt; 2RESTORE NEWARK CITIZENS RIGHT TO SPEAK AT CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS-
&gt;3COMMUNITY
&gt; &gt; CONTROL OF POLICE- 4REDUCE DRUGS AND CRIME BY MASSIVE CAMPAIGN FOR JOBS,
&gt; &gt; EDUCATION AND RECREATION- 5 TO MAKE NEWARK'S "RENAISSANCE" CITY WIDE
&gt; &gt; &amp;-REBUILD THE ECONOMY - STRESS COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF NEWARK,
&gt; &gt; CITY &amp; STATE AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT, BIG AND SMALL BUSINESS, &amp; 
&gt;INSTITUTIONS
&gt; &gt; &amp;C
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If the Political Line is clear &amp; strong enough and distributed broadly
&gt;with
&gt; &gt; the necessary outreach to the community , the grass roots and indigenous
&gt; &gt; people of Newark, Ras Baraka's Campaign, as well as the Baraka-Corchado
&gt; &gt; Black-Latino Unity ticket, will be successful. But the Campaign must be 
&gt;an
&gt; &gt; example of Revolutionary Democratic Organization and Mobilization not 
&gt;just
&gt; &gt; career building with the present campaign, but as a method of Organizing
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; whole working class for the broader struggle against Imperialism &amp;
&gt;National
&gt; &gt; Oppression. Against War and Rising Fascism!
&gt; &gt; True Revolutionaries cannot turn their backs on the need to defeat the
&gt;Right
&gt; &gt; Wing Assault. But certainly, Booker will be back in 2006, some analysts
&gt; &gt; think that is his real battlefield. That the present campaign is just
&gt; &gt; advertising for the real Armageddon, Booker's backers know that after 
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; present Mayor is gone, the next candidate representing Newark's people
&gt;might
&gt; &gt; be an actual Revolutionary.

<pre>i must express serious issue with matthew and U&amp;S.
mistakes2000 can be turned into strengths 2002. people should read this to 
understand


-*-for those that make it through this message... the anti-republican bloc 
of the new brunswick peoples campaign was expelled in may, 2 weeks after the 
convention2000. we were thrown out by U&amp;S among others &amp; were only 
reinstated by our own efforts to organize in the community - which paid off 
in august of 2001, which is when we formally endorsed ras. U&amp;S expelled the 
anti-republican bloc of the new brunswick peoples campaign2000 &amp; didn't even 
criticize themselves until that position became impossible to reconcile with 
the anti-republican bloc's pressure for an U&amp;S issue to be out for last 
year's March ON Trenton.-*-

i will begin with this section -

&gt;Also, Dave should really be ashamed of this tactic of trying to use the
&gt;negative emotions from a recent feud between Joe Smith and POP as an anchor
&gt;to tie around Amiri Baraka's neck: "U&amp;S [read: Amiri] must also be taxed
&gt;with Joseph Smith's demands (don't try to disavow him, U&amp;S!)" In what way
&gt;should U&amp;S be "taxed", Collector?

your tax is putting out the next U&amp;S issue, or should we wait until after 
the election for that too!


&gt;This is really cynical and actually
&gt;repeats &amp; intensifies the mistake that Joe has apparently made, which is
&gt;while boasting to be "The Most Revolutionary Dude in the Hood" the actual
&gt;result is sowing seeds of divisiveness (intented or not) at a critical time
&gt;in the struggle for political power between a peoples' organization and
&gt;tried-and-true revolutionaries *from* the hood.

1. what does "apparently" mean?

2. why are there quotes around "The Most Revolutionary Dude in the Hood"    
where is the origin of these
    words

(answers are expected in such an order so that the answer answers the 
question.
maybe begin each answer with the question, ie. " Apparently means...")

3. does U&amp;S not understand that the "divisiveness" is already here? this 
conversation wouldn't be
    happening if NBPC didn't point out the fact that POP the organization is 
not working with the committee to
    elect baraka. how can U&amp;S allow matthew to slander me - in an effort to 
lay the "seeds of divisiveness" at
    my feet???

^^^ 2 questions ^^^
now matthew will elaborate, let's pay very close attention.

&gt;This last point is worth elaborating on, because the struggle is for
&gt;political power ultimately.  It is worth noting how Amiri's line differs
&gt;from Dave's *in practice*....In working to building Ras' City Council
&gt;campaign (shit, in working to raise &amp; build Ras!) Amiri, Amina, all those
&gt;toiling on the campaign trail, are fighting for a step foward in advancing
&gt;the Democratic Revolution and setting the stage for a future socialist
&gt;transformation.  (and yes, use James--who is himself a co-opted product of
&gt;Home Rule and the struggle for self-determination--as a shield to maneuver.
&gt;absolutely.  To do otherwise is unintelligent).

when discussing politics with an educated voter -  "to do otherwise is 
unintelligent". ok
when discussing politics with a proclaimed revolutionary that puts forward a 
boycott position on the mayoral campaign of newark 2002, like 
hungerfraud/greens have done, "to do otherwise is nothing short of COUNTER 
REVOLUTIONARY." especially when said parties have resources like an 
organization of POP's ability.

&gt;This as opposed to Dave's
&gt;line which leads him to treat politics like religion where his clean hands
&gt;won't be tainted by the impurities of the beast: where he ends up 
&gt;supporting
&gt;token campaigns that are pure, but doomed to failure--the people can't
&gt;exploit contradictions in the ruling class because "there is *no democracy*
&gt;until after the revolution!!"  Dave said it, it must be so.

attention U&amp;S,
there is nothing "pure" about campaigns that are "doomed to failure", unless 
you are talking to a voter that ~ followed their heart ~ ... but if you are 
talking to proclaimed revolutionaries, "doomed to failure" political 
campaigns are what we need to ABANDONED IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!!!!
and that it is the "doomed" campaign - that steal resources away from the 
local independent movement - which are the RAKES of divisiness. do you 
concure?
or does U&amp;S really blame joe smith because the greens are backwards?


&gt;To all the Greens and Nadir supporters who may be offended by this by
&gt;implication: look around you and see what 15 months of Bush/Sharon has
&gt;brought the world.  It is entirely necessary to learn from--&amp; not
&gt;repeat--the mistakes of 2000 national elections.

it is entirely necessary to learn from--&amp; not repeat--the mistakes of 2000 
national elections
^^this should be on bumper stickers across the nation^^

&gt;The point is not-and never
&gt;was-how strong or weak Gore's candidacy was.  And to have been "let down" 
&gt;by
&gt;his weaknesses only betrays secret hope that the democrats might represent
&gt;your interests....The point--which U&amp;S among many others made relentlessly
&gt;pre-2000 election--is that we needed desperately to hold back what
&gt;Bush/Cheney obviously represented: the seizing of national power by
&gt;Far-Right/American Fascist/Oil-Fueled madness &amp; all out War to make the 
&gt;Arab
&gt;world an oil plantation, which we see unfolding in all its devestating fury
&gt;by the minute; to exploit the contradictions in the ruling class.

it is an entire lie for U&amp;S to allow matthew to state - "The point--U&amp;S 
among others made relentlessly pre-2000 election--is that we needed 
desperately to hold back what bush/cheney..."

1. there was no U&amp;S pre-2000 election. matthew will rescind this statement &amp; 
he will admit that U&amp;S did
    not go to print because it sat in his computer. why? because U&amp;S made an 
alliance with local
    republicans&amp;greens down in new brunswick. keith joseph, along w/ matt an 
editor of U&amp;S, was a nbpc
    candidate for council that registered with the republican party along 
with the majority of nbpc members in
    exchange for all the fruits that come to those that register republican.

2. there was no U&amp;S pre-2000 election. amiri will rescind this statement 
made by matthew &amp; he will admit
    that U&amp;S did not go to print because it sat in matthew's computer. why? 
because how could U&amp;S attack
    bush&amp;nadir in a national election and get republicans&amp;greens to support 
keith joseph's/nbpc city council
    campaign at the same time?

3. U&amp;S is just as responsible for bush2 as the greens. they are coming to 
realize this more and more by
     the minute. &amp; it was more cripiling to the local movement the way they 
did it.

4. there is a history of U&amp;S and the lack of publication during election 
campaigns. and this history
    continues -- FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO U&amp;S NEWSPAPERS, YET 
THERE IS AN
    ELECTION.

&gt;To
&gt;continue to argue in defense of Nadir's ill-advised presidential campaign 
&gt;at
&gt;this time is absurd, and really the result of middle class delusions that
&gt;you can "Run the system better" as Ralph himself said, even recently on
&gt;'Hardcopy' (across from his "friend" Buchanon!!).  Again, the difference in
&gt;lines with Baraka, and what I embrace, is the model of struggling for
&gt;political power &amp; self-determination from the ground up: the model today is
&gt;Ras Baraka's campaign for revolutionary democracy.

for matthew to be doing anything before putting out a new issue of U&amp;S is 
just as absurd.


&gt;With that, I look foward to seeing many POP members out on the campaign
&gt;trail between now and May 14, &amp; I trust that many that I do not see are
&gt;working in their own way to spread the word, and bring out the vote.
&gt;This one's for real!

i would love to see the organization of POP working with the committee to 
elect ras baraka  &amp; pushing back the march on trenton. i expect all 
supporters of ras &amp; revolutionaries in POP will embrace this proposal. -joe

&gt;
&gt;Adherents of the Democrats are free to say what they want about their 
&gt;party.
&gt;What they may not do is claim their devotion to it amounts to Marxism.
&gt;
&gt;Let us look at U&amp;S' statement, "The Trojan Horse," about this year's Newark
&gt;municipal election. It begins with this:
&gt;
&gt;Communists &amp; REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATS understand that there can be no
&gt;socialist revolution without the completion of the Democratic Revolution.
&gt;(See Lenin, Mao)"
&gt;
&gt;The more important thing is unsaid: there is no democracy for the working
&gt;class and the oppressed nationalities without revolution. (That was what
&gt;Lenin and Mao were about.) The posture of democracy first, then socialism,
&gt;is consistent throughout. It amounts to reformism, not Marxism.
&gt;
&gt;The antics of "Black &amp; Latino Bourgeois Democratic politicians" in New York
&gt;and Los Angeles are described as "betrayal" of the principle of 
&gt;Black-Latino
&gt;unity. They're not betraying their bourgeois "principles" of anything. The
&gt;principle of multinational unity only has meaning for the oppressed on a
&gt;working class basis. Nowhere in this piece is the class content of the
&gt;principle explained.
&gt;
&gt;A list of Cory Booker's sins is described to prove he is--a Republican! The
&gt;problem is that everything on the list is typical as well of Democrats,
&gt;like, um . . . Cory Booker. The real Trojan horse against the people isn't
&gt;just Booker, it's the whole Democratic Party. Sharpe James is also a
&gt;Democrat. Why is he an alternative?
&gt;
&gt;The paper's assessment of Sharpe is accurate enough. The difference comes
&gt;down to his wispy national bourgeois aspects. These mean absolutely nothing
&gt;without the political self-activity of the masses. To put this unwarranted
&gt;emphasis on James is outright subjection to bourgeois leadership. U&amp;S must
&gt;also be taxed with Joseph Smith's demands (don't try to disavow him, U&amp;S!)
&gt;that other groups should drop their own activities, like the May 15
&gt;Statewide March Against Police Brutality, in favor of Newark election
&gt;activity.
&gt;
&gt;The piece supports Ras Baraka's campaign. That is a different matter from
&gt;James. A comparison is made with the united front against Japanese
&gt;imperialism of the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang party of the
&gt;landlords and capitalists. The problem here is the piece doesn't justify 
&gt;the
&gt;comparison. (Mao said political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
&gt;That's exactly how the Communists later ran the Kuomintang out of
&gt;continental China.)
&gt;
&gt;A number of "revolutionary democratic" program points are put forth. They
&gt;are only revolutionary if put forth as class struggle. For example, the
&gt;program of community control of the police is only revolutionary if aimed 
&gt;at
&gt;ending the armed rule of the bourgeoisie over the ruling class.
&gt;
&gt;Even so, no democratic program is in and of itself revolutionary. The
&gt;democratic program is necessary to revolution, but not sufficient. The
&gt;bourgeois state can never be overthrow by purely democratic means. To 
&gt;forget
&gt;this is to forget Marxism and fall into reformism.
&gt;
&gt;Nowhere does the paper's discussion of mass organization go beyond
&gt;bourgeois-legal means. Most importantly, the need for a new and genuine
&gt;Communist Party to lead the working class and the oppressed to proletarian
&gt;revolution is ignored.
&gt;
&gt;Although this piece on its own makes almost no case for Ras, I hope to see
&gt;him elected. Neither the stifling 1970 Old Guard nor the downtown/Booker 
&gt;New
&gt;Guard have anything to offer the great majority of Newark's residents. Ras
&gt;will bring a new voice, he will raise considerable interest in the
&gt;community. The only real test of what he can do with a seat on the Council
&gt;will be what happens when he gets one.

&gt;  &gt; UNITY &amp; STRUGGLE BULLETIN 4 /19/02
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; The Trojan Horse
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Communists &amp; REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATS understand that there can be
&gt;  &gt; no socialist revolution without the completion of the Democratic
&gt;Revolution.
&gt;  &gt; (See Lenin, Mao). They also know that the Revolutionaries must take the
&gt;lead
&gt;  &gt; in the completion of a Democratic Revolution and even when utilizing 
&gt;the
&gt;  &gt; bourgeois instrument of Electoral Politics, must use it to forward the
&gt;  &gt; themes, the political lines, the ideological clarity of the 
&gt;revolutionary
&gt;  &gt; leaders of the Working Class.
&gt;  &gt; For these reasons Revolutionaries running in bourgeois elections never
&gt;  &gt; consider Only their own candidacy, but take in to consideration the
&gt;critical
&gt;  &gt; needs and issues of the working class. If they narrow their view to
&gt;consider
&gt;  &gt; Only their own election to a seat, and do not put out the issues and
&gt;themes
&gt;  &gt; that affect the whole working class, then they have become somewhat
&gt;  &gt; politically retarded so that their "insurgency" is reduced to the 
&gt;narrow
&gt;  &gt; career considerations of the petty bourgeois democrat !
&gt;  &gt; In the Newark elections of May 14, Ras Baraka and in the alliance with
&gt;the
&gt;  &gt; Puerto Rican north ward candidate, Hector Corchado, are without a doubt
&gt;the
&gt;  &gt; most progressive force in the election. The very political strength and
&gt;  &gt; democratic leadership that their alliance has projected "Black-Latino
&gt;Unity"
&gt;  &gt; draws the entire mass base of the grassroots constituency together, in
&gt;  &gt; defiance of the bogus "teams" both mayoral candidates have projected
&gt;which
&gt;  &gt; excludes both Baraka and Corchado.
&gt;  &gt; This theme is especially relevant and necessary because of the 
&gt;betrayals
&gt;to
&gt;  &gt; this unity which were demonstrated in the New York City and Los Angeles
&gt;  &gt; Mayoral contests where Black &amp; Latino Bourgeois Democratic politicians
&gt;  &gt; sabotaged that unity so that both Latino Mayoral candidates were 
&gt;defeated
&gt;  &gt; and so called "moderate" whites were elected. Bloomberg in NYC spent 59
&gt;  &gt; million and bought colored quislings on the spot. Hahn in LA using the
&gt;beard
&gt;  &gt; of his father's bravery in meeting Dr. King at the airport, and his 
&gt;palm
&gt;  &gt; greasing of Negro politicians, zig zagged his way into office, and upon
&gt;  &gt; being elected immediately announced that he was firing the Black Police
&gt;  &gt; Chief. Now the Negroes are whining, betrayal. But it was their betrayal
&gt;  &gt; which allowed Hahn's.
&gt;  &gt; In Newark, some people believe that as long as they vote for RAS BARAKA
&gt;and
&gt;  &gt; HECTOR CORCHADO, they have fulfilled their progressive obligations so
&gt;that
&gt;  &gt; they can covertly vote for the Wall St Trojan Horse, Corey Booker. But
&gt;this
&gt;  &gt; is simply a failure to closely examine and analyze the entire meaning 
&gt;of
&gt;  &gt; this campaign.
&gt;  &gt; On one hand you have Sharpe James, in public office since the 
&gt;Community's
&gt;  &gt; Choice Campaign of 1970. He is part of the Afro American National
&gt;  &gt; Bourgeoisie. Always compromising with Corporate Capital, usually shaky 
&gt;in
&gt;  &gt; confronting the big dogs of government and business. an important
&gt;operative
&gt;  &gt; in the Democratic Party, usually self hypnotized by the beauties of his
&gt;ego,
&gt;  &gt; never completely honest, manipulative, capable of any trick, betrayal,
&gt;scam
&gt;  &gt; one can think of.
&gt;  &gt; Yet he is the national bourgeoisie, as shaky as Chiang Kai Chek, and on
&gt;site
&gt;  &gt; representative of the self promoting Tonto politics of the 
&gt;congressional
&gt;  &gt; black caucus, though there are a few exceptions. But the National
&gt;  &gt; Bourgeoisie for all its weak wavering dishonest compromise is a flawed
&gt;but
&gt;  &gt; actual representative of "Home Rule", a very weak example of this 
&gt;city's
&gt;  &gt; Self Determination. That it is so weak must also raise questions of the
&gt;  &gt; weakness of Newark's would be revolutionaries.
&gt;  &gt; Corey Booker, on the other hand, is a Comprador, straight out. He has
&gt;raised
&gt;  &gt; earlier, 795,000 from Wall St. (See Star Ledger, NYTimes) and another
&gt;  &gt; 400,000 from New Jersey suburbs! Now that figure is nearly three 
&gt;million
&gt;  &gt; dollars! Including contributions from Goldman- Sachs Brokerage, Jack
&gt;Kemp,
&gt;  &gt; the National Republican party, &amp;C . With over One Million dollars 
&gt;raised
&gt;  &gt; from Outside Newark,
&gt;  &gt; It indicates that those are his true sponsors and backers.
&gt;  &gt; In addition, Booker is an active Republican. Yes, the Republicans of
&gt;Bush,
&gt;  &gt; Ashcroft, Thomas, Whitman, budget cuts, tax rebates to the 
&gt;corporations,
&gt;  &gt; Enron, World Trade Center suspiciousness, Afghanistan, Enablers of
&gt;Sharon's
&gt;  &gt; Massacre Crusade of the Palestinians, Spy plane over China, Confederate
&gt;  &gt; Flag, Environmental Terror, Right wing election crooks, &amp;c &amp;C
&gt;  &gt; Booker escorted Bush 2's Spouse Laura, Republican Senate Candidate Bob
&gt;  &gt; Franks and the super rightist Gubernatorial candidate Bret Schundler
&gt;through
&gt;  &gt; Newark. Booker backs Privatization, Charter Schools, the general
&gt;Republican
&gt;  &gt; anti -working class anti -minority anti -immigrant , pro corpora-e
&gt;Agenda.
&gt;  &gt; He is quite simply a Trojan horse for the Republican initiative to take
&gt;  &gt; Newark, now that they have been kicked out of Trenton.
&gt;  &gt; For the people of Newark, a Republican victory would mean the 
&gt;Destruction
&gt;of
&gt;  &gt; the Public School System, The Privatization of the businesses and
&gt;resources
&gt;  &gt; that will come from the building of the Arena, the privatization of the
&gt;  &gt; entire so called Newark Renaissance. Ironically, when Booker claims to 
&gt;be
&gt;  &gt; calling for the benefits of this renaissance to be spread among the 
&gt;whole
&gt;  &gt; Newark Community not just for Downtown. We must realize Booker Is
&gt;Downtown.
&gt;  &gt; A representative of Corporate Republican Interests . They are his
&gt;Sponsors,
&gt;  &gt; not the people of Newark!
&gt;  &gt; If Booker's Economic base is Right Wing Corporate , his social base is
&gt;the
&gt;  &gt; suburban Yuppies and Buppies who form the majority of his staff. His
&gt;triumph
&gt;  &gt; would mean the Elimination of 16,000 jobs from the City Hall Infra
&gt;structure
&gt;  &gt; and staffs. These jobs would then be refilled by the suburban white
&gt;Yuppie
&gt;  &gt; and Buppie Negro contingent, already easing in with NJPAC, and city
&gt;hall's
&gt;  &gt; offices would become almost instantly "foreign" i.e., the other part of
&gt;the
&gt;  &gt; middle management largely white college crowd who will also be the 
&gt;staff
&gt;  &gt; for the new businesses coming into the city. The young folks who the 
&gt;new
&gt;  &gt; downtown condominiums are being built!
&gt;  &gt; It is as simple as Home Rule Vs Foreign Domination. Self Determination 
&gt;Vs
&gt;  &gt; Corporate Rule! Mao made a United Front with Chiang Kai Chek's 
&gt;Kuomintang
&gt;  &gt; against the Japanese Imperialists, but when the Japanese were defeated
&gt;  &gt; Chiang tried to destroy the Revolutionaries led by Mao , but were
&gt;defeated
&gt;  &gt; and run out of China.
&gt;  &gt; So that the clear task of Revolutionaries in Newark is to Elect Ras
&gt;Baraka
&gt;  &gt; and Hector Corchado, not by copying the Opportunism of the bourgeois
&gt;  &gt; candidates but putting out a clear Revolutionary Democratic Line. E.g.
&gt;  &gt; DEMOCRACY &amp; SELF DETERMINATION- 1END STATE TAKEOVER OF EDUCATION-
&gt;  &gt; 2RESTORE NEWARK CITIZENS RIGHT TO SPEAK AT CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS-
&gt;3COMMUNITY
&gt;  &gt; CONTROL OF POLICE- 4REDUCE DRUGS AND CRIME BY MASSIVE CAMPAIGN FOR 
&gt;JOBS,
&gt;  &gt; EDUCATION AND RECREATION- 5 TO MAKE NEWARK'S "RENAISSANCE" CITY WIDE
&gt;  &gt; &amp;-REBUILD THE ECONOMY - STRESS COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF 
&gt;NEWARK,
&gt;  &gt; CITY &amp; STATE AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT, BIG AND SMALL BUSINESS, &amp;
&gt;INSTITUTIONS
&gt;  &gt; &amp;C
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; If the Political Line is clear &amp; strong enough and distributed broadly
&gt;with
&gt;  &gt; the necessary outreach to the community , the grass roots and 
&gt;indigenous
&gt;  &gt; people of Newark, Ras Baraka's Campaign, as well as the Baraka-Corchado
&gt;  &gt; Black-Latino Unity ticket, will be successful. But the Campaign must be
&gt;an
&gt;  &gt; example of Revolutionary Democratic Organization and Mobilization not
&gt;just
&gt;  &gt; career building with the present campaign, but as a method of 
&gt;Organizing
&gt;the
&gt;  &gt; whole working class for the broader struggle against Imperialism &amp;
&gt;National
&gt;  &gt; Oppression. Against War and Rising Fascism!
&gt;  &gt; True Revolutionaries cannot turn their backs on the need to defeat the
&gt;Right
&gt;  &gt; Wing Assault. But certainly, Booker will be back in 2006, some analysts
&gt;  &gt; think that is his real battlefield. That the present campaign is just
&gt;  &gt; advertising for the real Armageddon, Booker's backers know that after 
&gt;the
&gt;  &gt; present Mayor is gone, the next candidate representing Newark's people
&gt;might
&gt;  &gt; be an actual Revolutionary.

&gt;BTW, I attended the POP meeting tonight, where Ras came to try to repair 
&gt;the
&gt;damage that has been done. He explicitly disavowed the "lie" that POP has 
&gt;not
&gt;been supportive of his campaign. Also, I pledged the support of the Green
&gt;Party for the Baraka campaign. I make just one caveat: keep me as far away
&gt;from the dogmatists as possible.

JFort, what has POP as an organization done to elect ras baraka? until 
something, the new brunswick peoples campaign maintains the right to be 
"very disappointed with the lack of POP's involvement in newark's may 14 
election".

what do the greens plan to DO to get ras baraka elected? 16 days left...

Subject:ALL DOUGLASS WOMEN: VOTE KELLY BRENNAN TODAY!<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Our last election for DCGA ended in a TIE for the position of Internal Vice
President! This illustrates ever more strongly that it is *vital* that
people turn out today to vote Kelly Brennan for Internal Vice President!
Polls are open at the Douglass College Center between 10 AM and 4 PM. Stop
by and cast your vote; one vote does make a difference!

Kelly Brennan is the DOUGLASS UNITED candidate for Internal Vice President.
She is committed to the Douglass United platform--fighting the budget cuts,
smashing all forms of oppression, valuing the traditions of Douglass
College, standing up for women's services, and struggling for student
democracy. As Class of 2005 president, she has worked in her class and in
DCGA to rectify women's body image issues on campus, and has refounded
CURVES (Combatting Un-Realistic Views of Eating and Size); she has, as a
member of the Presidential Search Action Committee, been actively involved
in standing for a strong student representation in the upcoming search for a
Rutgers University president. In addition, Kelly has taken a leading role in
fighting privatization at the University and in building a student-labor
alliance with maintenance and custodial workers. She has consistently
represented the interests of students with dedication and passion, and she
will bring this commitment to the position of Internal Vice President.

Vote Kelly Brennan!
Douglass United

Subject:RALLY AGAINST THE BUDGET CUTS! FOR AFFORDABLE EDUCATION!<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Tomorrow, at 2:30 PM, on the steps of Brower Commons, the associated
Student Governing Associations of Rutgers--DCGA, LCGA, RCGA and CCC--will
sponsor a rally for affordable education and against the budget cuts. As
students at a public state university, we recognize the importance of the
mission of the public university--affordable, accessible, high-quality
education available to all. The university exists--or should exist--as a
resource for the people of the state, and must be valued as such. Instead,

University Professor Jose Solis Jordan, jailed by Federal authorities since 
1999 for allegedly being a terrorist, will be transfered to the Federal 
Prison in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, by the end of April, according to 
information received from his wife Marta Gonzalez.  It is expected that on 
July 23, 2002, he will be released to a halfway house in Trujillo Alto, and 
that we will complete his sentence in November at which time he will be 
released to the community at large.

Solis Jordan, who taught at the Education Department of the Rio Piedras 
campus of the University of Puerto Rico, was found guilty by a federal jury 
on March 12, 1999, for allegedly placing a bomb outside an army recruitment 
center in Chicago in December of 1992. No one was killed or wounded in that 
blast.  At that time, Solis Jordan was working as a professor at the 
University of DePaul and was doing volunteer work at the Corretjer Puerto 
Rican Cultural Center, both also in Chicago.

Rafael Marrero, infiltrator and provacteur

The star witness of federal proesecutors was the undercover infiltrator and 
agent provacateur Rafale Marrero, who admitted during the trial to having 
placed the bomb in question and to having recieved immunity in addition to 
$119,000 dollars for his services for the F.B.I. Besides Marrero's testimony 
and the allegations of the F.B.I., prosecutors did not present any other 
evidence to substantiate their case.  It was the word of honor of the F.B.I. 
and that of one of its informants against the word of a Puerto Rican 
independentista accused of bombing a federal building.  The jury, that did 
not have even one Latino in it, and whose Chairwomen was an employee of the 
Justice Department, believed federal prosecutors.

Marrero was not an unknown to the independence movement or to the Puerto 
Rican community in Chicago. This individual made his "entrance" on the 
political scence in Puerto Rico during the 1980's, when he became a member 
of the Anti-Electoral Front where he worked to create divisions and internal 
conflicts.

A the end of the 1980's, Marrero, moved to Chicago, where he became active 
in the Puerto Rican community and gained the trust of the staff at the 
Corretjer Cultural Center. He agressively sought to become friends with the 
family and friends of the Puerto Rican political prisoners.  He then married 
Evelyn odriguez, sister of then political prisoners Ida Luz and Alicia 
Rodriguez.  He had a child with Evelyn Rodriguez who he named Alicia Luz in 
honor of the baby's two aunts.

At the Cultural Center, Marrero began to plant and promote discord amogn the 
staff,assumed ultra-leftist and hardline positions, as he tried to instigate 
his comrades to commit acts of violence. Marrero also begin a campaign to 
discredit Jose Lopez, Director of that institution.

It was at this time that Jose Solis Jordan and Marrero met, given that their 
wives were close friends.  In 1995 Solis Jordan and his family returned to 
Puerto Rico. In the meantime, Marrero "transformed" himself from an ultra 
sectarian revolutionary to a attack dog and enemy of anything that was done 
and said by the independence movement.

At that time, Marrero began to publish and distribute El Pito, a defamatory 
newsletter dedicated to slander the Puerto Rican community and its leaders, 
especially targetting Jose Lopez and U.S. Congressman Luis Gutierrez 
(D-Chicago).  The financial backers and supporters of El Pito, were the 
developers and real estate interests that sought to sell block by block the 
Puerto Rican community in Chicago to right whites.  Among these developers 
and realtors was Gloria Chevere, who has close ties to Carlos Romero 
Barcelo.

Political Intrigue

According to Jose Lopez and his collegues at the Cultural Center, Chevere 
and Romero Barcelo have channeled funds which in part have come from the 
financial backers of the PNP prostatehood party in Puerto rico, in order to 
finance the election campaigns of Congressman Gutierrez' opponents. Romero 
detests Gutierrez not only because he (Gutierrez) is an Independentista but 
alos because of his friendly ties to the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto 
Rico and because Gutierrez torpedoed the Young Bill in 1998.

In addition to using the El Pito newsletter as a anti-Puerto Rican platform, 
Marrero served as a source for a series of sensationalist articles that 
appeared in February of 1997 in the Chicago daily newspaper the Sun Times.  
In these articles it was alleged that in the Roberto Clemente School,in the 
Puerto Rican Community and affiliated to the Corretjer Cultural Center, 
students were indoctrinated with pro-independentista ideas and that some of 
its teachers were members of the FALN (Amed Forces for National 
Liberation,in English).

These "reports" motivated the State Legislature of Illinois to launch an 
investigation of the Roberto Clemente School, which was led by right-wing 
Representative Edgar Lopez, a declared enemy of the independence movement 
and of Luis Gutierrez.

The star witness of this investigation was none other than Marrero, who 
testified before legislators that the Clemente School was a hideout and den 
of terrorists and that the school was chanelling and using State and Federal 
funds to finance pro-independence propaganda and to support the campaign to 
free the Puerto Rican political prisoners.
But the investigation which was described by the Puerto Rican Community as a 
McCarthyist witch hunt, did not find evidence of even one illegal action at 
the Clemente School or the Puerto Rican Cultural Center

Imprisoned, but not defeated

Of the time that Solis Jordan was in jail the first few months were the 
worst because it was during this time that he was subjected to countless 
humiliations and indignities.  He was held for various weeks at the state 
peneteniary in Peoria, forced to sleep on the floor of a cell that was 
infested with rodens and was later transferred to the Federal Peniteniary in 
Coleman, Florida, where he is imprisoned today.  His first three weeks at 
Coleman were spent in solitary confinement and in chains 23 hours a day.

Once he was in general population at Coleman, he did not resort to cursing 
his bad luck, nor did he resign himself to the stuation, he kept busy by 
developing new projects and helping his fellow inmates.  Solis Jordan is 
presently giving G.E.D. Classes to other prisoners.  At first, the prison 
authorities assign to him about a dozen "troublemakers" or "incorregibles" 
to see what would happen.  After a few weeks, his classes were filled to 
capacity as more and more inmates wanted to participate in his classes.

In addition to lending a helping hand to any prisoner that requested it, 
often for things such as how to write a letter or to know their rights, he 
also is writing a book about investigative methodologies.

Solis is the father of 5 children.  Three of them are children of a previous 
marriage of his wifes, whose first husband died in a tragic accident.

&gt;education available to all. The university exists--or should exist--as a
&gt;resource for the people of the state, and must be valued as such. Instead,
&gt;however, it has come under attack--budgets repeatedly slashed and calls

Eight Inmates Die in Cells as Fire Races Through Jail

May 5, 2002 

By DAVID M. HALBFINGER


 

BAKERSVILLE, N.C., May 4 - Eight inmates were killed when a
cramped, outmoded jail here erupted in flames on Friday
night, billowing smoke so thick that rescuers were unable
even to unlock the prisoners' cells, the authorities said. 

The fire at the Mitchell County jail, here in the western
North Carolina hills not far from the Tennessee border,
also injured 13 people, including two sheriff's deputies
who crawled through the suffocating smoke, unlocked one
cell, and led eight inmates outside to safety. 

Sheriff Kenneth R. Fox said that state fire investigators
arrived today and had indicated that they believed the
fire, which burned for close to 90 minutes, had started
accidentally. He said it appeared to have started in a
brick and wood storage shed next to a small first-floor
holding cell used as a drunk tank. The shed held cleaning
equipment, wiring and a small electric heater, but the
sheriff said he did not believe the heater was in use at
the time. 

One inmate in that cell, Joey Grindstaff, 23, was killed,
Sheriff Fox said. The other seven men who died were trapped
in an upstairs cell. Mr. Grindstaff had been arrested on
Thursday or Friday after leading officers on a chase, the
sheriff said. 

Sheriff Fox said that although at least one of the dead,
who were aged 20 to 46, was awaiting trial on felony
charges, most were in on minor charges, and he described
several as "good boys." He said he was unable to provide
the exact charges most of the dead had been facing, their
addresses or survivors. 

One victim, Mark Thomas, 20, was serving a minor sentence -
the sheriff said he believed it was for driving while
intoxicated or a lesser offense - on weekends only, and was
to receive his high-school equivalency diploma next
weekend, Sheriff Fox said. 

The sheriff said he had attended high school with Mr.
Thomas's father, but that he had not yet spoken to any of
the victims' families. 

"You don't know what to say to them," he said. 

Residents
of this town of 500, which is an hour's drive north of
Asheville and home to miners, furniture makers and farmers,
said they could not remember anything so devastating. Even
the 1998 flood of the Cane Creek, which resulted in major
property damage, did not kill anyone, they said. 

"It just breaks your heart," said Kim Hoyle, 34, a former
jailer herself who said she knew most of the victims by
sight or better. "I just get cold chills when I think about
it. I just hope they all knew the Lord before they died." 

The two-story brick jail, connected to a 95-year-old
courthouse by a second-story walkway, was built in 1955
and, like many aging jails in this part of the state,
needed to be replaced, the sheriff said. Officials said it
had been cited for overcrowding as recently as 1997 when it
was used to hold up to 24 inmates, but it was housing 17
inmates on Friday. 

Inmates were allowed to smoke in their cells, but were not
included in regular fire drills, the sheriff said. "You
open a door on some and they'll be gone," he said. 

The jail had no sprinkler system. Cell windows were open to
let fresh air in, but acted like a chimney when the fire
broke out, the sheriff said. 

Though lights-out was not until midnight or 1 a.m., and an
intercom allowing the jailer to communicate with the
inmates was functioning, the jailer on duty did not hear
any shouts or commotion, the sheriff said. 

According to the sheriff's account, the jailer, Diane
Greene, was in an office with the lone female inmate,
Melissa Robinson, 30, who was also a trusty. The two
smelled smoke and Ms. Greene called 911 at 10:05 p.m. The
first firefighters and Deputy Chuck Vines Jr. arrived three
minutes later. 

Deputy Vines, 25, who is the son of Bakersville's mayor,
struggled to retain his composure as he described seeing
the rear of the jail in flames. He said he and a colleague,
Deputy Stacy Hughes, along with one of the first
firefighters on the scene, Mike Smith, all made their way
through the smoke to the first-floor cell. Deputy Hughes
had to race outside for fresh air, while Deputy Vines and
Mr. Smith escorted four conscious inmates outside. Four
others had to be carried out, he said. 

The smoke was so thick that rescuers could not climb the
jail's own stairs to the second floor, Deputy Vines said,
so he and Deputy Hughes tried to lead firefighters through
the courthouse to the jail's upper floor, where seven
inmates were trapped in a group cell. 

But the smoke and heat stopped them, he said. "Stacy and I
and the other firemen without their breathing apparatus
were having to find fresh air, quick," he said. All seven
inmates died. 

Besides Mr. Thomas and Mr. Grindstaff, the dead were:
Edmond Banks, 46; Danny Johnson, 42; Jesse Davis, 27;
Jeremiah Presnell, 20; Jason Boston, 27; and Tywain Neal,
28. 

Two of the surviving inmates were still in the hospital
this afternoon, two had been transferred to another jail,
and five had been released on bond. The jail will be closed
indefinitely. 

Rodney Burleson, 24, said he knew most of the inmates who
died. "Everybody went to the same high school, so everybody
knows who everybody is," he said. 

Mr. Burleson knew Mr. Boston, whose survivors included
three children, one an infant. He said Mr. Boston had been
given the choice between community service and three days
in jail, "and he took the days in jail." 

Joan Conley, the grandmother of Mr. Presnell, said he had
served two weeks of a 60-day sentence for repeatedly
driving without a license. "He never did get a license,
bless his heart," she said. 

Mrs. Conley said Mr. Presnell left behind two daughters,
ages 2 and 3. 

"He'd called me last week and talked to me on the phone,"
she said. "He said, `Mamaw, I just want to know if you're
all right.' I said, `I'm not doing too well.' But I said,
`I want you to get your life straightened out and live for
the Lord.' He said, `Don't you worry, soon as I get out of
here I'm going to be a different person.' 

"And he told me he loved me about three
times."

RUTGERS UNIVERSITY:

A plan to keep the names of prospective Rutgers University presidents under 
wraps would violate the state's newly amended public-information laws, an 
expert on the statute said.

Those who are leading the search for a new Rutgers president said they plan 
to maintain confidentiality throughout the process of finding a successor 
for Francis L. Lawrence.

In launching the search last month, Board of Governors Chairman Gene O'Hara 
said the process should remain confidential, in order to attract highly 
qualified applicants.

Disclosure could cause candidates to lose interest, O'Hara said, since 
publicity has caused applicants for some top posts at universities to lose 
their jobs.

Search committee chairman John Colaizzi - dean of Rutgers' Ernest Mario 
School of Pharmacy - agreed.

"The caliber of candidates we try to attract would really dictate that the 
confidentiality be maintained throughout the entire process," Colaizzi said.

Many Rutgers professors contend the process should be less secretive, at 
least once the finalists are picked.

"I think it would be highly desirable for members of the university 
community other than the search committee to interact with those 
candidates," said chemistry Professor Martha Cotter, who chairs the 
Rutgers-New Brunswick Faculty Council.

The council has urged Colaizzi and the board to let professors and students 
meet the finalists and provide input before the appointment is made.

Without such input, English Professor William Dowling said, "the search 
committee is asking the university to buy a pig in a poke."

Lawrence's critics claim the search that led to his appointment in 1990 was 
flawed, in part because most professors and students didn't meet him until 
he was hired, and they never met his competition.

At the time, Rutgers was not legally obliged to identify the finalists, 
since state law only required disclosure of documents that universities and 
public agencies were statutorily required to keep.

But amendments to the public-records law that take effect July 8 will force 
Rutgers to release the resumes of applicants for university posts, according 
to Arlene M. Turinchak, an associate in the Somerset law firm, McGimpsey &amp; 
Cafferty, which re-wrote the law.

The revised law defines most documents maintained by state agencies and 
universities as public records, Turinchak said.

Exceptions include students' admission records, test questions and certain 
materials related to academic research.

"There's nothing in here that would exempt resumes," she said.

Colaizzi, while conceding that he could not address the fine points of the 
law, disagreed.

"The university's position is that this policy of confidentiality in this 
particular search is consistent with the applicable state laws in New 
Jersey," he said.

Kim Manning-Lewis, acting executive director of university relations, said 
Rutgers' stance will serve the best interests of the institution and the 
state.

Rutgers is hardly alone in seeking to shield presidential applicants from 
publicity, said Marlene Ross, senior author of a report on university 
presidents issued in 2000 by the American Council of Education.

About 30 percent of public universities decline to identify candidates, Ross 
said.

"One of the reasons for not making the names public is that it undermines 
(the candidate's) credibility in their own institution," she said. 
"Obviously, only one person will get the presidency."

In Florida, where public universities must disclose the names of all 
presidential aspirants, she said, officials complain that they get a small 
pool of applicants.

Public universities in several states have faced lawsuits for withholding 
information on presidential candidates, according to an article that 
appeared in the Winter 2000 edition of the Journal of College and University 
Law.

As a result, the article said, legislators in Michigan, New Mexico and Texas 
enacted laws that protect public universities from disclosing the full list 
of applicants for presidential posts.

But in all three states, the laws require institutions to identify the 
finalists within a specified number of days before an appointment becomes 
final.

Colaizzi said publishing the names of finalists - some of whom would not get 
the job - would hamper Rutgers' search.

"That would really put them in an embarrassing situation in their home 
institution and would detract from their ability to lead at their home 
institution," he said. "My sense is that this would hurt us."

At least some presidential candidates who have been passed over for 
prestigious posts have recovered quite well.

Less than a year after being eliminated from contention for the top job at 
Harvard University, former University of Michigan President Lee Bollinger 
was hired in October to lead Columbia University.

According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, Bollinger walked away from 
an annual salary offer at Michigan of $700,000, which was slated to double 
the following year.

Subject:Re: is this nj greens support?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
my first words of this correspondence are clearly
on behalf of the new brunswick peoples campaign... (see 
poprogress@egroups.com - pop proposal)

ray higbee (njcampus greens coordinato) does not know who ras baraka is 
because the njgreens are being heavily influenced by 
counter-revolutionaries. what else have they proven beyond that? yet 
matthew, as an extension of U&amp;S, will defend njgreens. why? can U&amp;S edit 
board explain?

why is unity&amp;struggle not in distribution this entire ras campaign? trend?
how is it matthew has time to attempt to mediate a dialog but no time to 
produce/distribute unity&amp;struggle?
who is to answer for this?

matthew/U&amp;S,
fortunato has a tone of support for baraka, does that mean his practical 
line is in support of baraka?
or must we seperate the 2 to distinguish between them in order to see one's 
true objectives.

the new brunswick peoples campaign not only maintains our criticism with pop 
&amp; njgreens/fabw for their lack of involvement with getting baraka elected - 
nbpc feels betrayed by unity&amp;struggle in our very real &amp; practical efforts 
to advance political line struggle and in turn advance our political line.

&gt;
&gt;Truth is, neither Joe F. or Joe S. speak for Ras Baraka's campaign, &amp; as it

&gt;Mr. Joe Smith:
&gt;
&gt;I share Ray Higbee's sentiments about YOU, which was the point of his 
&gt;email.
&gt;You have done nothing but DAMAGE to the relationship between Ras Baraka and
&gt;progressive organizations. People are correct to question who you work for
&gt;at
&gt;this point.
&gt;
&gt;In one of your emails, you took credit for getting POP and the Greens to
&gt;move
&gt;for Ras.Nothing could be further from the truth. You have created a
&gt;RELUCTANCE among people to get involved because many people mistakenly
&gt;believe you speak for the campaign.
&gt;
&gt;I was at Baraka campaign headquarters yesterday and met some great people
&gt;who
&gt;are actually building this campaign constructively. You were not among 
&gt;them.
&gt;Now, progressives who want to get others to support the campaign first have
&gt;to explain that Joe Smith does not represent the politics or charater of 
&gt;the
&gt;Baraka campaign.  So, I share Ray's sentiment. I will also share his
&gt;analysis
&gt;that this IS NOT the only way or even, in your words "...the biggest move
&gt;for
&gt;revolutionary democracy that we in America can make."
&gt;
&gt;I will say what Ray said in differrent terms...go do your splitting and
&gt;wrecking some place else.  Whether or not you are part of a cointelpro
&gt;operation, you are objectively playing that role. You need not answer this:
&gt;I'm done responding to you. Only a fool continues to argue with a crazy

this is my response to this message from the head of njgreens, joe 
fortunato.

&gt;Mr. Joe Smith:
&gt;I share Ray Higbee's sentiments about YOU, which was the point of his 
&gt;email.
&gt;You have done nothing but DAMAGE to the relationship between Ras Baraka and
&gt;progressive organizations. People are correct to question who you work for 
&gt;at
&gt;this point.

i have done nothing to damage the relationship between baraka &amp; 
"progressive" organizations.
especially when the relationship doesn't exist to begin with. neither POP or 
njgreens are working with the committee to elect baraka. your tone aside, 
you have contributed nothing.

i work for the home depot. i encourage people to question me. i embrace 
questions &amp; inquiry.
it is one of my many motivators. &amp; in turn it allows me to question &amp; 
inquire about people &amp; organizations like you fortunato &amp; your organization.

&gt;In one of your emails, you took credit for getting POP and the Greens to 
&gt;move
&gt;for Ras.Nothing could be further from the truth. You have created a
&gt;RELUCTANCE among people to get involved because many people mistakenly
&gt;believe you speak for the campaign.

i said it was good that pop met w/ras &amp; that you pledged "all support" from 
njgreens &amp; that debby got her lawn sign. all of which happened after my 
initial criticism. even though "all support" is an entire lie - or is there 
a better reason of why all support means that no njgreens even know who 
baraka is?

&gt;I was at Baraka campaign headquarters yesterday and met some great people 
&gt;who
&gt;are actually building this campaign constructively. You were not among 
&gt;them.
&gt;Now, progressives who want to get others to support the campaign first have
&gt;to explain that Joe Smith does not represent the politics or charater of 
&gt;the
&gt;Baraka campaign.

what did you contribute, in your all important to mention, stop at baraka 
headquarters. what has njgreens actually contributed to the committee to 
elect ras baraka during this entire campaign?

i am among those people, just ask them 973.242.0522. ask them exactly who i 
am &amp; what i've contributed.
i encourage you to do so.

&gt;So, I share Ray's sentiment. I will also share his analysis
&gt;that this IS NOT the only way or even, in your words "...the biggest move 
&gt;for
&gt;revolutionary democracy that we in America can make."

what you should be sharing with Ray is directions to baraka headquarters &amp; a 
time you will meet him to help do some work in newark in support of the 
committee to elect.

what is your analysis of the biggest move for revolutionary democracy? show 
it to me.

&gt;I will say what Ray said in differrent terms...go do your splitting and
&gt;wrecking some place else.  Whether or not you are part of a cointelpro
&gt;operation, you are objectively playing that role. You need not answer this:
&gt;I'm done responding to you. Only a fool continues to argue with a crazy 
&gt;man.
&gt;And don't go away mad, just go away.

what am i splitting &amp; wrecking? again, &amp; slower this time... there is no 
relationship between pop, njgreens, fabw &amp; the committee to elect ras 
baraka. my criticism is the result of an already living split. how can my 
comment on the fact that pop is doing nothing as an organization to elect 
ras baraka, be the cause of a split. my criticism wouldn't exist if pop was 
working with the committee to elect.

pop, njgreens, &amp; fabw have done nothing to get baraka elected.  no voter 
registration. no marches or rallies. no fundraisers, dinners, or events. no 
phone bank or literature. &amp; what's worst no coalition building, NO UNITED 
FRONT WORK!!
the njdemocrats have done more than nothing.

for fortunato to even bring cointelpro into this discussion demonstrates how 
desperate njgreens are.
when one's political arguement is defeated, reactionary approaches seize the 
day.

by fortunato telling me to go away must have one question who is creating 
splits. -jsmith

<pre>mr patterson,
why do these properties maintain a different relationship to the 
condemnation process? the other buildings have been cleared &amp; new buildings 
have already been raised on the properties that are not owned by the mayor's 
cousin, reng.

maybe you can explain this condemnation process more clearly so i can be 
more accurate.

P.S. - **nbpc position**
cahill should be oblidged to repay all monies exploited to those rutgers 
students.
any ethical civil servant would not reimburse only the 13 months that the 
law demands.
mayor cahill must repay EVERY PENNY, or else what does that say about our 
city officials?
cahill should also pledge support from city hall to the Community 
Empowerment Project in order to help protect other tenants who are unaware 
of such loopholes that operate to exploit ru students &amp; starve nb children.

&gt;Mr. Smith,

&gt;For an Ethical City Government that will serve the people, not rule &amp;

&gt;this political machine obviously does not represent the interests of the

&gt;
&gt;this is no honest mistake, this practice is used by many city landlords.
&gt;just recently nb property owner paula samuelson lost court suits to 2 apt

&gt;
&gt;also, how is it that mayor cahill's cousin owns the only properties not

Enron Forced Up California Energy Prices, Documents Show

May 7, 2002 

By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and JEFF GERTH


 

WASHINGTON, May 6 - Electricity traders at Enron drove up
prices during the California power crisis through
questionable techniques that company lawyers said "may have
contributed" to severe power shortages, according to
internal Enron documents released today by federal
regulators. 

Within Enron, the documents show, traders used strategies
code-named Fat Boy, Ricochet, Get Shorty, Load Shift and
Death Star to increase Enron's profits from trading power
in the state - techniques that added to electricity costs
and congestion on transmission lines. 

The documents - memorandums written in December 2000 by
lawyers at Enron to another lawyer at the company - also
describe "dummied-up" power-delivery schedules, the
submission of "false information" to the state, and the
effective increasing of costs to all market participants by
"knowingly increasing the congestion costs." 

The memos, which provide the first inside look at the
complex trading strategies Enron used in California, give
strong ammunition to state officials who have long argued
that Enron and other power marketers manipulated the
state's market and played a crucial role in the crisis that
cost California consumers and utilities tens of billions of
dollars in 2000 and 2001. The documents state that other
power companies used similar techniques. 

Tonight, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California,
said she would ask Attorney General John Ashcroft "to
pursue a criminal investigation to determine whether in
fact federal fraud statutes or any other laws were
violated" by Enron's energy-trading activities. Federal
prosecutors are already conducting an inquiry into Enron's
accounting, which falsely increased reported profits but
ultimately led to the company's filing for bankruptcy
protection in December. 

Enron agreed to sell its energy-trading unit earlier this
year to UBS Warburg, a division of UBS, Switzerland's
largest bank. Nearly all of Enron's senior executives, and
most of its board members, have departed in the last nine
months. 

Enron's senior management learned of the documents in late
April, and the company's board decided during a meeting on
Sunday to waive attorney-client privilege and turn the
memos over to investigators at the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, a person close to the company said.
The company has also informed the Justice Department, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the attorney general
of California about the documents. 

At a noon meeting today, lawyers for Enron gave the memos
to investigators from the regulatory commission, which is
examining whether Enron manipulated energy markets in the
West. The agency released the documents a few hours later.
Officials at the commission declined to comment, but they
are continuing their investigation into Enron's effect on
power prices and asked the company today to provide
additional documents on its electricity and natural-gas
trading activities. 

In a letter sent by officials at the commission today to
Enron, investigators at the agency said the documents
described how Enron traders were "creating, and then
`relieving,' phantom congestion" on California's
electricity grid. The documents also detail what
investigators described as "megawatt laundering," in which
Enron bought power in California, resold the power out of
the state and then bought the power back and resold it back
into California - allowing Enron to circumvent price caps
meant to clamp down on costs. 

"These documents prove that these companies can manipulate
the market," said Loretta Lynch, the president of the
California Public Utilities Commission. "Enron prevented
California from seeing these documents for years, and now
we know why." 

Ms. Lynch said the documents supported her argument that
FERC should leave in place temporary electricity price
restraints, introduced last June, which state officials say
have played a large role in reining in prices. "I don't see
how FERC can remove the boundaries they put in place on our
market last June." 

An outside lawyer for Enron, Robert S. Bennett, said he
could not comment on the trading strategies described in
the documents. "Because we have sold the trading unit and
the people with the knowledge of trading practices are no
longer with the company, we do not know what the true facts
are, and we do not know which parts of the memoranda are
correct and which parts are incorrect," Mr. Bennett said
tonight. 

But he emphasized that the company had agreed to waive that
attorney-client privilege because it was trying to
cooperate with the various investigations into Enron's
business practices. "These memoranda came to the attention
of the board and current management in late April, and the
board instructed its counsel to not assert the
attorney-client privilege and produce these documents to
the appropriate government entities," Mr. Bennett said. 

Another memo written by a separate group of lawyers for
Enron in 2001 - apparently in January or February, after
soaring wholesale power prices in California pushed the
state's largest utilities to the brink of insolvency -
tried to play down the strategies described in the December
2000 memos. 

In this later memo, which was written to prepare Enron for
the "various investigations and litigation" it faced
because of the California power crisis, the lawyers
repeatedly tried to play down or cast doubt on the
conclusions drawn by Enron's own lawyers in the earlier
memos. 

"Some of the information" in the earlier memos "which
resulted in some erroneous assumptions and conclusions,
cannot be supported by the facts and evidence which are now
known," the later memo stated. 

In one strategy described in the December 2000 memos, Enron
would buy power from a state-run exchange for $250 a
megawatt-hour - the maximum under the price caps - and
resell it outside California for almost five times as much.


"Thus, traders could buy power at $250 and sell it for
$1,200," according to one memo. In that document, the Enron
lawyers acknowledged that such activity could be playing a
big role in causing electricity shortages in the state, but
they suggested that was not a significant concern. 

"This strategy appears not to present any problems," the
memo stated, "other than a public relations risk arising
from the fact that such exports may have contributed to
California's declaration of a Stage 2 Emergency yesterday."


The Death Star strategy, as described in the memos, allowed
Enron to be paid "for moving energy to relieve congestion
without actually moving any energy or relieving any
congestion." 

And the Load Shift strategy allowed Enron to generate about
$30 million in profits in 2000 using techniques that,
according to the documents, included creating "the
appearance of congestion through the deliberate
overstatement" of power to be delivered. 

In the past, Enron officials said the California power
crisis was caused by the state's deeply flawed electricity
deregulation plan, the lack of new power-generation
capacity and by temporary factors, like a drought that
drastically reduced available hydropower. Even some
economists who think price manipulation was widespread say
these other factors contributed to soaring prices. 

But Enron executives always insisted that absolutely
nothing their traders had done contributed to the crisis.
In an interview last year, Enron's former chairman, Kenneth
L. Lay, dismissed accusations that manipulation was even
partly to blame for California's troubles. 

"Every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price
spike, it's always collusion or conspiracy or something,"
Mr. Lay said in the interview, which was also taped for "
Frontline" on PBS. "I mean, it always makes people feel
better that way."

4 Arrested for Campaign Sign Removal

May 9, 2002
By THE NEW YORK TIMES 




 

NEWARK, May 8 - Four people, including a close aide to
Mayor Sharpe James, face criminal mischief charges for
removing campaign signs belonging to Mr. James's opponent
in Tuesday's election, the police said. 

The arrests were the latest episode in the bitter campaign
between Mr. James and Councilman Cory Booker, which has
been rife with allegations of dirty tricks. 

An unmarked police car was patrolling the city's North Ward
around 3 a.m. today when an officer saw four men removing
one of Mr. Booker's campaign signs from an oak tree near
312 Mount Prospect Avenue, the police said. 

The police arrested Danny Bass, 38; Laquan A. Dent, 29; and
William Miles, 37, all of Newark, and Malik Jones, 29, of
East Orange. Mr. Miles is a member of Mr. James's security
team. 

A van and a car belonging to the men were parked in the
street nearby. Inside the van, the police said, were other
Booker campaign signs that had been cut into pieces.

How Enron Got California to Buy Power It Didn't Need

May 8, 2002
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 




 

WASHINGTON, May 7 - Fat Boy. Death Star. Get Shorty. These
were the cocky nicknames that Enron traders gave the
complex trading strategies they employed in 2000 and 2001
to maximize gains in California's wholesale electricity
market. 

Enron is no longer in the trading business, and today its
interim chairman, Norman P. Blake Jr., condemned the
company's old tactics as "seemingly gaming the system" and
"very offensive," in testimony before a Senate panel. 

But documents released this week by federal regulators and
interviews with California officials indicate that when
Enron was flying high, its trading tactics exploited
weaknesses in the state's energy markets to the hilt. 

One set of strategies - which traders called Death Star and
Load Shift - involved creating the appearance of congestion
on California's power grid and then arranging for the state
to pay Enron to relieve the congestion. 

This could be done in a variety of ways, Enron lawyers
explained in internal memos. One method called for traders
to schedule power deliveries over lines already known to be
heavily congested. Meanwhile, they would keep loads light
in another part of the state. 

This tactic, the lawyers explained, would often result in
the state power-grid operator increasing the amount it was
willing to pay to electricity traders who were willing to
alter their deliveries to reduce congestion in the busier
region. And that is just what Enron did, collecting money
for "reverting back to its true load." 

Describing a related maneuver, the lawyers wrote, "Enron
gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without
actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion." 

The lawyers added that such congestion deals could be quite
profitable. "Because the congestion charges have been as
high as $750 per megawatt-hour, it can often be profitable
to sell power at a loss simply to be able to collect the
congestion payment," they wrote. By comparison, when
markets are functioning normally, electricity often costs
no more than $30 to $40 a megawatt-hour. 

The lawyers acknowledged that the money collected by Enron
came at the expense of utilities and consumers in
California. 

"By knowingly increasing the congestion costs, Enron is
effectively increasing the costs to all market
participants," they said, noting that one related tactic
generated $30 million in profit in 2000. 

A second set of strategies involved buying power in the
state at capped prices and then selling it for much more
elsewhere. 

With power costs soaring as the energy crisis developed
late in 2000, California imposed price caps that for much
of the time set the maximum price for power sold within the
state at $250 a megawatt-hour. 

But the price limit could easily be defeated by a crafty
trader, because it did not apply in surrounding states,
where power could be bought and sold at prices up to five
times the price cap. 

Federal regulators fixed this problem in June 2001, when
they imposed broad price restraints throughout the Western
United States. But for a time, as federal regulators
refused to take action, Enron traders reaped huge profits,
the memos from the Enron lawyers indicate. 

One approach was to simply take power bought in the state
and resell it in a nearby state. The documents describe
this as traders taking "advantage of arbitrage
opportunities." 

On Dec. 5, 2000, one Enron memo noted, "Traders could buy
power at $250 and sell it for $1,200." Doing so, it said,
"appears not to present any problems, other than a public
relations risk arising from the fact that such exports may
have contributed to California's declaration of a Stage 2
Emergency yesterday." 

In a Stage 2 alert, which is declared when grid managers
see that power reserves are declining below 5 percent of
the system's capacity, California officials ask that power
consumers voluntarily curtail their use of energy. 

Enron also engaged in what energy traders call "megawatt
laundering," a tactic labeled Ricochet in the Enron
documents. 

While the price caps prevented power from being sold in
California for more than $250, power brought in from out of
state could be sold for a higher price if the seller could
justify the costs - by explaining, for example, that it had
been acquired at a very high price. 

As described in the lawyers' memos, Enron bought
electricity in California and scheduled it "for export."
The electricity, they wrote, "is sent out of California to
another party, which charges a small fee per megawatt, and
then Enron buys it back to sell the energy" to the state's
grid operator. 

The third maneuver - the one called Get Shorty - involved a
strategy much like short selling shares of stock. Betting
that the price of a company's stock will fall, short
sellers borrow shares they do not own and then sell them in
the open market. If all goes well, they buy the shares back
later at the lower price and pocket the difference. 

Enron was essentially doing the same thing in the
California market, according to the internal documents and
state officials. Its traders shorted so-called ancillary
services - the term that is used to describe commitments by
energy companies to maintain idle power-generation capacity
for a set time, to be called on as needed. 

"The profit is made by shorting the ancillary services,
i.e., sell high and buy back at a lower price," the Enron
lawyers wrote. 

But there were risks to this strategy, the lawyers wrote,
as illustrated on one occasion when a trader failed to
cover a short position and the state's grid operator called
on Enron to fulfill its standby commitment to provide
power. 

The Enron lawyers also noted that the state grid operator's
rules required that sellers identify the specific source of
the power that would be provided, if the ancillary services
were called on. 

"As a consequence," the lawyers wrote, "in order to short
the ancillary services it is necessary to submit false
information that purports to identify the source of the
ancillary services." 

In the documents, the Enron lawyers said that many of the
same tactics were used by other energy companies doing
business in California. Both state officials and federal
energy regulators said today that they would question other
companies about whether that was true. 

Whether any or all of the tactics are legal will be the
focus of considerable debate. But today, the Washington
trade group that represents the nation's independent power
traders, the Electric Power Supply Association, distanced
itself from the activities that were described in the Enron
documents. 

"Practices designed to manipulate customer prices, create
unfair advantages for specific market participants or
threaten the reliability of the electricity grid cannot be
condoned," the group said.

First the New Brunswick Peoples Campaign demands voting rights for all NB 
residents who contribute to the city tax base. The New Brunswick City 
government can &amp; should establish an ordinance recognizing voting rights for 
all residents that contribute to the city tax base. There is nobody stopping 
residents from paying city property taxes because they are not �citizens", 
why stop them from voting on city officials? Who is threatened by Voting 
Rights for All?

Why do the properties owned by Mayor Cahill�s cousin, John Reng, maintain a 
different relationship to the condemnation process on George St &amp; Remsen 
Ave? The other buildings have been cleared &amp; new buildings have already been 
raised on the properties that are not owned by the mayor's cousin. Maybe 
NB�s planning developer, Glenn Patterson, can explain this condemnation 
process more clearly so the public can understand. Maybe Patterson can also 
address this question: why where the families &amp; other tenants immediately 
evicted by DEVCO from the apt./hotel at george&amp;livingston? The building 
wasn't leveled for over a year after. Is that what this city machine terms 
urban &amp; chic?

Cahill understands he must repay EVERY PENNY, but he should go the extra 
step &amp;  pledge support from city hall to the Community Empowerment Project 
in order to help protect other tenants who are unaware of such loopholes 
that operate to exploit ru students &amp; starve nb children.

For an Ethical City Government that will serve the people, not rule &amp; 
exploit, support the New Brunswick Peoples Campaign. The NB Democrat 
political machine proves time &amp; time again that it does not represent the 
interests of the people working &amp; living in the NB community.

This robbing of tenants in New Brunswick is no honest mistake, this practice 
is used by many crooked city landlords. Just recently NB property owner 
Paula Samuelson lost court suits to 2 apt tenants for thousands of dollars 
she extorted from them. Press releases went out for these cases, but 
unfortunately went unanswered.  The New Brunswick Peoples Campaign salutes 
the efforts of the young Community Empowerent Project.

The people of New Brunswick will have the opportunity to unite &amp; organize to 
do away with corrupt politicians like Cahill &amp; co. throughout this election 
campaign. The New Brunswick Peoples Campaign is organizing a Public 
Convention in which all attendents will have the opportunity to choose 
candidates to defeat the current Unethical City Machine - Tuesday 23May 
6:00pm NB Public Library.

What is our practice? Electoral politics requires a broad united front, 
which, with the correct leadership should also serve as mobilization and 
organization of peoples democracy.

Subject:Egan proposal to limit ballot questions on school reclassification<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>On March 18, 2002, Assemblyman Joe Egan -- also a New Brunswick city 
council member -- introduced A2112, with Assemblyman Joe Doria 
(District 31) also sponsoring, which would limit ballot questions on 
reclassification of school districts to once every five years. 

According to the statement released by Assemblymen Egan and 
Doria, "[t]his bill would prevent questions concerning the 
reclassification of school districts from appointed to elected school 
boards,  or vice versa, from annually recurring on the ballot. Under 
this bill, the question could be asked only once every five years, 
similar to the frequency that a question on a municipal charter study 
commission may appear on the ballot. Under current law a small group 
of voters may petition to have the reclassification question put on 
the ballot every year, which becomes a frivolous expense to the 
taxpayers."

The bill is still with the Assembly Education Committee, which is 
chaired by Assemblyman Doria. Go to 
http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2002/Bills/A2500/2112_I1.HTM to view a 
copy of the bill.

I suggest that interested parties send a press release condemning 
this effort to restrict such referenda.

&gt;May 16, 2002, 19:00 PDT (FTW) -- Never in the history of scandals
&gt;involving the United States government has an attempt to conceal
&gt;criminal conduct by an administration been more transparently
&gt;dishonest or more easily exposed. On May 15 White House Press
&gt;Secretary Ari Fleischer -- while making the startling admission that
&gt;President Bush received CIA and FBI intelligence briefings in August
&gt;indicating Osama bin Laden might be planning hijackings -- told major
&gt;news sources including CBS News, "All appropriate action was taken
&gt;based on the threat information we had," Fleischer said. "The
&gt;president did not -- not -- receive information about the use of
&gt;airplanes as missiles by suicide bombers."
&gt;
&gt;In other statements Fleischer told the press, "The president was also
&gt;provided information about bin Laden wanting to engage in hijacking
&gt;in the traditional pre-9-11 sense, not for the use of suicide
&gt;bombing, not for the use of an airplane as a missile." According to a
&gt;May 16 story by the New York Times, "Mr. Fleischer said the
&gt;information given to the president in Texas [last August], had
&gt;prompted the administration to put law enforcement agencies on
&gt;alert."
&gt;
&gt;Every major position taken by an administration in full retreat and
&gt;on the defensive can be easily deconstructed and shown to be false.
&gt;
&gt;For more than seven months FTW has been documenting specific warnings
&gt;received by the U.S. government from both foreign intelligence
&gt;services and, in one case, from Russian President Vladimir Putin,
&gt;indicating commercial airliners were going to be used by terrorists
&gt;to attack -- among other things -- the World Trade Center in the week
&gt;of Sept. 9. In order for Fleischer's statement to be credible he
&gt;would have to assert then that George W. Bush either ignored or was
&gt;not informed of a direct warning from a head of state and also from
&gt;the German intelligence service, the BND.
&gt;
&gt;As reported in the German daily Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung (FAZ)
&gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/f_a_zeitung_story.html on
&gt;Sept. 14, the BND warned both the CIA and Israel in June that Middle
&gt;Eastern terrorists were "planning to hijack commercial aircraft to
&gt;use as weapons to attack important symbols of American and Israeli
&gt;culture." The story specifically referred to an electronic
&gt;eavesdropping system known as Echelon, wherein a number of countries
&gt;tap cell phone and electronic communications in partner countries and
&gt;then pool the information. The BND warnings were also passed to the
&gt;United Kingdom.
&gt;
&gt;No known denial by the BND of the accuracy of this story exists, and
&gt;the FAZ report indicates the information was received directly from
&gt;BND sources.
&gt;
&gt;According to a Sept. 14 report in the Internet newswire online.ie,
&gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/online_ie_story.html German
&gt;police, monitoring the phone calls of a jailed Iranian man, learned
&gt;the man was telephoning U.S. intelligence agencies last summer to
&gt;warn of an imminent attack on the World Trade Center in the week of
&gt;Sept. 9. German officials confirmed the calls to the U.S. government
&gt;for the story but refused to discuss additional details.
&gt;
&gt;According to a story in Izvestia on Sept. 12, Russian intelligence
&gt;warned the U.S. last summer that as many as 25 suicide pilots were
&gt;training for suicide missions involving the crashing of airliners
&gt;into important targets.
&gt;
&gt;In an MSNBC interview on Sept. 15, Russian President Putin stated he
&gt;had ordered Russian intelligence to warn the U.S. government "in the
&gt;strongest possible terms" of imminent assaults on airports and
&gt;government buildings before the attacks on Sept. 11. No credible
&gt;information has emerged from any source indicating that Putin omitted
&gt;the above information when issuing the warning.
&gt;
&gt;Many other direct warnings were received by the U.S. government and
&gt;have been documented in FTW's 9-11 timeline located at:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/02_11_02_lucy.html.
&gt;
&gt;These stories give the immediate lie to Fleischer's statements that
&gt;Bush had no inkling of airliners being used as weapons.
&gt;
&gt;But there is more.
&gt;
&gt;In 1996 -- as reported by the German paper Die Welt on Dec. 6, and by
&gt;Agence France Presse on Dec. 7 -- Western intelligence services,
&gt;including the CIA, learned after arrests in the Philippines that Al
&gt;Qaeda operatives had planned to crash commercial airliners into the
&gt;Twin Towers. Details of the plan, as reported by a number of American
&gt;press outlets, were found on a computer seized during the arrests.
&gt;The plan was called "Operation Bojinka." Details of the plot were
&gt;disclosed publicly in 1997 in the New York trial of Ramsi Youssef for
&gt;his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
&gt;
&gt;FBI MEMOS TRIGGER WHITE HOUSE BACKSTEPPING
&gt;
&gt;In "traditional" hijackings the hijackers have no need or desire to
&gt;learn how to fly.
&gt;
&gt;As reported by the New York Times, CNN and the Washington Post (among
&gt;others) the events leading to Fleischer's statements were the recent
&gt;disclosure of FBI memoranda originated by field agents in Arizona and
&gt;Minnesota that warned of a possible hijack attempt by bin Laden's
&gt;followers. In both cases the suspects were taking flight lessons.
&gt;
&gt;According to Newsweek and the New York Times, FBI agents in Phoenix
&gt;submitted a classified memorandum in July naming Osama bin Laden and
&gt;tracking the activities of possible Middle Eastern terrorist suspects
&gt;who had enrolled in local flight schools. The memo, according to the
&gt;Times, stated bin Laden's followers "could use the schools to train
&gt;for terror operations." The information in the Phoenix memo was not
&gt;shared with FBI field agents in Minnesota who had uncovered other
&gt;startling evidence.
&gt;
&gt;Just days before the attacks in early-September, FBI agents in
&gt;Minnesota wrote notes that subsequently became included in an
&gt;internal FBI document warning that accused terrorist Zacarias
&gt;Moussaoui "might be planning on flying something into the World Trade
&gt;Center." A story from the May 20 issue of Newsweek by Michael Isikoff
&gt;described how a local flight instructor had reported Moussaoui
&gt;had "showed a suspicious interest in learning how to steer [and not
&gt;land] large airliners�The [FBI] agents were `in a frenzy, absolutely
&gt;convinced he was planning to so something with a plane.'"
&gt;
&gt;A multitude of sources have reported the FBI agents requested a
&gt;warrant to search Moussaoui's personal computer but were denied by
&gt;Attorney General John Ashcroft's Justice Department. After the 9-11
&gt;attacks the computer was seized and found to contain information
&gt;directly related to the World Trade Center attacks.
&gt;
&gt;This apparent lack of support from within the administration is
&gt;consistent with reports released last fall by the BBC's Gregg Palast
&gt;showing that in January 2001 the Bush Administration had issued
&gt;direct orders to the FBI to curtail investigations of two of Osama
&gt;bin Laden's relatives, Omar and Abdullah bin Laden. The two bin
&gt;Ladens had been connected to possible terrorist activities and were
&gt;living in Falls Church, Va., near CIA headquarters.
&gt;
&gt;APPROPRIATE WARNINGS?
&gt;
&gt;Fleischer's statement that adequate warnings had been given to
&gt;appropriate federal agencies falls flat on its face. Two of the
&gt;most "appropriate" agencies would have been the Federal Aviation
&gt;Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard.
&gt;
&gt;As documented by researchers like Jared Israel at www.tenc.net, it
&gt;has been standard FAA procedure for more than 25 years to scramble
&gt;U.S. fighters to intercept -- not shoot down -- any errant or non-
&gt;responsive aircraft under FAA control. This protocol is even more
&gt;stringent in the case of a hijacking. Yet, Vice President Dick Cheney
&gt;and others have stated publicly there were no fighters available in
&gt;some cases, and there was no heightened state of alert on Sept. 11.
&gt;For 50 minutes on 9-11, in direct contravention of established
&gt;policy, no fighters were scrambled to intercept two outstanding
&gt;hijacked airliners even though it was known attacks were in progress.
&gt;
&gt;Given the above information, it would have been an obvious move to
&gt;have placed fighter aircraft on a heightened state of alert in this
&gt;time period. This unresponsiveness stands in contrast to the fact
&gt;that, in October 1999 at a time when there was no heightened alert,
&gt;the ill-fated Lear Jet occupied by golfer Payne Stewart had an F-16
&gt;fighter and an A-10 attack aircraft flying beside it within minutes
&gt;of losing radio contact and veering off course.
&gt;
&gt;INSIDER TRADING
&gt;
&gt;FTW has spent months on this important story that proves
&gt;foreknowledge of the attacks by people who also profited from them.
&gt;This was a glaring warning signal, since such trades ran the risk of
&gt;being detected by intelligence agencies that routinely monitor all
&gt;market activity in real time.
&gt;
&gt;The insider trading involves the placement of large numbers of "put"
&gt;options on stocks of companies directly affected by the Sept. 11
&gt;attacks. They include United Air Lines, American Air Lines, Morgan
&gt;Stanley, Merrill Lynch, AXA Reinsurance, Munich Reinsurance and Swiss
&gt;Reinsurance. Put options are a leveraged bet that a stock's price
&gt;will fall dramatically.
&gt;
&gt;As CBS news noted on Sept. 26, the peak of trading activity occurred
&gt;just before the attacks. There was a jump in United Air Lines put
&gt;options 90 times (not 90 percent) above normal between Sept. 6 and
&gt;Sept.10, and 285 times higher than average on Sept. 6. Numbers for
&gt;other affected stocks were equally alarming. It is uncontested that
&gt;only United and American stocks had this level of put buying before
&gt;the attacks. No other airlines were affected.
&gt;
&gt;A May 13 story by the Washington Times' Insight Magazine attempted to
&gt;explain the insider trading by stating higher numbers of put options
&gt;had been placed on United and American stocks earlier in 2001. By
&gt;relying only on the numbers of put options, Insight asserted that
&gt;there was nothing unusual about the pre-9-11 trades.
&gt;
&gt;However, FTW has contacted several experienced traders and reviewed
&gt;existing documentation from financial experts, which indicate the
&gt;alarm for insider trading is to look for any "imbalance" between the
&gt;level of put options (a bet that a stock's price will fall) and the
&gt;level of call options (a bet that a stock's price will rise). It is a
&gt;significant imbalance in puts vs. calls that indicates criminal
&gt;insider trading. The Insight piece did not address this point.
&gt;
&gt;Several traders have stated that in a fairly flat market with high
&gt;trading volumes, it has been a routine procedure for experienced
&gt;traders to place roughly equal numbers of puts and calls on various
&gt;stocks in order to generate a paper cash flow. They were quick to
&gt;point out that by September, the market had gone into sharp decline
&gt;and trading volumes were way down. Thus, lower numbers of put options
&gt;did not mean that everything was normal. They stressed it was the
&gt;imbalance in put-to-call ratios that signaled the insider trading.
&gt;[Ed. Note: FTW has undertaken a more detailed investigation of this
&gt;trading activity and hopes to have a more comprehensive report within
&gt;4-6 weeks].
&gt;
&gt;Part of the problem in Insight's research stems from the fact that
&gt;since Sept. 11, there has been no transparency from either the
&gt;government or the financial sector on how the trades worked or how
&gt;the markets tracked them. Secrecy is everywhere. Telephone calls have
&gt;not been returned, and the government refuses to divulge any
&gt;information about probes it admits are still ongoing. But simplistic
&gt;dismissals from sources quoted in the Insight story contradict not
&gt;only other evidence, but statements made by financial experts and
&gt;major news sources just after the attacks.
&gt;
&gt;"This could very well be insider trading at the worst, most horrific,
&gt;most evil use you've ever seen in your entire life�This would be one
&gt;of the most extraordinary coincidences in the history of mankind if
&gt;it was a coincidence," said Dylan Ratigan of Bloomberg Business News,
&gt;interviewed Sept. 20 on Good Morning Texas.
&gt;
&gt;"'I saw put-call numbers higher than I've ever seen in 10 years of
&gt;following the markets, particularly the options markets,' said John
&gt;Kinnucan, principal of Broadband Research, as quoted in the San
&gt;Francisco Chronicle," reported the Montreal Gazette on Sept. 19.
&gt;
&gt;To quote 60 Minutes from Sept. 19, "Sources tell CBS News that the
&gt;afternoon before the attack, alarm bells were sounding over unusual
&gt;trading in the U.S. stock options market."
&gt;
&gt;Assertions that the reported number of puts involved were not
&gt;abnormal also failed to analyze highly intricate shell games that
&gt;involve the movement of put options to markets outside the U.S. or
&gt;hidden in what traders refer to as "net positions." Serious financial
&gt;experts have indicated the profits from insider trading could have
&gt;been in the billions. Andreas von Bulow, a former member of the
&gt;German parliament responsible for oversight of Germany's intelligence
&gt;services, estimated the worldwide amount at $15 billion, according to
&gt;Tagesspiegel on Jan. 13. Other experts have estimated the amount at
&gt;$12 billion. CBS News gave a conservative estimate of $100 million.
&gt;
&gt;A hasty conclusion reached by many is the insider trades were placed
&gt;by bin Laden and his associates. Such a notion is flatly contradicted
&gt;by the now absolute certainty that such insider trades would have --
&gt;and apparently did -- set off alarm bells. It makes little sense to
&gt;argue bin Laden et al would have risked compromising at the last
&gt;minute an operation planned in total secrecy for at least four years.
&gt;
&gt;Also lacking credibility is the argument that many of the trades were
&gt;what some brokers described as inconsequential amounts valued at $1
&gt;million or $2 million. This does not address the possibility that
&gt;U.S. intelligence officials decided in a few cases to make a quick
&gt;profit from attacks they knew were going to succeed. As distasteful
&gt;as it may seem, this explanation is far more credible than an
&gt;assumption that bin Laden made the trades himself and risked the
&gt;exposure of what the world has been led to believe was his
&gt;life's "masterpiece."

&gt;
&gt;The explanations offered by the Bush Administration over the last 48
&gt;hours will not withstand even the slightest scrutiny if a major press
&gt;organization asks any question about the warnings received from
&gt;credible foreign government sources and heads of state. Other
&gt;questions must inevitably follow that will implode an oil
&gt;dictatorship whose sins and crimes are exposed and just waiting for
&gt;someone to pick them up and run with them.

"The Revolutionary Theatre"


LeRoi Jones
(from Liberator, July, 1965, pp. 4-6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------



This essay was originally commissioned by the New York Times in December 
1964, but was refused, with the statement that the editors could not 
understand it. The Village Voice also refused to run this essay. It was 
first published in Black Dialogue. --LeRoi Jones


The Revolutionary Theatre should force change, it should be change. (All 
their faces turned into the lights and you work on them black nigger magic, 
and cleanse them at having seen the ugliness and if the beautiful see 
themselves, they will love themselves.) We are preaching virtue again, but 
by that to mean NOW, what seems the most contructive uses of the world.

The Revolutionary Theatre must EXPOSE! Show up the insides of these humans, 
look into black skulls. Because they have been trained to hate. The 
Revolutionary Theatre must hate them for hating. For presuming with their 
technology to deny the supremacy of the Spirit. They will all die because of 
this.
The Revolutionary Theatre must teach them their deaths. It must crack their 
faces open to the mad cries of the poor. It must teach them about silence 
and the truths lodged there. It must kill any God anyone names except common 
Sense. The Revolutionary Theatre should flush the fags and murders out of 
Lincoln's face.
It should stagger through our universe correcting, insulting, preaching, 
spitting craziness . . . but a craziness taught to us in our most rational 
moments. People must be taught to trust true scientists (knowers, diggers, 
oddballs) and that the holiness of life is the constant possibility of 
widening the consciousness. And they must be incited to strike back against 
any agency that attempts to prevent this widening.

The Revolutionary Theatre must Accuse and Attack anything that can be 
accused and attacked. It must Accuse and Attack because it is a theatre of 
Victims. It looks at the sky with the victims' eyes, and moves the victims 
to look at the strength in their minds and their bodies.

Clay, in Dutchman, Ray, in The Toilet, Walker in The Slave are all victims. 
In the Western sense they could be heroes. But the Revolutionary Theatre, 
even if it is Western, must be anti-Western. It must show horrible coming 
attractions of The Crumbling of The West. Even as Artaud designed The 
Conquest of Mexico, so we must design The Conquest of White Eye, and show 
the missionaries and wiggly Liberals dying under blasts of concrete. For 
sound effects, wild screams of joy, from all the peoples of the world.

The Revolutionary Theatre must take dreams and give them a reality. It must 
isolate the ritual and historical cycles of reality. But it must be food for 
all these who need food, and daring propaganda for the beauty of the Human 
Mind. But it is a political theatre, a weapon to help in the slaughter of 
these dimwitted fat-bellied white guys who somehow believe that the rest of 
the world is here for them to slobber on.
This should be a theatre of World Spirit. Where the spirit can be shown to 
be the most competent force in the world. Force. Spirit. Feeling. The 
language will be anybody's, but tightened by the poet's backbone. And even 
the language must show what the facts are in this consciousness epic, what's 
happening. We will talk about the world, and the preciseness with which we 
are able to summon the world, will be our art. Art is method. And art, "like 
any ashtray or senator" remains in the world. Wittgenstein said ethics and 
aesthetics are one. I believe this. So the Broadway theatre is a theatre of 
reaction whose ethics like its aesthetics reflects the spiritual values of 
this unholy society, which sends young crackers all over the world blowing 
off colored peoples heads. (In some of these flippy southern towns they even 
shoot up the immigrants' Favorite Son, be it Michael Schwerner or J.F. 
Kennedy.)

The Revolutionary Theatre is shaped by the world, and moves to reshape the 
world, using as its force the natural force and perpetual vibrations of the 
mind in the world. We are history and desire, what we are, and what any 
experience can make us.

It is a social theatre, but all theatre is social theatre. But we will 
change the drawing rooms into places where real things can be said about a 
real world, or into smoky rooms where the destruction of Washington can be 
plotted. The Revolutionary Theatre must function like an incendiary pencil 
planted in Curtis Lemay's cap. So that when the final curtain goes down 
brains are splattered over the seats and the floor, and bleeding nuns must 
wire SOS's to Belgians with gold teeth.

Our theatre will show victims so that their brothers in the audience will be 
better able to understand that they are the brothers of victims, and that 
they themselves are victims, if they are blood brothers. And what we show 
must cause the blood to rush, so that pre-revolutionary temperaments will be 
bathed in this blood, and it will cause their deepest souls to move, and 
they find themselves tensed and clenched, even ready to die, at what the 
soul has been taught. We will scream and cry, murder, run through the 
streets in agony, if it means some soul will be moved, moved to actual life 
understanding of what the world is, and what it ought to be. We are 
preaching virtue and feeling, and a natural sense of the self in the world. 
All men live in the world, and the world ought to be a place for them to 
live.

What is called the imagination (from image, magi, magic, magician, etc.) is 
a practical vector from the soul. It stores all data, and can be called on 
to solve all our "problems." The imagination is the projection of ourselves 
past our sense of ourselves as "things." Imagination (image) is all 
possibility, because from the image, the initial circumscribed energy, and 
use (idea) is possible. And so begins that image's use in the world. 
Possibility is what moves us.

The popular white man's theatre like the popular white man's novel shows 
tired white lives, and the problems of eating white sugar, or else it herds 
bigcaboosed blondes onto huge stages in rhinestones and makes believe they 
are dancing or singing. WHITE BUSINESSMEN OF THE WORLD, DO YOU WANT TO SEE 
PEOPLE REALLY DANCING AND SINGING??? ALL OF YOU GO UP IN HARLEM AND GET 
YOURSELF KILLED. THERE WILL BE DANCING AND SINGING, THEN, FOR REAL! (In The 
Slave, Walker Vessels, the black revolutionary, wears an armband, which is 
the insignia of the attacking army . . . a big redlipped minstrel, grinning 
like crazy.)

The liberal white man's objection to the theatre of the revolution (if he is 
"hip" enough) will be on aesthetic grounds. Most white Western artists do 
not need to be "political," since usually, whether they know it or not, they 
are in complete sympathy with the most repressive social forces in the world 
today. There are more junior birdmen fascists running around the West today 
disguised as Artists than there are disguised as fascists. (But then, that 
word, Fascist, and with it, Fascism, has been made obsolete by the word 
America, and Americanism. The American Artist usually turns out to be just a 
super-Bourgeois, because, finally, all he has to show for his sojourn 
through the world is "better taste" than the Bourgeois . . . many times not 
even that.

Americans will hate the revolutionary theatre because it will be out to 
destroy them and whatever they believe is real. American cops will try to 
close the theatres where such nakedness of the human spirit is paraded. 
American producers will say the revolutionary plays are filth, usually 
because they will treat human life as if it was actually happening. American 
directors will say that the white guys in the plays are too abstract and 
cowardly ("don't get me wrong . . . I mean aesthetically . . .") and they 
will be right.
The force we want is of twenty million spooks storming America with furious 
cries and unstoppable weapons. We want actual explosions and actual 
brutality; AN EPOCH IS CRUMBLING and we must give it the space and hugeness 
of its actual demise. The Revolutionary Theatre, which is now peopled with 
victims, will soon begin to be peopled with new kinds of heroes . . . not 
the weak Hamlets debating whether or not they are ready to die for what's on 
their minds, but men and women (and minds) digging out from under a thousand 
years of "high art" and weakfaced dalliance. We must make an art that will 
function as to call down the actual wrath of world spirit. We are 
witchdoctors, and assassins, but we will open a place for the true 
scientists to expand our consciousness. This is a theatre of assault. The 
play that will split the heavens for us will be called THE DESTRUCTION OF 
AMERICA. The heroes will be Crazy Horse, Denmark Vessey, Patrice Lumumba, 
but not history, not memory, not sad sentimental groping for a warmth in our 
despair; these will be new men, new heroes, and their enemies most of you 
who are reading this.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

"The Revolutionary Theatre"



Two months before "The Revolutionary Theatre" was published, the month 
Malcolm X was murdered, Liberator magazine published a special issue devoted 
to X. In that issue, a description of a benefit performance at the St. Marks 
Theatre consisting of Jones' The Toilet and Experimental Death Unit #1, 
Charles Patterson's Black Ice, and Nat White's The Black Tramp. Accompanying 
the description was a fund-raising message from Jones in support of the 
"Black Arts Repertory Theatre School." The tone of this is, to put it 
mildly, rather different from "The Revolutionary Theatre," reflecting his 
concern to communicate to those "wiggly Liberals" he so eloquently 
threatened two months earlier. This request was published before BART/S had 
been formed; therefore, before HARYOU-ACT had supplied them with operating 
funds.
The Black Arts Repertory Theatre School, as its name indicates, will be a 
repertory theatre in Harlem, as well as a school. As a school it will set up 
and continue to provide instruction, both practical and theoretical, in all 
new areas of the dramatic arts.

Acting, writing, directing, set designing, production management workshops 
will open, aimed at gathering young negroes interesting in entering the 
professional theatre world. The Black Arts will in turn make use of these 
students in its own repertory company.

But the Black Arts will not only encourage interest by young negroes in the 
theatre, it will also provide already proven black dramatic talent with a 
showcase, as well as serving as a cultural center for all the performing 
arts.

We will be using the best black talent in this part of the world. We need 
help! First of all, we need money! Send contributions to:

Subject:Rent control<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The recent disclosures about landlord abuses in New Brunswick are a 
cry for swift, decisive, and punitive action against these lawless 
landlowners.  Regrettably, the city government is doing little to 
either prevent these violations from recurring, to restore money 
wrongfully stolen from tenants through landlords' deception, or to 
punish these landlords guilty of violating state and local laws on 
the subject.

One of the biggest lawbreakers identified to date has been Bishop 
Street Investors, LLC.  Its owners are the New Brunswick mayor, his 
brother, and his cousin.  Other lawbreakers include a city councilman 
(who is responsible for passing rent control and other ordinances) 
and a housing inspector (who is responsible for enforcing rent 
control ordinances).

These officials' excuse?  "I didn't know the law."  These claims 
cannot be taken seriously.  These people knew enough to register 
their properties with the rent control office (and pay the $10 fee 
for same), but then say they didn't know what the law said about 
maximum rent increases.  If you believe them, I have a bridge in 
Brooklyn I'd like to sell you!  

All of these officials are intimately involved with the rent control 
process, so for them to say 'I didn't know the law' is not credible.  
The mayor is an attorney and the chief law enforcement officer of the 
city.  The other officials -- a housing inspector and a councilman, 
likewise deal with housing law on a daily basis.  Evidently, they all 
turned a blind eye to the law while lining their pockets off people 
whose income isn't enough for they to buy their dwelling just yet. 

Every landowner in the city must repay all illegal rent increases, 
for the past six years.  In addition to this, they must repay the 
money with interest and penalties.  Their claims that there is a 13-
month limit to refund illegal rent increases is patently false.  
State law provides for a six year statute of limitation to sue for 
fraud or for contract breaches -- which is exactly what's going on 
here!  This law cannot be overriden by local officials who want to 
pass rules saying they are immunized from their own illegal conduct 
if they are not caught within 13 months.

These landowners must also turn themselves into the police, so that 
the police can decide how to proceed.  There are state laws against 
fraud and there are laws against theft by deception.  From what it 
seems, these landlords expressly or implicitly told tenants that the 
rents they were being charged were lawful.  As the Rutgers watchdog 
group has already proven, however, these statements were false, as 
the rent was not in a lawful amount.

As for other city government officials: they also turned a blind eye 
to the fact that they only have 4,132 registration forms on file out 
of 7,000 rental units in the city (a fact confirmed by the U.S. 
Census data).  Of these 4,132 registrations, how many of them include 
requests to charge excess rent (i.e. the requirement that Bishop 
Street Investors violated).  How is such gross incompetence 
possible?  While it is good to see that they will be computerizing 
their records in the future, what about the past abuses?  How will 
the city help tenants who have been robbed recover their money?  They 
now say they want to do some seminars?  Where were they for the past 
six years?  Someone has to be punished for this!

<pre>I won't be surprised if this far too lengthy message goes unread by 
most people, Joe. Anyway, I just want to point out that members of 
the House and Senate intelligence committees received the same 
briefings and reports that the White House received and that the 
infamous August 8th memo that critics point out as the White House 
knowing beforehand the September 11th plan pointed out that garden-
variety hijackings--those in which people demand ransom or the 
release of some of their peers--are possible, something that people 
have been aware of for many, many decades. 

Would Joe prefer that the federal government would have turned the 
U.S. into a heightened police state where civil rights and liberties 
come second to security to prevent a 9/11-like scenario? By the way, 
Joe, you still haven't answered by questions about the Egan proposal.

&gt; &gt;May 16, 2002, 19:00 PDT (FTW) -- Never in the history of scandals
&gt; &gt;involving the United States government has an attempt to conceal
&gt; &gt;criminal conduct by an administration been more transparently
&gt; &gt;dishonest or more easily exposed. On May 15 White House Press
&gt; &gt;Secretary Ari Fleischer -- while making the startling admission 
that
&gt; &gt;President Bush received CIA and FBI intelligence briefings in 
August
&gt; &gt;indicating Osama bin Laden might be planning hijackings -- told 
major
&gt; &gt;news sources including CBS News, "All appropriate action was taken
&gt; &gt;based on the threat information we had," Fleischer said. "The
&gt; &gt;president did not -- not -- receive information about the use of
&gt; &gt;airplanes as missiles by suicide bombers."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In other statements Fleischer told the press, "The president was 
also
&gt; &gt;provided information about bin Laden wanting to engage in hijacking
&gt; &gt;in the traditional pre-9-11 sense, not for the use of suicide
&gt; &gt;bombing, not for the use of an airplane as a missile." According 
to a
&gt; &gt;May 16 story by the New York Times, "Mr. Fleischer said the
&gt; &gt;information given to the president in Texas [last August], had
&gt; &gt;prompted the administration to put law enforcement agencies on
&gt; &gt;alert."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Every major position taken by an administration in full retreat and
&gt; &gt;on the defensive can be easily deconstructed and shown to be false.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For more than seven months FTW has been documenting specific 
warnings
&gt; &gt;received by the U.S. government from both foreign intelligence
&gt; &gt;services and, in one case, from Russian President Vladimir Putin,
&gt; &gt;indicating commercial airliners were going to be used by terrorists
&gt; &gt;to attack -- among other things -- the World Trade Center in the 
week
&gt; &gt;of Sept. 9. In order for Fleischer's statement to be credible he
&gt; &gt;would have to assert then that George W. Bush either ignored or was
&gt; &gt;not informed of a direct warning from a head of state and also from
&gt; &gt;the German intelligence service, the BND.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As reported in the German daily Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung (FAZ)
&gt; &gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/f_a_zeitung_story.html on
&gt; &gt;Sept. 14, the BND warned both the CIA and Israel in June that 
Middle
&gt; &gt;Eastern terrorists were "planning to hijack commercial aircraft to
&gt; &gt;use as weapons to attack important symbols of American and Israeli
&gt; &gt;culture." The story specifically referred to an electronic
&gt; &gt;eavesdropping system known as Echelon, wherein a number of 
countries
&gt; &gt;tap cell phone and electronic communications in partner countries 
and
&gt; &gt;then pool the information. The BND warnings were also passed to the
&gt; &gt;United Kingdom.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;No known denial by the BND of the accuracy of this story exists, 
and
&gt; &gt;the FAZ report indicates the information was received directly from
&gt; &gt;BND sources.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;According to a Sept. 14 report in the Internet newswire online.ie,
&gt; &gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/online_ie_story.html 
German
&gt; &gt;police, monitoring the phone calls of a jailed Iranian man, learned
&gt; &gt;the man was telephoning U.S. intelligence agencies last summer to
&gt; &gt;warn of an imminent attack on the World Trade Center in the week of
&gt; &gt;Sept. 9. German officials confirmed the calls to the U.S. 
government
&gt; &gt;for the story but refused to discuss additional details.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;According to a story in Izvestia on Sept. 12, Russian intelligence
&gt; &gt;warned the U.S. last summer that as many as 25 suicide pilots were
&gt; &gt;training for suicide missions involving the crashing of airliners
&gt; &gt;into important targets.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In an MSNBC interview on Sept. 15, Russian President Putin stated 
he
&gt; &gt;had ordered Russian intelligence to warn the U.S. government "in 
the
&gt; &gt;strongest possible terms" of imminent assaults on airports and
&gt; &gt;government buildings before the attacks on Sept. 11. No credible
&gt; &gt;information has emerged from any source indicating that Putin 
omitted
&gt; &gt;the above information when issuing the warning.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Many other direct warnings were received by the U.S. government and
&gt; &gt;have been documented in FTW's 9-11 timeline located at:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/02_11_02_lucy.html.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;These stories give the immediate lie to Fleischer's statements that
&gt; &gt;Bush had no inkling of airliners being used as weapons.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But there is more.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In 1996 -- as reported by the German paper Die Welt on Dec. 6, and 
by
&gt; &gt;Agence France Presse on Dec. 7 -- Western intelligence services,
&gt; &gt;including the CIA, learned after arrests in the Philippines that Al
&gt; &gt;Qaeda operatives had planned to crash commercial airliners into the
&gt; &gt;Twin Towers. Details of the plan, as reported by a number of 
American
&gt; &gt;press outlets, were found on a computer seized during the arrests.
&gt; &gt;The plan was called "Operation Bojinka." Details of the plot were
&gt; &gt;disclosed publicly in 1997 in the New York trial of Ramsi Youssef 
for
&gt; &gt;his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;FBI MEMOS TRIGGER WHITE HOUSE BACKSTEPPING
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In "traditional" hijackings the hijackers have no need or desire to
&gt; &gt;learn how to fly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As reported by the New York Times, CNN and the Washington Post 
(among
&gt; &gt;others) the events leading to Fleischer's statements were the 
recent
&gt; &gt;disclosure of FBI memoranda originated by field agents in Arizona 
and
&gt; &gt;Minnesota that warned of a possible hijack attempt by bin Laden's
&gt; &gt;followers. In both cases the suspects were taking flight lessons.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;According to Newsweek and the New York Times, FBI agents in Phoenix
&gt; &gt;submitted a classified memorandum in July naming Osama bin Laden 
and
&gt; &gt;tracking the activities of possible Middle Eastern terrorist 
suspects
&gt; &gt;who had enrolled in local flight schools. The memo, according to 
the
&gt; &gt;Times, stated bin Laden's followers "could use the schools to train
&gt; &gt;for terror operations." The information in the Phoenix memo was not
&gt; &gt;shared with FBI field agents in Minnesota who had uncovered other
&gt; &gt;startling evidence.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Just days before the attacks in early-September, FBI agents in
&gt; &gt;Minnesota wrote notes that subsequently became included in an
&gt; &gt;internal FBI document warning that accused terrorist Zacarias
&gt; &gt;Moussaoui "might be planning on flying something into the World 
Trade
&gt; &gt;Center." A story from the May 20 issue of Newsweek by Michael 
Isikoff
&gt; &gt;described how a local flight instructor had reported Moussaoui
&gt; &gt;had "showed a suspicious interest in learning how to steer [and not
&gt; &gt;land] large airlinersThe [FBI] agents were `in a frenzy, 
absolutely
&gt; &gt;convinced he was planning to so something with a plane.'"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A multitude of sources have reported the FBI agents requested a
&gt; &gt;warrant to search Moussaoui's personal computer but were denied by
&gt; &gt;Attorney General John Ashcroft's Justice Department. After the 9-11
&gt; &gt;attacks the computer was seized and found to contain information
&gt; &gt;directly related to the World Trade Center attacks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This apparent lack of support from within the administration is
&gt; &gt;consistent with reports released last fall by the BBC's Gregg 
Palast
&gt; &gt;showing that in January 2001 the Bush Administration had issued
&gt; &gt;direct orders to the FBI to curtail investigations of two of Osama
&gt; &gt;bin Laden's relatives, Omar and Abdullah bin Laden. The two bin
&gt; &gt;Ladens had been connected to possible terrorist activities and were
&gt; &gt;living in Falls Church, Va., near CIA headquarters.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;APPROPRIATE WARNINGS?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Fleischer's statement that adequate warnings had been given to
&gt; &gt;appropriate federal agencies falls flat on its face. Two of the
&gt; &gt;most "appropriate" agencies would have been the Federal Aviation
&gt; &gt;Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As documented by researchers like Jared Israel at www.tenc.net, it
&gt; &gt;has been standard FAA procedure for more than 25 years to scramble
&gt; &gt;U.S. fighters to intercept -- not shoot down -- any errant or non-
&gt; &gt;responsive aircraft under FAA control. This protocol is even more
&gt; &gt;stringent in the case of a hijacking. Yet, Vice President Dick 
Cheney
&gt; &gt;and others have stated publicly there were no fighters available in
&gt; &gt;some cases, and there was no heightened state of alert on Sept. 11.
&gt; &gt;For 50 minutes on 9-11, in direct contravention of established
&gt; &gt;policy, no fighters were scrambled to intercept two outstanding
&gt; &gt;hijacked airliners even though it was known attacks were in 
progress.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Given the above information, it would have been an obvious move to
&gt; &gt;have placed fighter aircraft on a heightened state of alert in this
&gt; &gt;time period. This unresponsiveness stands in contrast to the fact
&gt; &gt;that, in October 1999 at a time when there was no heightened alert,
&gt; &gt;the ill-fated Lear Jet occupied by golfer Payne Stewart had an F-16
&gt; &gt;fighter and an A-10 attack aircraft flying beside it within minutes
&gt; &gt;of losing radio contact and veering off course.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;INSIDER TRADING
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;FTW has spent months on this important story that proves
&gt; &gt;foreknowledge of the attacks by people who also profited from them.
&gt; &gt;This was a glaring warning signal, since such trades ran the risk 
of
&gt; &gt;being detected by intelligence agencies that routinely monitor all
&gt; &gt;market activity in real time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The insider trading involves the placement of large numbers 
of "put"
&gt; &gt;options on stocks of companies directly affected by the Sept. 11
&gt; &gt;attacks. They include United Air Lines, American Air Lines, Morgan
&gt; &gt;Stanley, Merrill Lynch, AXA Reinsurance, Munich Reinsurance and 
Swiss
&gt; &gt;Reinsurance. Put options are a leveraged bet that a stock's price
&gt; &gt;will fall dramatically.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As CBS news noted on Sept. 26, the peak of trading activity 
occurred
&gt; &gt;just before the attacks. There was a jump in United Air Lines put
&gt; &gt;options 90 times (not 90 percent) above normal between Sept. 6 and
&gt; &gt;Sept.10, and 285 times higher than average on Sept. 6. Numbers for
&gt; &gt;other affected stocks were equally alarming. It is uncontested that
&gt; &gt;only United and American stocks had this level of put buying before
&gt; &gt;the attacks. No other airlines were affected.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A May 13 story by the Washington Times' Insight Magazine attempted 
to
&gt; &gt;explain the insider trading by stating higher numbers of put 
options
&gt; &gt;had been placed on United and American stocks earlier in 2001. By
&gt; &gt;relying only on the numbers of put options, Insight asserted that
&gt; &gt;there was nothing unusual about the pre-9-11 trades.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;However, FTW has contacted several experienced traders and reviewed
&gt; &gt;existing documentation from financial experts, which indicate the
&gt; &gt;alarm for insider trading is to look for any "imbalance" between 
the
&gt; &gt;level of put options (a bet that a stock's price will fall) and the
&gt; &gt;level of call options (a bet that a stock's price will rise). It 
is a
&gt; &gt;significant imbalance in puts vs. calls that indicates criminal
&gt; &gt;insider trading. The Insight piece did not address this point.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Several traders have stated that in a fairly flat market with high
&gt; &gt;trading volumes, it has been a routine procedure for experienced
&gt; &gt;traders to place roughly equal numbers of puts and calls on various
&gt; &gt;stocks in order to generate a paper cash flow. They were quick to
&gt; &gt;point out that by September, the market had gone into sharp decline
&gt; &gt;and trading volumes were way down. Thus, lower numbers of put 
options
&gt; &gt;did not mean that everything was normal. They stressed it was the
&gt; &gt;imbalance in put-to-call ratios that signaled the insider trading.
&gt; &gt;[Ed. Note: FTW has undertaken a more detailed investigation of this
&gt; &gt;trading activity and hopes to have a more comprehensive report 
within
&gt; &gt;4-6 weeks].
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Part of the problem in Insight's research stems from the fact that
&gt; &gt;since Sept. 11, there has been no transparency from either the
&gt; &gt;government or the financial sector on how the trades worked or how
&gt; &gt;the markets tracked them. Secrecy is everywhere. Telephone calls 
have
&gt; &gt;not been returned, and the government refuses to divulge any
&gt; &gt;information about probes it admits are still ongoing. But 
simplistic
&gt; &gt;dismissals from sources quoted in the Insight story contradict not
&gt; &gt;only other evidence, but statements made by financial experts and
&gt; &gt;major news sources just after the attacks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;"This could very well be insider trading at the worst, most 
horrific,
&gt; &gt;most evil use you've ever seen in your entire lifeThis would be 
one
&gt; &gt;of the most extraordinary coincidences in the history of mankind if
&gt; &gt;it was a coincidence," said Dylan Ratigan of Bloomberg Business 
News,
&gt; &gt;interviewed Sept. 20 on Good Morning Texas.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;"'I saw put-call numbers higher than I've ever seen in 10 years of
&gt; &gt;following the markets, particularly the options markets,' said John
&gt; &gt;Kinnucan, principal of Broadband Research, as quoted in the San
&gt; &gt;Francisco Chronicle," reported the Montreal Gazette on Sept. 19.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;To quote 60 Minutes from Sept. 19, "Sources tell CBS News that the
&gt; &gt;afternoon before the attack, alarm bells were sounding over unusual
&gt; &gt;trading in the U.S. stock options market."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Assertions that the reported number of puts involved were not
&gt; &gt;abnormal also failed to analyze highly intricate shell games that
&gt; &gt;involve the movement of put options to markets outside the U.S. or
&gt; &gt;hidden in what traders refer to as "net positions." Serious 
financial
&gt; &gt;experts have indicated the profits from insider trading could have
&gt; &gt;been in the billions. Andreas von Bulow, a former member of the
&gt; &gt;German parliament responsible for oversight of Germany's 
intelligence
&gt; &gt;services, estimated the worldwide amount at $15 billion, according 
to
&gt; &gt;Tagesspiegel on Jan. 13. Other experts have estimated the amount at
&gt; &gt;$12 billion. CBS News gave a conservative estimate of $100 million.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A hasty conclusion reached by many is the insider trades were 
placed
&gt; &gt;by bin Laden and his associates. Such a notion is flatly 
contradicted
&gt; &gt;by the now absolute certainty that such insider trades would have -
-
&gt; &gt;and apparently did -- set off alarm bells. It makes little sense to
&gt; &gt;argue bin Laden et al would have risked compromising at the last
&gt; &gt;minute an operation planned in total secrecy for at least four 
years.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Also lacking credibility is the argument that many of the trades 
were
&gt; &gt;what some brokers described as inconsequential amounts valued at $1
&gt; &gt;million or $2 million. This does not address the possibility that
&gt; &gt;U.S. intelligence officials decided in a few cases to make a quick
&gt; &gt;profit from attacks they knew were going to succeed. As distasteful
&gt; &gt;as it may seem, this explanation is far more credible than an
&gt; &gt;assumption that bin Laden made the trades himself and risked the
&gt; &gt;exposure of what the world has been led to believe was his
&gt; &gt;life's "masterpiece."

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The explanations offered by the Bush Administration over the last 
48
&gt; &gt;hours will not withstand even the slightest scrutiny if a major 
press
&gt; &gt;organization asks any question about the warnings received from
&gt; &gt;credible foreign government sources and heads of state. Other
&gt; &gt;questions must inevitably follow that will implode an oil
&gt; &gt;dictatorship whose sins and crimes are exposed and just waiting for
&gt; &gt;someone to pick them up and run with them.

&gt; &gt;airplanes as missiles by suicide bombers."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In other statements Fleischer told the press, "The president was 
also
&gt; &gt;provided information about bin Laden wanting to engage in hijacking
&gt; &gt;in the traditional pre-9-11 sense, not for the use of suicide
&gt; &gt;bombing, not for the use of an airplane as a missile." According 
to a
&gt; &gt;May 16 story by the New York Times, "Mr. Fleischer said the
&gt; &gt;information given to the president in Texas [last August], had
&gt; &gt;prompted the administration to put law enforcement agencies on
&gt; &gt;alert."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Every major position taken by an administration in full retreat and
&gt; &gt;on the defensive can be easily deconstructed and shown to be false.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For more than seven months FTW has been documenting specific 
warnings
&gt; &gt;received by the U.S. government from both foreign intelligence
&gt; &gt;services and, in one case, from Russian President Vladimir Putin,
&gt; &gt;indicating commercial airliners were going to be used by terrorists
&gt; &gt;to attack -- among other things -- the World Trade Center in the 
week
&gt; &gt;of Sept. 9. In order for Fleischer's statement to be credible he
&gt; &gt;would have to assert then that George W. Bush either ignored or was
&gt; &gt;not informed of a direct warning from a head of state and also from
&gt; &gt;the German intelligence service, the BND.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As reported in the German daily Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung (FAZ)
&gt; &gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/f_a_zeitung_story.html on
&gt; &gt;Sept. 14, the BND warned both the CIA and Israel in June that 
Middle
&gt; &gt;Eastern terrorists were "planning to hijack commercial aircraft to
&gt; &gt;use as weapons to attack important symbols of American and Israeli
&gt; &gt;culture." The story specifically referred to an electronic
&gt; &gt;eavesdropping system known as Echelon, wherein a number of 
countries
&gt; &gt;tap cell phone and electronic communications in partner countries 
and
&gt; &gt;then pool the information. The BND warnings were also passed to the
&gt; &gt;United Kingdom.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;No known denial by the BND of the accuracy of this story exists, 
and
&gt; &gt;the FAZ report indicates the information was received directly from
&gt; &gt;BND sources.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;According to a Sept. 14 report in the Internet newswire online.ie,
&gt; &gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/online_ie_story.html 
German
&gt; &gt;police, monitoring the phone calls of a jailed Iranian man, learned
&gt; &gt;the man was telephoning U.S. intelligence agencies last summer to
&gt; &gt;warn of an imminent attack on the World Trade Center in the week of
&gt; &gt;Sept. 9. German officials confirmed the calls to the U.S. 
government
&gt; &gt;for the story but refused to discuss additional details.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;According to a story in Izvestia on Sept. 12, Russian intelligence
&gt; &gt;warned the U.S. last summer that as many as 25 suicide pilots were
&gt; &gt;training for suicide missions involving the crashing of airliners
&gt; &gt;into important targets.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In an MSNBC interview on Sept. 15, Russian President Putin stated 
he
&gt; &gt;had ordered Russian intelligence to warn the U.S. government "in 
the
&gt; &gt;strongest possible terms" of imminent assaults on airports and
&gt; &gt;government buildings before the attacks on Sept. 11. No credible
&gt; &gt;information has emerged from any source indicating that Putin 
omitted
&gt; &gt;the above information when issuing the warning.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Many other direct warnings were received by the U.S. government and
&gt; &gt;have been documented in FTW's 9-11 timeline located at:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/02_11_02_lucy.html.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;These stories give the immediate lie to Fleischer's statements that
&gt; &gt;Bush had no inkling of airliners being used as weapons.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But there is more.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In 1996 -- as reported by the German paper Die Welt on Dec. 6, and 
by
&gt; &gt;Agence France Presse on Dec. 7 -- Western intelligence services,
&gt; &gt;including the CIA, learned after arrests in the Philippines that Al
&gt; &gt;Qaeda operatives had planned to crash commercial airliners into the
&gt; &gt;Twin Towers. Details of the plan, as reported by a number of 
American
&gt; &gt;press outlets, were found on a computer seized during the arrests.
&gt; &gt;The plan was called "Operation Bojinka." Details of the plot were
&gt; &gt;disclosed publicly in 1997 in the New York trial of Ramsi Youssef 
for
&gt; &gt;his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;FBI MEMOS TRIGGER WHITE HOUSE BACKSTEPPING
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In "traditional" hijackings the hijackers have no need or desire to
&gt; &gt;learn how to fly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As reported by the New York Times, CNN and the Washington Post 
(among
&gt; &gt;others) the events leading to Fleischer's statements were the 
recent
&gt; &gt;disclosure of FBI memoranda originated by field agents in Arizona 
and
&gt; &gt;Minnesota that warned of a possible hijack attempt by bin Laden's
&gt; &gt;followers. In both cases the suspects were taking flight lessons.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;According to Newsweek and the New York Times, FBI agents in Phoenix
&gt; &gt;submitted a classified memorandum in July naming Osama bin Laden 
and
&gt; &gt;tracking the activities of possible Middle Eastern terrorist 
suspects
&gt; &gt;who had enrolled in local flight schools. The memo, according to 
the
&gt; &gt;Times, stated bin Laden's followers "could use the schools to train
&gt; &gt;for terror operations." The information in the Phoenix memo was not
&gt; &gt;shared with FBI field agents in Minnesota who had uncovered other
&gt; &gt;startling evidence.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Just days before the attacks in early-September, FBI agents in
&gt; &gt;Minnesota wrote notes that subsequently became included in an
&gt; &gt;internal FBI document warning that accused terrorist Zacarias
&gt; &gt;Moussaoui "might be planning on flying something into the World 
Trade
&gt; &gt;Center." A story from the May 20 issue of Newsweek by Michael 
Isikoff
&gt; &gt;described how a local flight instructor had reported Moussaoui
&gt; &gt;had "showed a suspicious interest in learning how to steer [and not
&gt; &gt;land] large airlinersThe [FBI] agents were `in a frenzy, 
absolutely
&gt; &gt;convinced he was planning to so something with a plane.'"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A multitude of sources have reported the FBI agents requested a
&gt; &gt;warrant to search Moussaoui's personal computer but were denied by
&gt; &gt;Attorney General John Ashcroft's Justice Department. After the 9-11
&gt; &gt;attacks the computer was seized and found to contain information
&gt; &gt;directly related to the World Trade Center attacks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This apparent lack of support from within the administration is
&gt; &gt;consistent with reports released last fall by the BBC's Gregg 
Palast
&gt; &gt;showing that in January 2001 the Bush Administration had issued
&gt; &gt;direct orders to the FBI to curtail investigations of two of Osama
&gt; &gt;bin Laden's relatives, Omar and Abdullah bin Laden. The two bin
&gt; &gt;Ladens had been connected to possible terrorist activities and were
&gt; &gt;living in Falls Church, Va., near CIA headquarters.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;APPROPRIATE WARNINGS?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Fleischer's statement that adequate warnings had been given to
&gt; &gt;appropriate federal agencies falls flat on its face. Two of the
&gt; &gt;most "appropriate" agencies would have been the Federal Aviation
&gt; &gt;Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As documented by researchers like Jared Israel at www.tenc.net, it
&gt; &gt;has been standard FAA procedure for more than 25 years to scramble
&gt; &gt;U.S. fighters to intercept -- not shoot down -- any errant or non-
&gt; &gt;responsive aircraft under FAA control. This protocol is even more
&gt; &gt;stringent in the case of a hijacking. Yet, Vice President Dick 
Cheney
&gt; &gt;and others have stated publicly there were no fighters available in
&gt; &gt;some cases, and there was no heightened state of alert on Sept. 11.
&gt; &gt;For 50 minutes on 9-11, in direct contravention of established
&gt; &gt;policy, no fighters were scrambled to intercept two outstanding
&gt; &gt;hijacked airliners even though it was known attacks were in 
progress.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Given the above information, it would have been an obvious move to
&gt; &gt;have placed fighter aircraft on a heightened state of alert in this
&gt; &gt;time period. This unresponsiveness stands in contrast to the fact
&gt; &gt;that, in October 1999 at a time when there was no heightened alert,
&gt; &gt;the ill-fated Lear Jet occupied by golfer Payne Stewart had an F-16
&gt; &gt;fighter and an A-10 attack aircraft flying beside it within minutes
&gt; &gt;of losing radio contact and veering off course.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;INSIDER TRADING
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;FTW has spent months on this important story that proves
&gt; &gt;foreknowledge of the attacks by people who also profited from them.
&gt; &gt;This was a glaring warning signal, since such trades ran the risk 
of
&gt; &gt;being detected by intelligence agencies that routinely monitor all
&gt; &gt;market activity in real time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The insider trading involves the placement of large numbers 
of "put"
&gt; &gt;options on stocks of companies directly affected by the Sept. 11
&gt; &gt;attacks. They include United Air Lines, American Air Lines, Morgan
&gt; &gt;Stanley, Merrill Lynch, AXA Reinsurance, Munich Reinsurance and 
Swiss
&gt; &gt;Reinsurance. Put options are a leveraged bet that a stock's price
&gt; &gt;will fall dramatically.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As CBS news noted on Sept. 26, the peak of trading activity 
occurred
&gt; &gt;just before the attacks. There was a jump in United Air Lines put
&gt; &gt;options 90 times (not 90 percent) above normal between Sept. 6 and
&gt; &gt;Sept.10, and 285 times higher than average on Sept. 6. Numbers for
&gt; &gt;other affected stocks were equally alarming. It is uncontested that
&gt; &gt;only United and American stocks had this level of put buying before
&gt; &gt;the attacks. No other airlines were affected.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A May 13 story by the Washington Times' Insight Magazine attempted 
to
&gt; &gt;explain the insider trading by stating higher numbers of put 
options
&gt; &gt;had been placed on United and American stocks earlier in 2001. By
&gt; &gt;relying only on the numbers of put options, Insight asserted that
&gt; &gt;there was nothing unusual about the pre-9-11 trades.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;However, FTW has contacted several experienced traders and reviewed
&gt; &gt;existing documentation from financial experts, which indicate the
&gt; &gt;alarm for insider trading is to look for any "imbalance" between 
the
&gt; &gt;level of put options (a bet that a stock's price will fall) and the
&gt; &gt;level of call options (a bet that a stock's price will rise). It 
is a
&gt; &gt;significant imbalance in puts vs. calls that indicates criminal
&gt; &gt;insider trading. The Insight piece did not address this point.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Several traders have stated that in a fairly flat market with high
&gt; &gt;trading volumes, it has been a routine procedure for experienced
&gt; &gt;traders to place roughly equal numbers of puts and calls on various
&gt; &gt;stocks in order to generate a paper cash flow. They were quick to
&gt; &gt;point out that by September, the market had gone into sharp decline
&gt; &gt;and trading volumes were way down. Thus, lower numbers of put 
options
&gt; &gt;did not mean that everything was normal. They stressed it was the
&gt; &gt;imbalance in put-to-call ratios that signaled the insider trading.
&gt; &gt;[Ed. Note: FTW has undertaken a more detailed investigation of this
&gt; &gt;trading activity and hopes to have a more comprehensive report 
within
&gt; &gt;4-6 weeks].
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Part of the problem in Insight's research stems from the fact that
&gt; &gt;since Sept. 11, there has been no transparency from either the
&gt; &gt;government or the financial sector on how the trades worked or how
&gt; &gt;the markets tracked them. Secrecy is everywhere. Telephone calls 
have
&gt; &gt;not been returned, and the government refuses to divulge any
&gt; &gt;information about probes it admits are still ongoing. But 
simplistic
&gt; &gt;dismissals from sources quoted in the Insight story contradict not
&gt; &gt;only other evidence, but statements made by financial experts and
&gt; &gt;major news sources just after the attacks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;"This could very well be insider trading at the worst, most 
horrific,
&gt; &gt;most evil use you've ever seen in your entire lifeThis would be 
one
&gt; &gt;of the most extraordinary coincidences in the history of mankind if
&gt; &gt;it was a coincidence," said Dylan Ratigan of Bloomberg Business 
News,
&gt; &gt;interviewed Sept. 20 on Good Morning Texas.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;"'I saw put-call numbers higher than I've ever seen in 10 years of
&gt; &gt;following the markets, particularly the options markets,' said John
&gt; &gt;Kinnucan, principal of Broadband Research, as quoted in the San
&gt; &gt;Francisco Chronicle," reported the Montreal Gazette on Sept. 19.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;To quote 60 Minutes from Sept. 19, "Sources tell CBS News that the
&gt; &gt;afternoon before the attack, alarm bells were sounding over unusual
&gt; &gt;trading in the U.S. stock options market."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Assertions that the reported number of puts involved were not
&gt; &gt;abnormal also failed to analyze highly intricate shell games that
&gt; &gt;involve the movement of put options to markets outside the U.S. or
&gt; &gt;hidden in what traders refer to as "net positions." Serious 
financial
&gt; &gt;experts have indicated the profits from insider trading could have
&gt; &gt;been in the billions. Andreas von Bulow, a former member of the
&gt; &gt;German parliament responsible for oversight of Germany's 
intelligence
&gt; &gt;services, estimated the worldwide amount at $15 billion, according 
to
&gt; &gt;Tagesspiegel on Jan. 13. Other experts have estimated the amount at
&gt; &gt;$12 billion. CBS News gave a conservative estimate of $100 million.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A hasty conclusion reached by many is the insider trades were 
placed
&gt; &gt;by bin Laden and his associates. Such a notion is flatly 
contradicted
&gt; &gt;by the now absolute certainty that such insider trades would have -
-
&gt; &gt;and apparently did -- set off alarm bells. It makes little sense to
&gt; &gt;argue bin Laden et al would have risked compromising at the last
&gt; &gt;minute an operation planned in total secrecy for at least four 
years.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Also lacking credibility is the argument that many of the trades 
were
&gt; &gt;what some brokers described as inconsequential amounts valued at $1
&gt; &gt;million or $2 million. This does not address the possibility that
&gt; &gt;U.S. intelligence officials decided in a few cases to make a quick
&gt; &gt;profit from attacks they knew were going to succeed. As distasteful
&gt; &gt;as it may seem, this explanation is far more credible than an
&gt; &gt;assumption that bin Laden made the trades himself and risked the
&gt; &gt;exposure of what the world has been led to believe was his
&gt; &gt;life's "masterpiece."
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The explanations offered by the Bush Administration over the last 
48
&gt; &gt;hours will not withstand even the slightest scrutiny if a major 
press
&gt; &gt;organization asks any question about the warnings received from
&gt; &gt;credible foreign government sources and heads of state. Other
&gt; &gt;questions must inevitably follow that will implode an oil
&gt; &gt;dictatorship whose sins and crimes are exposed and just waiting for
&gt; &gt;someone to pick them up and run with them.

Subject:Fwd:  3 Florida counties to face federal vote suit<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>&gt;From: "Voter March" &lt;lposner1@...&gt;


&gt;Miami Herald, May 22, 2002
&gt;3 Florida counties to face federal vote suit
&gt;BY PETER WALLSTEN, LESLEY CLARK AND ANDREA ROBINSON
&gt;pwallsten@...
&gt;
&gt;U.S.: 2000 election harmed minorities
&gt;
&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is preparing to sue three Florida counties for 
&gt;allegedly disenfranchising minorities and other voters during the state's 
&gt;bitterly contested 2000 presidential election.
&gt;
&gt;Lawsuits in Florida and two other states will be based on complaints from 
&gt;more than 11,000 people, an agency official told the U.S. Senate Judiciary 
&gt;Committee on Tuesday.
&gt;
&gt;The official, Assistant Attorney General Ralph Boyd, said the suits would 
&gt;be filed in 30 to 60 days, but he declined to say which Florida counties 
&gt;were being targeted. The department also plans to sue some cities in 
&gt;Missouri and Tennessee.
&gt;
&gt;Miami-Dade County is one of the counties in talks with the Justice 
&gt;Department, county attorney Robert Ginsburg said.
&gt;
&gt;County officials have discussed how they could help Haitian Americans cast 
&gt;their ballots, he said. ``We've been talking to the Justice Department 
&gt;along those lines and working with them to see what would make sense.''
&gt;
&gt;He said county officials will meet with Justice lawyers in the next week or 
&gt;two. ''I think it's going to be resolved amicably. I think it may have been 
&gt;already, I'm not entirely sure. But they're going to come down and talk to 
&gt;us about that,'' Ginsburg said.
&gt;
&gt;The Florida suits would cover a variety of allegations, including improper 
&gt;purging of state voter rolls, inadequate access for voters with 
&gt;disabilities, difficulties experienced by minorities and a lack of 
&gt;assistance for some non-English speakers.
&gt;
&gt;Boyd said that the targeted counties are cooperating, and that a settlement 
&gt;could be negotiated with time to spare before the Sept. 10 primaries in 
&gt;Florida. He said the Florida counties have acknowledged ``certain 
&gt;deficiencies we have identified.''
&gt;
&gt;''My hope, my aspiration and my expectation is that in each of those we'll 
&gt;reach an enforceable agreement prior to the filing of the lawsuit,'' Boyd 
&gt;said.
&gt;
&gt;Florida's electoral system came under international scrutiny in the days 
&gt;following the November 2000 election.
&gt;
&gt;As lawyers for George W. Bush and Al Gore argued the election results in 
&gt;state and federal courts, civil rights activists from the Rev. Jesse 
&gt;Jackson to Joseph Lowery, former president of the Southern Christian 
&gt;Leadership Conference, joined a growing chorus of complaints that thousands 
&gt;of voters were robbed of their rights to vote.
&gt;
&gt;Some charged that Gore, a Democrat, would have won if not for the 
&gt;violations.
&gt;
&gt;After the election debacle, Florida lawmakers overhauled the state's voting 
&gt;system, eliminating punch-card and hand-counted paper ballots and 
&gt;mechanical lever voting. The state required all counties to have 
&gt;optical-scan ballot systems or touch-screen voting machines in time for the 
&gt;2002 primary election this September.
&gt;
&gt;Civil rights groups have filed lawsuits over disenfranchised voters against 
&gt;seven Florida counties: Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Leon, Miami-Dade, 
&gt;Orange and Volusia counties. Broward and Leon counties have settled and a 
&gt;federal judge has asked the civil rights groups to pursue mediation with 
&gt;the remaining counties.
&gt;
&gt;Several groups, as well as dozens of black members of Congress, have 
&gt;alleged that black voters were kept from voting in Florida and other states 
&gt;on Election Day and ballots of others were systematically discarded.
&gt;
&gt;Some Hispanic voters in Florida also alleged that they were required to 
&gt;produce two kinds of identification when only one was required and that 
&gt;they were confused by their ballots.
&gt;
&gt;It was clear late Tuesday that many of the critics were not prepared to 
&gt;trust an investigation by Bush-appointed Attorney General John Ashcroft.
&gt;
&gt;''We just have to wait til we get the facts,'' U.S. Sen. John Edwards, a 
&gt;North Carolina Democrat who questioned Boyd during the committee meeting, 
&gt;told The Herald.
&gt;
&gt;``Without knowing exactly what the lawsuits do or what any settlement 
&gt;agreement would contain, it's impossible to know how effective it would 
&gt;be.''
&gt;
&gt;Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, who was Gore's state campaign 
&gt;chairman, noted that Florida legislators and county election supervisors 
&gt;have already worked furiously to resolve the problems, making Ashcroft a 
&gt;late comer. ''It's nice they're coming in and wanting to sue, but I think 
&gt;the Florida supervisors by and large have done a lot to correct the 
&gt;problems we had in 2000,'' he said. ``It's nice when you find out which way 
&gt;the parade is going to go out there and try to lead it.''

Subject:Fwd: Case for 9/11 Probe<br>
Message:<br><br>

&gt;
&gt;The Case for Bush Administration Advance Knowledge of 9-11 Attacks
&gt;
&gt;WARNINGS FROM FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
&gt;
&gt;This section focuses on known advance warnings received by the U.S.
&gt;government from foreign intelligence services that proved to be specific
&gt;enough to have identified the date (within one week), method, targets, and
&gt;perpetrators of the attacks. It will not include warnings issued to the USG
&gt;that could be considered vague or non-specific. The latter includes
&gt;documented warnings sent by the governments of Egypt and Israel. However, 
&gt;in
&gt;light of the specific warnings, these additional warnings add greater 
&gt;weight
&gt;to the argument that the Administration was in possession of sufficient
&gt;information to have prevented the attacks.
&gt;
&gt;As reported in the respected German daily Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung
&gt;(FAZ) on Sept. 13, the German intelligence service, the BND, warned both 
&gt;the
&gt;CIA and Israel in June of 2001 that Middle Eastern terrorists were 
&gt;"planning
&gt;to hijack commercial aircraft to use as weapons to attack important symbols
&gt;of American and Israeli culture." The story specifically referred to an
&gt;electronic eavesdropping system known as Echelon, wherein a number of
&gt;countries tap cell phone and electronic communications in partner countries
&gt;and then pool the information. The BND warnings were also passed to the
&gt;United Kingdom.
&gt;
&gt;No known denial by the BND of the accuracy of this story exists, and the 
&gt;FAZ
&gt;story indicates that the information was received directly from BND 
&gt;sources.
&gt;
&gt;According to a Sept. 14 report in the Internet newswire online.de, German
&gt;police, monitoring the phone calls of a jailed Iranian man, learned the man
&gt;was telephoning USG intelligence agencies last summer to warn of an 
&gt;imminent
&gt;attack on the WTC in the week of Sept. 9. German officials confirmed the
&gt;calls to the USG for the story but refused to discuss additional details.
&gt;In August 2000 French intelligence sources confirmed a man recently 
&gt;arrested
&gt;in Boston by the FBI was an Islamic militant and a key member of Osama bin
&gt;Laden�s Al Qaeda network. The FBI knew the man had been taking flying
&gt;lessons at the time of his arrest and was in possession of technical
&gt;information on Boeing aircraft and flight manuals, as reported by Reuters 
&gt;on
&gt;Sept. 13.
&gt;
&gt;According to a story in Izveztia on Sept. 12, Russian intelligence warned
&gt;the USG that as many as 25 suicide pilots were training for suicide 
&gt;missions
&gt;involving the crashing of airliners into important targets.
&gt;
&gt;In an MSNBC interview on Sept. 15, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated
&gt;he had ordered Russian intelligence to warn the USG "in the strongest
&gt;possible terms" of imminent assaults on airports and government buildings
&gt;before the attacks on Sept. 11.
&gt;
&gt;Conclusion: From just these five press stories, then, the USG had received
&gt;credible advance warnings, some from heads of state, that commercial
&gt;aircraft would be hijacked by as many as 25 suicide pilots at airports, 
&gt;with
&gt;Boston a strong candidate, during the week of Sept. 9. The call to Odigo
&gt;would have signaled the exact day.
&gt;
&gt;No known preventive measures were taken.
&gt;
&gt;INSIDER TRADING
&gt;
&gt;The documented pre-Sept. 11 insider trading that occurred before the 
&gt;attacks
&gt;involved only companies hit hard by the attacks. They include United
&gt;Airlines, American Airlines, Morgan Stanley, Merrill-Lynch, Axa 
&gt;Reinsurance,
&gt;Marsh &amp; McLennan, Munich Reinsurance, Swiss Reinsurance, and Citigroup.
&gt;
&gt;In order to argue that the massive and well-documented insider trading that
&gt;occurred in at least seven countries immediately before the attacks of 
&gt;Sept.
&gt;11 did not serve as a warning to intelligence agencies, then it is 
&gt;necessary
&gt;to argue that no one was aware of the trades as they were occurring, and
&gt;that intelligence and law enforcement agencies of most industrialized
&gt;nations do not monitor stock trades in real time to warn of impending
&gt;attacks. Both assertions are false. Both assertions would also ignore the
&gt;fact that the current executive vice president of the New York Stock
&gt;Exchange (NYSE) for enforcement is David Doherty, a retired CIA general
&gt;counsel. And also ignored is the fact that the trading in United Airlines
&gt;stock -- one of the most glaring clues -- was placed through the firm
&gt;Deutschebank/Alex Brown, which was headed until 1998 by the man who is now
&gt;the executive director of the CIA, A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard.
&gt;
&gt;One wonders if it was a coincidence then, that Mayo Shattuck III, the head
&gt;of the Alex Brown unit of Deutschebank -- which had its offices in the WTC
&gt;-- suddenly resigned from a $30 million, three-year contract on Sept. 12, 
&gt;as
&gt;reported by the New York Times and other papers.
&gt;
&gt;The American exchanges that handle these trades, primarily the Chicago 
&gt;Board
&gt;of Options Exchange (CBOE) and the NYSE, know on a daily basis what levels
&gt;of put options are purchased. "Put options" are highly leveraged bets, 
&gt;tying
&gt;up blocks of stock, that a given stock�s share price will fall 
&gt;dramatically.
&gt;To quote 60 Minutes from Sept. 19, "Sources tell CBS News that the 
&gt;afternoon
&gt;before the attack, alarm bells were sounding over unusual trading in the
&gt;U.S. stock options market."
&gt;It is hard to believe that they missed:
&gt;
&gt;- A jump in UAL put options 90 times (not 90 percent) above normal between
&gt;Sept. 6 and Sept.10, and 285 times higher than average on the Thursday
&gt;before the attack. [CBS News, Sept. 26]
&gt;
&gt;- A jump in American Airlines put options 60 times (not 60 percent) above
&gt;normal on the day before the attacks. [CBS News, Sept. 26]
&gt;
&gt;- No similar trading occurred on any other airlines. [Bloomberg Business
&gt;Report, the Institute for Counterterrorism (ICT), Herzliyya, Israel citing
&gt;data from the CBOE]
&gt;
&gt;- Morgan Stanley saw, between Sept. 7 and Sept.10, an increase of 27 times
&gt;(not 27 percent) in the purchase of put options on its shares. [ICT Report,
&gt;"Mechanics of Possible Bin-Laden Insider Trading Scam," Sept. 21, citing
&gt;data from the CBOE].
&gt;
&gt;- Merrill-Lynch saw a jump of more than 12 times the normal level of put
&gt;options in the four trading days before the attacks. [Ibid]
&gt;
&gt;These trades were certainly noticed after the attacks.
&gt;�This could very well be insider trading at the worst, most horrific, most
&gt;evil use you�ve ever seen in your entire life"This would be one of the most
&gt;extraordinary coincidences in the history of mankind if it was a
&gt;coincidence," said Dylan Ratigan of Bloomberg Business News, interviewed on
&gt;Good Morning Texas on Sept. 20.
&gt;
&gt;" I saw put-call numbers higher than I�ve ever seen in 10 years of 
&gt;following
&gt;the markets, particularly the options markets,� said John Kinnucan,
&gt;principal of Broadband Research, as quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle,"
&gt;reported the Montreal Gazette on Sept. 19. The paper also wrote, "Agence
&gt;France Presse, on Sept. 22, reported, �And Germany�s Bundesbank chief, 
&gt;Ernst
&gt;Weltke, said on the sidelines of the meeting that a report of the
&gt;investigation showed �bizarre" fiscal transactions prior to the attacks 
&gt;that
&gt;could not have been chalked up to coincidence.
&gt;"Weltke said the transactions, �could not have been planned and carried out
&gt;without a certain knowledge, particularly heavy trading in oil and gold
&gt;futures."
&gt;
&gt;ABC World News reported on Sept. 20, "Jonathan Winer, an ABC News 
&gt;consultant
&gt;said, �it�s absolutely unprecedented to see cases of insider trading
&gt;covering the entire world from Japan, to the U.S., to North America, to
&gt;Europe."
&gt;
&gt;How much money was involved? Andreas von Bulow, a former member of the
&gt;German Parliament responsible for oversight of Germany�s intelligence
&gt;services estimated the worldwide amount at $15 billion, according to
&gt;Tagesspiegel on Jan. 13. Other experts have estimated the amount at $12
&gt;billion. CBS News gave a conservative estimate of $100 million.
&gt;
&gt;Not a single U.S. or foreign investigative agency has announced any arrests
&gt;or developments in the investigation of these trades, the most telling
&gt;evidence of foreknowledge of the attacks. This, in spite of the fact that
&gt;former Security and Exchange Commission enforcement chief William McLucas
&gt;told Bloomberg News that regulators would "certainly be able to track down
&gt;every trade."
&gt;
&gt;What is striking is that a National Public Radio report on Oct. 16 reported
&gt;Britain's Financial Services Authority had cleared bin Laden and his
&gt;henchmen of insider trading. If not bin Laden, then who else had advance
&gt;knowledge?
&gt;
&gt;It has been standard and established USG policy to be alert and responsive
&gt;to anything even remotely resembling an attack on U.S. companies and/or the
&gt;economy. The word "remote" does not apply here. The possible claim by the
&gt;Bush Administration that, �Gee, we just happened to miss this,� becomes 
&gt;even
&gt;more implausible when considering the lengths intelligence agencies go to 
&gt;in
&gt;order to track stock trades.
&gt;
&gt;Note that the Israeli Institute for Counter-Terrorism was the first entity
&gt;to release a detailed report on the insider trading. That alone is prima
&gt;facie evidence of a direct relationship between the financial markets and
&gt;terrorist investigations.
&gt;
&gt;CIA AND THE MARKETS
&gt;
&gt;We can thank Fox News on Oct. 16 for breaking post 9-11 stories disclosing
&gt;the use of sophisticated PROMIS software by the FBI and the Justice
&gt;Department. A multitude of court records and investigative reports have
&gt;established not only the reality, but the versatility of a program 
&gt;initially
&gt;designed to incorporate data from a variety of data bases in different
&gt;languages into one readable format. PROMIS has since been refined to 
&gt;include
&gt;artificial intelligence and "back doors" inserted by intelligence agencies
&gt;to allow for surreptitious retrieval and/or removal and alteration of data.
&gt;
&gt;The Fox stories clearly confirmed, especially when added to stories from
&gt;last summer by the Washington Times which were based on interviews with
&gt;Justice Department officials, that PROMIS was used to monitor banking and
&gt;financial transactions in a virtual real-time environment.
&gt;
&gt;This writer has written extensively on the software. More information can 
&gt;be
&gt;found on the Web site at
&gt;http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/index.html.
&gt;However, one point is critical to this report. In fall 2000 I was visited 
&gt;in
&gt;Los Angeles by two members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)
&gt;national security staff. They were conducting a major investigation inside
&gt;the U.S. to determine whether or not the RCMP�s version of the software had
&gt;been compromised. During discussions with the Mounties, I confirmed several
&gt;times that the software was used to monitor stock trades in real time. A
&gt;subsequent investigation led me to contact several people in Canada who had
&gt;been interviewed in the same investigation. They were stockbrokers.
&gt;In a taped panel discussion, which aired March 14 on Canada's Vision-TV, I
&gt;faced a panel of three Canadian experts on the issue of U.S. foreknowledge
&gt;of, and possible complicity in, the 9-11 attacks. Among them was Ron Atkey,
&gt;former Canadian solicitor-general and the former parliamentary head of the
&gt;committee charged with oversight of Canada's military and intelligence
&gt;operations. Over the course of the program I made specific statements,
&gt;relying not only on the RCMP interactions but also on previous
&gt;investigations, that it was documented that intelligence services track
&gt;stock trades in real time. On camera, I produced the business cards of the
&gt;two RCMP agents. Atkey, who had not hesitated to challenge me on other
&gt;points during the show, went silent.
&gt;
&gt;INTELLIGENCE SUCESSES
&gt;
&gt;Four basic intelligence successes need to be acknowledged here. These
&gt;admitted successes, while not addressing any other still secret 
&gt;penetrations
&gt;of the Al Qaeda network, further diminish any Bush Administration assertion
&gt;that it did not know of the attacks.
&gt;
&gt;On Feb. 13 United Press International terrorism correspondent Richard Sale,
&gt;while covering a Manhattan trial of one of Osama bin Laden's followers,
&gt;reported the National Security Agency had broken bin Laden�s encrypted
&gt;communications. Even if that prompted an immediate change in bin Laden's
&gt;methods of communication, just six months before the attacks, the
&gt;administration has consistently maintained -- and military and covert
&gt;experience dictates -- that the attacks were planned for at least several
&gt;years.
&gt;
&gt;The FAZ story indicates that the secret eavesdropping program Echelon had
&gt;been successful in securing details of the pending attacks. Echelon employs
&gt;highly sophisticated computer programs capable of both voice and word
&gt;recognition to filter billions of telephone conversations and locate
&gt;specific targets. Assuming, as some sources indicate, Al Qaeda stopped 
&gt;using
&gt;encrypted communications after it was known that their system was
&gt;compromised, why was the NSA not able to pick up any cell phone calls or
&gt;e-mails? Mohammed Atta and other alleged hijackers were known to have used
&gt;cell phones. The FAZ story establishes that as late as June, Al Qaeda
&gt;operatives were being tracked in this manner.
&gt;
&gt;In the trial of a former Deutschebank executive Kevin Ingram, who pled
&gt;guilty to laundering drug money to finance terrorist operations linked to 
&gt;Al
&gt;Qaeda just two weeks before the 9-11 attacks, indications surfaced that the
&gt;Justice Department had penetrated the terrorists� financial network. A Nov.
&gt;16 Associated Press story by Catherine Wilson stated, "Numerous promised
&gt;wire transfers never arrived, but there were discussions of foreign bankers
&gt;taking payoffs to move the money to purchase weapons into the United 
&gt;States,
&gt;said prosecutor Rolando Garcia."
&gt;
&gt;Two questions are begged but unanswered. How were the wire transfers 
&gt;blocked
&gt;and how was the Justice Department able to monitor the money flows without
&gt;alerting either the bankers or the suspects?
&gt;
&gt;Finally, as reported by the German paper Die Welt on Dec. 6 and by Agence
&gt;France Presse on Dec. 7, Western intelligence services, including the CIA,
&gt;learned after arrests in the Philippines, that Al Qaeda operatives had
&gt;planned to crash commercial airliners into the WTC. Details of the plan, as
&gt;reported by a number of American press outlets, were found on a computer
&gt;seized during the arrests. The plan was called "operation Bojinka."
&gt;
&gt;Details of the plot were disclosed publicly in 1997 in the New York trial 
&gt;of
&gt;Ramsi Youssef for his involvement in the 1993 WTC bombing.
&gt;
&gt;DELMART "MIKE" VREELAND
&gt;
&gt;I believe that, from the information I have seen, Mike Vreeland tried to
&gt;pass information to the Canadian government that should have been passed to
&gt;the U.S. government. That information had to do with the attacks of Sept.
&gt;11. Whatever other attempts were made by Vreeland and his attorneys to 
&gt;alert
&gt;U.S. and Canadian officials of the attacks, it is clear that he did pass
&gt;information about the pending attacks to his guards in August. I am willing
&gt;to go to the Secretary of the Navy to determine whether or not he was
&gt;actually a Navy officer. I know that there have been other U.S. citizens
&gt;with a similar background used on missions similar to what has been alleged
&gt;by Vreeland. This man fits a pattern. I would like for the Secret Service 
&gt;to
&gt;put him on a polygraph." -- Mike Osborne, a veteran former CIA case officer
&gt;with 26 years of experience in counter-terrorism.
&gt;
&gt;With a court record now estimated to approach 10,000 pages, the case of
&gt;Delmart "Mike" Vreeland is starting to attract worldwide attention.
&gt;Vreeland, with a growing amount of evidence admitted into court record in
&gt;Toronto, Canada, claims to be a former U.S. Naval lieutenant assigned to 
&gt;the
&gt;Office of Naval Intelligence. He was jailed in Canada -- at the request of
&gt;U.S. authorities -- in December 2000 after returning from Moscow.
&gt;
&gt;Although Canadian authorities initially alleged vague fraud charges against
&gt;him and also held him on an extradition warrant alleging credit card fraud
&gt;in Michigan, the actual motive for his arrest now seems to be something
&gt;quite different. All Canadian charges against Vreeland were dropped this
&gt;March and he has been granted political refugee status in Canada until the
&gt;extradition issues are resolved.
&gt;
&gt;Vreeland's position is he returned from Russia to meet with a Canadian and 
&gt;a
&gt;Russian intelligence operative, and had intended to hand over a sealed 
&gt;pouch
&gt;containing intelligence documents. When the handoff was compromised and the
&gt;Canadian did not show for the Toronto meet, Vreeland opened the pouch and
&gt;looked at some of the documents. Those documents, which he later had
&gt;translated, gave specific warnings of the pending WTC attacks that took
&gt;place nine months later. Again, on its face, since these documents were in 
&gt;a
&gt;sealed intelligence pouch, this indicates intelligence operatives were 
&gt;aware
&gt;of the contents because they had placed them there originally.
&gt;
&gt;According to both Vreeland and his lawyers, as reported in numerous
&gt;interviews with this writer and other members of the FTW staff immediately
&gt;after his arrest, Vreeland began making urgent attempts to alert both
&gt;Canadian and U.S. intelligence officials of the coming danger.
&gt;
&gt;After eight months of unsuccessful attempts to have either Canadian or U.S.
&gt;intelligence services debrief him, Vreeland wrote a desperate, last-ditch
&gt;warning in August. Through means he will not disclose, he acquired two
&gt;high-tech Pilot water-based pens with light blue ink and used them to write
&gt;the letter. The only pens permitted by Canadian jail authorities were
&gt;oil-based, dark blue Bic pens.
&gt;
&gt;Immediately after writing the letter, Vreeland notified his jailers that he
&gt;had pens which might be considered contraband. A Sept. 17 letter from the
&gt;Ministry of Correctional Services was entered as Exhibit "M" into court
&gt;records on Oct. 7, along with Vreeland's warning letter which had been
&gt;opened on Sept. 14 and marked as Exhibit "N." The letter states, "On August
&gt;13, 2001 inmate Vreeland's corridor #2 was searched and as far as we know 2
&gt;blue ink pens were removed from his cell because they were considered
&gt;contraband. There is no written record of them being placed in his personal
&gt;property. He did submit a request to have them returned to him on August 
&gt;14,
&gt;2001, but was denied."
&gt;
&gt;Since the ink on the warning letter, if tested, will match the ink in the
&gt;confiscated pens, there can be no doubt that the letter was written a month
&gt;before the attacks.
&gt;
&gt;In an interview with this writer published on April 4, Vreeland clearly
&gt;stated his belief that Al Qaeda operations had been completely penetrated 
&gt;by
&gt;U.S. intelligence services. That belief is supported by a statement in his
&gt;warning letter.
&gt;
&gt;The statement, following a list of potential targets that included the WTC,
&gt;the Pentagon and the White House said, "Let one happen, stop the rest." 
&gt;Such
&gt;a statement could only imply complete penetration or compromise of the
&gt;terrorist cells perpetrating the attacks.
&gt;
&gt;Compelling evidence continues to grow that Vreeland was, in fact, a U.S.
&gt;Navy officer. On Jan. 10 from open court with a court reporter recording 
&gt;the
&gt;conversation, his attorneys placed a speaker-phone call to the Pentagon. A
&gt;Pentagon operator, after checking a military database, confirmed Vreeland
&gt;was a U.S. Navy officer and provided an office listing and a telephone
&gt;number for his office. In addition, redacted and incomplete military 
&gt;records
&gt;provided by the Pentagon to the Canadian courts indicate Vreeland had a
&gt;service record of more than 1,200 pages.
&gt;
&gt;This is difficult to reconcile with the U.S. Navy's assertion that Vreeland
&gt;was discharged as a seaman recruit after four months of unsatisfactory
&gt;service in 1986.
&gt;
&gt;No press entity has covered the Vreeland case more than FTW. This writer 
&gt;has
&gt;traveled twice to Toronto, sat in on court proceedings, and retained the
&gt;services of a Canadian correspondent to cover the case. I have interviewed
&gt;Vreeland personally and conducted numerous interviews with his attorneys.
&gt;Greta Knutzen, FTW's Canadian correspondent, has also interviewed Vreeland
&gt;and his attorneys, as well as Vreeland's mother. Knutzen has attended every
&gt;court proceeding since January. All of our previous reporting on the case
&gt;can be located on the Internet at http://www.copvcia.com.
&gt;Mike Vreeland believes that if he is successfully extradited to the U.S., 
&gt;he
&gt;will be assassinated. Previous press stories concerning Vreeland's criminal
&gt;past and a criminal arrest record fail to account for the fact that, as an
&gt;undercover operative who targeted organized crime and terrorist
&gt;organizations, a criminal record would have been necessary to give him
&gt;credibility with organizations that previously demonstrated capabilities to
&gt;retrieve law enforcement records. They also fail to account for an Oct. 2,
&gt;1986 Los Angeles Times story that lists Vreeland as a non-criminal witness
&gt;to a major cocaine bust carried out by LAPD investigators known to have
&gt;contacts with USG intelligence services.
&gt;
&gt;There is much about Vreeland's past that is objectionable, questionable, or
&gt;both. But even in a worst-case scenario, nothing in his past explains how 
&gt;he
&gt;was able to write a detailed warning of the attacks before they occurred,
&gt;and why the intelligence services of both Canada and the U.S. ignored
&gt;attempts to warn them while both Vreeland and his attorneys were banging
&gt;down their doors.
&gt;
&gt;CONCLUSION
&gt;
&gt;There is clear and substantial evidence to suggest that the Bush
&gt;Administration had sufficient foreknowledge of the attacks of Sept. 11 to
&gt;have prevented them. Rather than viewing each of the four listed areas as a
&gt;separate piece of evidence, they should be considered as a body, in the
&gt;exact same way exhibits presented to a jury in a criminal trial are viewed
&gt;as a body. By viewing the evidence in this manner, an unavoidable 
&gt;conclusion
&gt;is reached -- the USG knew 25 suicide hijackers during the week of Sept. 9
&gt;were going to use United and American airlines commercial planes, some of
&gt;them likely originating in Boston, to attack the WTC and the Pentagon. A
&gt;multitude of press stories and intelligence reports indicate the WTC would
&gt;have been the primary target.
&gt;
&gt;Given the financial commitments made during insider trading activity that
&gt;occurred immediately before the attacks involving businesses that were
&gt;directly damaged by the attacks, the threats had clearly moved from the
&gt;realm of speculation to reality. Why else would mysterious investors have
&gt;risked millions of dollars to purchase the put options? There is compelling
&gt;evidence to suggest these trades were noted by the CIA and other USG
&gt;entities.
&gt;
&gt;Recently, Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., has been widely criticized in the
&gt;mainstream press for raising the need for a Congressional investigation to
&gt;answer some of these obvious questions. This, in spite of the fact that
&gt;popular reaction indicates a different sentiment. An opinion poll, 
&gt;conducted
&gt;by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution just a day after McKinney's remarks
&gt;received wide public attention in a Washington Post story dated April 12,
&gt;was pulled after poll numbers showed that 51 percent of the respondents
&gt;agreed with McKinney.
&gt;
&gt;The people seem to recognize and agree with the opinion of former CIA
&gt;officer Mike Osborne who says, "I think that the U.S. government needs to
&gt;get behind McKinney's questions because her agenda is truth and justice, 
&gt;and
&gt;nothing else."

May 14,  2002
Colleagus for the Solidarity of Vieques:

The Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques is organizing a 
Campaign: Adopt a Vieques Prisioner of Consciouss.  This Campaign consist 
basically of choosing a civil disobedient prisioner in the recent military 
maneuvers in Vieques.  If everyone adopted a political prisioner to write 
to, any of your colleagus could write and keep them inform of what is 
happening in the outside world.  We are even requesting any economic 
assistance, since they need to buy EVERYTHING thru their store and family 
members are not allowed to bring any objects.  Only money orders are 
accepted and can be mailed to the following addresses;

At this moment there's only 14 civil dfisobedient prisioners in the Federal 
Jail:

June 12th, Tania Hern�ndez Carri�n # 19505-069, will be let out of jail

June 9th, Francisco B�ez # 22128-069 and
H�ctor Qui�ones Concepci�n # 25041-069, will be freed

July 12th, Carlos Zen�n # 23214-069  and

Report from the Federal Jail

Yesterday (Wednesday), Pedro Col�n arrived at our unite 1-A.  He waited 
three months for this transfer for.  Now we only need for them to transfer 
the two Qui�ones brothers from unit 1-C to unit 1-A so that all the Vieques 
prisoners will be together.
Tomorrow (Friday) don Luis Rodriguez from Ponce is leaving us.

We are all in good health and have a good fighting spirit.  This morning 
Taso touched up the paint on the principle door of our unit. That is Taso's 
job.  Cuso (Ivan Elias), Chico (Federico B�ez), Rafy (Rafael Feliciano) and 
I (Bob) cleaned the tables and floor of the lunchroom after breakfast. Our 
assigned job is to clean after every meal.  Hiram Lozada and Oscar Ch�rriez 
work cleaning the hall floors of the building as part of the night brigades 
(9-12 PM). Our unit is the mimium custody work unit.  Prisoners here 
consider themselves �cadre�and have some privileges:
             -generally they do not shut the doors of our cells.
             -we do not have to stand facing the walls of the elevator and 
the passage ways when we are taken to see our visitors, as is the case with 
the prisoners of the other units.
             -we have more telephone hours (up to 11:30pm) and more hours in 
the yard.
             - we use uniforms with pants, belt and a shirt instead of the 
jump suit.


The other prisoners show a lot of solidarity toward the struggle of Vieques 
and toward us as individual human beings. A fellow prisoner gave me some 
pants (my exact size); other gave me some slippers for the shower, another 
prisoner lent me for the 6 months that I will be here a pair of almost new 
NIKE tennis shoes.  Another young Boricua gave me some black work boots that 
I use to "go out" to my social and legal visits; others have brought us 
homemade puddings and cheese.

With the help of the chaplains we are exploring the possibility of 
presenting a concert or a series of musical presentations as an expression 
of gratitude from the Committee for Rescue and Development of Vieques and 
from all the people that struggle for Vieques to the prison population.  The 
prisoners have demonstrated much solidary to the civil disobedients that are 
here now, those who came before and to those that are still to come.  Quique 
Benet y Zoraida are helping us organized this from "the street."

The priest that celebrates Mass in the chapel of our unit every Sunday (I 
went last Sunday) acknowledged our presence and said that every Sunday they 
pray for Peace for Vieques!


Once again we are all well, preparing ourselves to continue the struggle 
when we are freed.  We walk each day, lift weights and do other yard 
exercises. Chico, Iv�n El�as and Rafy are the table tennis champions!

We have received a large quantity of correspondence from family, friends, 
from people in Puerto Rico, from the United States and from other countries 
such as Ireland, Philippines and France expressing messages of support and 
solidarity and giving us photos, books etc.

We are thankful for this opportunity to struggle both from within these 
prison walls and from "the street."

White Supremacist Found Guilty in '63 Bombing of Church

May 22, 2002
By RICK BRAGG 




 

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., May 22 - A jury of nine whites and three
blacks found Bobby Frank Cherry, a 71-year-old white
supremacist, guilty of murder today in the 1963 church
bombing that killed four black girls. 

Mr. Cherry faces an automatic sentence of life in prison.


It took the jury less than a day of deliberations to return
the verdict against Mr. Cherry, who was the last of four
primary suspects who prosecutors said planned or planted
the bomb that killed Denise McNair, Addie Mae Collins,
Cynthia Wesley and Carole Robertson. 

When the bomb exploded under stairs outside the 16th Street
Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963, just days after the
court-ordered desegregation of Birmingham's schools,
investigators focused on Mr. Cherry, Robert Chambliss,
Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Herman Frank Cash. 

In closing arguments on Tuesday, Mr. Cherry's defense
lawyer, Mickey Johnson, told jurors that for almost 40
years authorities never looked at anyone else, even though
investigators could have "just thrown a net" and captured
many men who had the same views and the same level of
involvement as Mr. Cherry. 

"Surely," the lawyer said, "you are not going to let the
state convict on guilt by association." He said it was
disingenuous for the same state government that had once
supported the racist views of so many of its citizens to
now "come here with this feel-good prosecution." Instead of
proving that his client was a bomber, he said, the state
had merely proved that he was a lot like everybody else. 

In the late 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Cherry, who became a
demolitions expert while in the Marines, become one of a
small, hard core of violent supremacists, prosecutors said.
In 1957, as the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth tried to integrate
a Birmingham school, Mr. Cherry joined a mob that attacked
him on the street. Mr. Cherry used a set of brass knuckles
to punch him in the head, prosecutors said. In 1961, they
said, he used a pistol to bash the head of a black man who
insulted him at a Birmingham restaurant. 

He boasted of those things as an old man, even to the
F.B.I. "Bopped ol' Shuttlesworth in the head," he said to
investigators. "Split a nigger's head open," he said
another time. The statute of limitations on those crimes
has long run out. 

In 1963, just days after traditionally white Birmingham
schools were finally opened to black students, he began to
plot the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church,
prosecutors said. "My children will never go to school with
niggers," Mr. Cherry once said. 

Mr. Johnson said the state had produced no hard evidence
linking Mr. Cherry to the bombing, only to the past. 

But prosecutors refuted that. They tied him to the bombing
through his own words, in which Mr. Cherry bragged to
family members and others, over the years. 

They linked him to the Modern Sign Company, where he met
with Mr. Chambliss and Mr. Blanton on the Friday before the
bombing. Investigators believe the bomb may have been
assembled there. 

In a June 28, 1964, F.B.I. tape of a conversation between
Mr. Blanton and his wife, Jean, he told her that "we were
making the bomb" at the sign company, just three blocks
from the church, that Friday. 

In an Oct. 9, 1963, statement to the F.B.I., signed by Mr.
Cherry, he wrote that he was at the Modern Sign shop that
night from about 5:30 until after midnight with Mr. Blanton
and Mr. Chambliss. 

Mr. Chambliss, who was known in Birmingham as Dynamite Bob
because of his involvement in so many bombings, was
convicted in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in
1977, and died in prison. 

Mr. Blanton was convicted in the bombing last year. Mr.
Cash died untried. 

Prosecutors also attacked Mr. Cherry's alibis. During a
1997 interview with investigators, Mr. Cherry said he was
at home the Saturday night the bomb was believed to have
been planted at the church. He said he was watching
wrestling on television and looking after his wife,
Virginia, who was sick with cancer. There was no wrestling
on Birmingham's television stations that night, and his
wife's cancer was not diagnosed until 1965.

Cool It!

May 22, 2002
By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 




 

Ah, excuse me, but could we all just calm down here? 

What started as a story about how the Bush team handled
unspecific warnings about possible terrorist attacks in the
U.S. before 9/11 has now prompted the Bushies not only to
defend themselves from charges of irresponsibility - which
they are entitled to do - but to go on a Chicken Little
warnings binge that another attack is imminent, inevitable
and around the corner, but we can't tell you when, where or
how. 

Look, in the wake of 9/11, I would never rule out any kind
of attack. That would be foolhardy. But I'm no more
interested in indicting the Bush team for failing to
respond to an unspecific warning about a possible terrorist
attack before 9/11 than I'm interested in having the vice
president and F.B.I. director warn us about the certainty
of an unspecified attack sometime in the future. 

What are we supposed to do with this information? Never go
into another apartment building, because reports suggest an
Al Qaeda cell may rent an apartment just to blow up the
whole structure? Don't go outside? Don't go near national
monuments? Pat the belly of every pregnant woman to check
if she's a suicide bomber? 

Who wants to live that way? Let's make a deal: We won't
criticize the administration for not anticipating 9/11 if
it won't terrorize the country by now predicting every
possible nightmare scenario, but no specific ones,
post-9/11. Not only are these "warnings" just unnerving the
public when people were finally starting to calm down, but
they are also obscuring something very important: We are
winning this war. 

No, it's not over. And yes, I too will say for the record
that sometime, somewhere, there will be another attack. But
in the meantime we've actually accomplished a lot. If Osama
bin Laden is alive, a big if, his ability to direct acts of
terrorism against U.S. targets has been disrupted. It is
doubtful that he would dare even use a telephone. 

That is important, because bin Laden and his top deputies
were a unique and very smart, creative and daring group of
terrorists, who do not come along every day. And whether
they are all dead or deep in hiding, there is no indication
they are in business right now. Yes, probably less
professional cells still exist and can still wreak havoc.
But when you decapitate an organization like Al Qaeda, and
disrupt its money flow, you've done a lot. And when you
oust the Taliban in Afghanistan and take away the one true
safe harbor for bin Laden - for training and operations -
you've also done a lot. 

We have put in place reasonable precautions at airports; we
have instituted better coordination between the F.B.I.,
C.I.A. and I.N.S.; we are tracking foreign students more
closely; and we and our allies have detained thousands of
suspects. The fact that there has been no other major
incident since 9/11 is surely not because the terrorists
have abandoned their intentions. It is because we have
hampered their capabilities. That is a good thing. 

But the very nature of this war against small groups and
individuals bent on terrorism is that you can never win it
definitively. It will be with us forever. But we can limit
the number of attacks - and keep terrorist cells on the run
and disrupted enough to reduce their capabilities - if our
public officials responsible for this war are not spending
all day looking in their rear-view mirrors or mindlessly
terrorizing the public with unspecified, cover-your-behind
warnings about future terrorism. 

This is absolutely not an argument for a free pass for the
Bush team. Given the stories about intelligence failures
that have come out already, we clearly need a special
commission, led by professionals, not politicians, that
looks into the decadelong history of our handling of Al
Qaeda and explores why we did not have better intelligence,
why the dots were not connected and how to improve in the
future. 

But the other thing we need to do is grow up. If we're
going to maintain an open society, all we can do is take
all reasonable precautions and then suck it up and learn to
live with a higher level of risk. That is our fate, so
let's not drive ourselves crazy. 

I don't know about you, but my Memorial Day weekend plans
are set: golf Saturday, bike trip Sunday, barbecue Monday.
If the F.B.I. director wants to interrupt my weekend with a
specific warning, I'll be all ears; otherwise, pipe down
and chill out. Remember it's supposed to be Al Qaeda that's
running scared, not us.

People's Campaign endorses candidates for mayor, council
Published in the Home News Tribune 5/23/02

By SHARON WATERS
STAFF WRITER

NEW BRUNSWICK: The People's Campaign endorsed James Neal for mayor and 
nominated two City Council candidates Tuesday night.

In their first runs for office, Joe Smith of May Street and Danny Rosado of 
Wright Place are challenging incumbents Joseph V. Egan and Blanquita 
Valenti. Neal, a police officer running for mayor a fifth time, is opposing 
Mayor Jim Cahill.

Smith, 25, said he works at Home Depot in Bloomfield and is on a leave of 
absence from Rutgers University, where he is studying political science and 
history.

Rosado, 45, said she works at Wal-Mart in North Brunswick and has three 
children, ages 9, 11 and 20. Rosado immigrated from the Dominican Republic, 
where she was an aviation mechanic. She has lived in New Brunswick for 13 
years.

The People's Campaign, with the slogan "Unite the many; defeat the few," 
supports an elected Board of Education and community control over housing, 
employment and the police, said Smith.

The People's Campaign was created in 2000, Smith said. About 25 to 30 people 
voted for the candidates at a meeting Tuesday night at the library, he said.

Cliff Smith, Joe's brother, will serve as campaign manager.

Sailors Sprayed With Nerve Gas in Cold War Test, Pentagon Says

May 24, 2002
By THOM SHANKER with WILLIAM J. BROAD 




 

WASHINGTON, May 23 - The Defense Department sprayed live
nerve and biological agents on ships and sailors in cold
war-era experiments to test the Navy's vulnerability to
toxic warfare, the Pentagon revealed today. 

The Pentagon documents made public today showed that six
tests were carried out in the Pacific Ocean from 1964 to
1968. In the experiments, nerve or chemical agents were
sprayed on a variety of ships and their crews to gauge how
quickly the poisons could be detected and how rapidly they
would disperse, as well as to test the effectiveness of
protective gear and decontamination procedures in use at
the time. 

Hundreds of sailors exposed to the poisons in tests
conducted in the 1960's could be eligible for health care
benefits, and the Department of Veterans Affairs has
already begun contacting those who participated in some of
the experiments, known as Project Shipboard Hazard and
Defense, or SHAD. 

"We are committed to helping every veteran who took part in
these tests," said Anthony J. Principi, the secretary of
veterans affairs. "If we find any medical problems or
disabilities we can attribute to Project SHAD, we'll ensure
these veterans receive the benefits they deserve." 

Of the six tests, three used sarin, a nerve agent, or VX, a
nerve gas; one used staphylococcal enterotoxin B, known as
SEB, a biological toxin; one used a simulant believed to be
harmless but subsequently found to be dangerous; and one
used a nonpoisonous simulant. 

Michael Kilpatrick, a medical official in the office of the
assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said it
was unclear whether sailors had been intentionally exposed
to the germ and chemical agents without the benefit of
protective masks and gear. Also uncertain, he said, was
whether any had given their permission to become human
guinea pigs in medical experiments with the deadly
substances. 

"When you read the overarching plans for the testing,
people were to be protected," he said in an interview. "But
when we get to individual reports, we do not see things
like informed consent or individual protection. We don't
have the records for what, if any, protection was given to
people." 

The implication, he said, is that in some cases sailors may
have been exposed to the chemical and germ dangers. 

"To me," Dr. Kilpatrick added, "the important thing now is
that the Defense Department and veterans affairs are
cooperating for the benefit of the veteran." 

The Department of Veterans Affairs has notified 622 of
about 4,300 military personnel, mostly from the Navy,
identified as participants in Project SHAD. The process of
identifying the veterans who participated in the program
began in September 2000 under pressure from Representative
Mike Thompson, Democrat of California, who was responding
to claims by veterans that they had suffered health damage
from the tests. 

"This information is significant since we now know that our
military personnel were exposed to sarin gas and VX nerve
agent, which are both highly lethal, and other agents that
are known carcinogens," Mr. Thompson said. 

While noting that the documents made public today by the
Pentagon were the third installment of fact sheets on
Project SHAD, bringing to 12 the number of tests that had
been declassified, he demanded that the Defense Department
release additional information on the 113 secret SHAD tests
believed to have been planned. 

"It is only fair to inform service members, some of whom
may not even know of their exposure, of the specific
harmful agents used in SHAD tests," Mr. Thompson said. 

Leonard A. Cole, an expert on biological weapons at Rutgers
University who wrote "Clouds of Secrecy," a book on the
government's germ testing program, said the new disclosures
were troubling but grimly logical. 

"They're important because they add to a whole pool of
knowledge about what the military was doing," he said. "But
they don't shock me. We've known that the Army had exposed
human subjects to biological agents," though always with
permission. 

"If there was no informed consent," Dr. Cole added, "that
would be a big deal. I know of no large-scale testing on
human subjects with chemical or biological weapons that was
performed without some level of informed consent." 

A number of the SHAD tests used harmless simulants that
were meant to mimic and trace the dissemination of real
agents. But others used deadly chemicals and germs. 

One test, named "Fearless Johnny," was carried out
southwest of Honolulu during August and September of 1965.
The George Eastman, a Navy cargo ship, was sprayed with VX
nerve agent and a simulant to "evaluate the magnitude of
exterior and interior contamination levels" under various
conditions of readiness, as well as study "the shipboard
wash-down system," according to the new documents. 

VX gas, like all nerve agents, penetrates the skin or lungs
to disrupt the body's nervous system and stop breathing. In
small quantities, exposure causes death. 

A 1964 test named Flower Drum Phase I, conducted off the
coast of Hawaii, sprayed sarin and a chemical simulant onto
the same ship and into its ventilation system while the
crew wore various levels of protective gear. In phase 2 of
the test, VX gas was sprayed onto a barge to examine the
ship's water wash-down system and other decontamination
measures, according to the documents. 

Another experiment, Deseret Test Center Test 68-50, was
intended to determine the casualty levels from an F-4
Phantom jet spraying SEB, a crippling germ toxin. The test
was done in the Marshall Islands in September and October
of 1968. The jet sprayed the deadly mist over part of
Eniwetok Atoll and five Army light tugs, the documents
said. 

SEB, a report added, "is not generally thought of as a
lethal agent" but instead as an incapacitating agent that
can knock out people for one or two weeks with fever,
chills, headache and coughing. The SEB came from a bacteria
that causes a common type of food poisoning. 

Deseret Test Center Test 69-32, done southwest of Hawaii
from April to June 1969, used two germs that were thought
to be harmless, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli,
the germ of the human gut. But Serratia marcescens in time
turned out to be dangerous. 

"It is an opportunistic pathogen," the report said today,
"causing infections of the endocardium, blood, wounds, and
urinary and respiratory tracts." 

The documents said the Pacific test of the two germs, which
were meant to simulate dangerous biological agents, was
meant to see how sunlight influenced their survival. A
military aircraft sprayed the germs on five tugs, "each
converted to serve as an oceangoing sampling platform and
laboratory," the documents said.

ok guillo &amp; all, according to this guideline here is my "complete political
platform": All positive criticism encouraged!
(i will comment beneath each topic guillo listed below)


Abortion-
������ i actively support womens' right to safe &amp; legal abortion. further, i
recognize the need for a public women's resource center in NB for community 
&amp;
rutger's women. this center should deal with issues such as but not limited 
to
abortion, domestic violence, child birth, child care, history &amp; present info 
of
women's struggle such as voting rights &amp; equal pay for equal work.
i support planned parenthood &amp; have been active in clinic defense for 
patients
around NJ.

my oppent Joe Egan is anti abortion - which no male who supports democracy 
can
be!

Capitol Punishment - (which i understand to be the death penalty)
������ i do not support capitol punishment, especially under the Bush2
Administration. my aunt is a lawyer out of chicago that only works death row
cases &amp; we keep in touch about the task of gaining public support to 
pressure
legislation to end capital punishment. i have been active in coalition 
efforts
with state-wide organizations which demand an end to the death penalty.

Drugs -
������ i support an end to prohibition of drugs. prohibition is not ending 
drug
use &amp; prohibition is not saving lives. prohibition is misusing billions of 
our
tax dollars nationally &amp; criminalizing hundreds of thousands non-violent
peoples, especially poor peoples of black &amp; latino nationality. the social
effects of prohibition are not productive, unless your objective is to stuff
prisons beyond the max.� i understand that an end to prohibition would
drastically reduce crime &amp; gang development.

Gay/Lesbian Rights -
������ i support &amp; defend gay/lesbian right to a safe &amp; healthy environment 
in
the nb/rutgers work &amp; neighborhood community.

Gun Control -
������ i support &amp; defend the right to bear arms for the people of america.

Immigration (Minority Rights/Schooling) -
������ i support &amp; defend those that have immigrated to america. further, 
all residents
that contribute to the tax base of this nation &amp; cities must have voting 
rights,
affordable housing, the right to a living wage, equal access to quality
education, healthcare, childcare, &amp; the right to practice their culture 
without
threat.

Internet Censorship -
������� i support &amp; defend the censorship of white &amp; male supremacy along 
w/nazi
promotions. these peoples, groups, &amp; paraphanaliea attack the rights of all 
the
peoples to have &amp; maintain healthy families, culture, &amp; communties.

Space Program -
������� though i am not well studied on US space initiatives, i do know that 
we
need resources on earth to develop the peoples. i would suggest that the 
people
of the US, after being educated, should be voting on what to do with these
resources. star wars must be scrapped as well as all arms race.

Social Security -
�������� i support &amp; defend social security to provide for working people 
upon
retirement. Bush2 must be stopped from tapping into our money's &amp; his 
initiative
to do away w/social security only to be replaced w/risky stock or bond
investments. i would suggest that working peoples are not interested in 
gambling
their retirement funds in a wall street that has proven an unstable &amp; unsafe
environment for our retirement funds. if the SS system is to change it 
should be
done, after education,� by a national mandatory vote of working people.

State's Rights
          i support &amp; defend the federal government to enforce human rights 
throughout
america.


Taxes
�������� what taxes are spent on must be decided by the people that pay 
them!
thus, democracy.
priorities of what taxes are to cover must be mandated by those taxed. 
corporate
taxes should be as high as possible to lessen the burden of working folks.

Thanks for the Heads-Up

May 25, 2002
By FRANK RICH 




 

Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ridge, Mueller. Is there anyone who has
not warned us of Armageddon over the past week? As far as I
can tell, the only slacker in this White House game of Wag
the Dog is Spot. 

You don't have to be a cynic to believe that the point of
the warnings is not to save lives so much as political
hides. After all, we can't go about our daily business much
differently just because of these dire pronouncements. Nor
have they budged the Homeland Security Office's color-coded
"threat level" from its weaselly yellow. What this
orchestrated chorus of Cassandras can do is guarantee that
we duly credit the Bush administration for giving us a
heads-up should disaster strike between now and Election
Day 2004. Not so incidentally, the new warnings also help
facilitate our amnesia about the fracas over how low a
priority Al Qaeda was for the White House before Sept. 11. 

To see how low, there's no need to learn what was in that
top-secret briefing that the president received as he
settled down for his monthlong vacation at his Texas ranch
on Aug. 6. Reports at the time show that Mr. Bush broke off
from work early and spent most of that day fishing. If he
had received foreknowledge of an attack that morning, he
would have acted upon it, and no Democratic leader has said
otherwise (despite Dick Cheney's smears to the contrary). 

But that's not the end of the story. A far more revealing
indication of the administration's ma�ana mindset about
terrorism comes a month later, on Sept. 9, when Donald
Rumsfeld threatened a presidential veto if Congress moved
$600 million out of the White House's prized ballistic
missile defense system and into counterterrorism. On Sept.
10, John Ashcroft submitted a final Justice Department
budget request calling for increases in 68 programs, none
of them directly related to combating terrorism. 

In this somnolent walkup to Sept. 11, the Bush
administration was hardly alone. The terrorism alarm went
off loudly in the United States nine years ago - on Feb.
26, 1993, the first attack on the World Trade Center. The
Clinton administration, Congress, the press and every
government agency entrusted with our security can share
responsibility for the subsequent on-again-off-again focus
on a network of imaginative killers whose leader, motives,
ambitions, potential targets and, as Condoleezza Rice might
say, non-traditional hijacking schemes have long been a
matter of fact and theory on the public record. 

That's history, and no amount of spin from either Bush or
Clinton apologists is going to rewrite it. That's also why
the question of what the president knew about terrorism on
Sept. 11, though important, is hardly the most pressing
now, Washington hysteria notwithstanding. Nearly nine
months have passed since the day that was supposed to
change everything, and Osama bin Laden and most of his top
associates, Mullah Omar included, have not been found, dead
or alive. The most important question is not how ready we
were to fight terrorism on Sept. 11, 2001, but how ready we
are to do so as of Memorial Day weekend 2002. 

Even the administration's own answers are not reassuring.
Asked by Tim Russert last Sunday if the kind of noise that
our intelligence is picking up from Al Qaeda this spring is
"similar" to the noise prior to Sept. 11, Vice President
Cheney answered, "Sure." If that's the case, it's clear
that Ari Fleischer's reassurance to the press in February
that Al Qaeda has been "severely disrupted and severely
hampered" is now inoperative. Further evidence comes from
French and German investigators pursuing the car bombings
that killed 31 in Tunisia and Pakistan this month and last.
One French official told The Times last week that Al Qaeda,
now regrouping in the western provinces of our new ally,
Pakistan, has sent "a warning for the West - you have not
won the war, we are in a position to fight, when we want,
where we want." 

We are the richest, most can-do country in the world, but
at home we're pursuing the war on terrorism with a
management style that's pure Kmart. Back in October Mr.
Bush declared that his new director of homeland security,
Tom Ridge, in charge of coordinating some 70 federal
agencies and countless local ones, would "have the full
attention and complete support of the very highest levels
of our government." Nine months later, Mr. Ridge has
neither. What he does have is a new, less-than-high-tech
headquarters, with an aboveground Washington address that
can be taken out simultaneously with the White House. 

The nation's nuclear plants are vulnerable from the air.
Its borders are porous to malevolent visitors and mat�riel
(only 2 percent of incoming ship cargo is inspected). The
anthrax manhunt is stalled and there has been scant
progress in the supposed push to bring local hospitals up
to speed in identifying and countering bioterrorism. The
I.N.S.'s failure to coordinate with the Social Security
Administration, The Times' Robert Pear reports, is still
allowing tens of thousands of foreigners to secure illegal
Social Security numbers and concoct the fake identities
that proved so useful to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers. 

Remember Argenbright, the rent-a-guard company that was
found to have employed convicts and illegal aliens to
enforce airport security? It's still manning the fort in
five major airports, from Orlando to O'Hare, where it no
doubt continues to do a crack job of strip-searching little
old ladies. This week USA Today reported that the new
Transportation Security Administration has failed to fix
the known security flaws that could allow the easy planting
of bombs in the virtually unscreened cargo on passenger
jets; the paper also found evidence that the same agency is
cutting back on marksmanship training for the federal air
marshals it is hiring to do the shooting it prohibits for
pilots. As for the airport bomb-detecting machines mandated
by Congress, The Wall Street Journal finds 190 in place,
with a mere 1,100 still to go. 

No classified documents are required to connect these dots.
The administration is so fearful that someone will do so
that it impugns the patriotism of those who try. No wonder
Mr. Bush is fighting Democrats and Republicans alike - an
ideological spectrum running from Tom Daschle to William
Kristol - who call for an independent commission to
investigate what went wrong in both his White House and
Bill Clinton's before Sept. 11. The administration knows
that inevitably such a commission, proposed in December by
John McCain and Joe Lieberman, will provide a road map to
what has not been fixed in the nine months since. As a
decoy, Mr. Cheney is instead boasting of administration
support for a Congressional investigation that has already
been hobbled and delayed by political squabbling, false
starts and Justice Department and C.I.A. lollygagging. That
Congressional investigation, run by intelligence oversight
committees that are themselves part of the pre-Sept. 11
failure, promises to be as effective as Congress's pursuit
of Whitewater. 

But as we need some version of a Warren Commission to get
to the bottom of what went wrong, so we need an inverted
Manhattan Project (one that will stop a bomb rather than
build one) to recruit America's best minds to set things
right. Mr. Ridge, a decent politician with no expertise in
intelligence or counterterrorism, is a frivolous choice for
security czar. Mr. Ashcroft, an aspiring J. Edgar Hoover
isolated from reality by a circle of cronies, lacks the
intellect and leadership ability to take on an adversary as
cunning as Osama bin Laden. What he cares about most is
maximizing his own power, and not just over civil
liberties. His Justice Department has joined in the effort
to block Mr. Ridge from consolidating the four overlapping
agencies in charge of watching American borders. Now we
learn, with the news of his suppression of the F.B.I.
Phoenix memo, that Mr. Ashcroft will even cut the president
out of the loop of law-enforcement embarrassments occurring
on his watch. 

�� 
With all the talent in this country and all that's at
stake, is this the best we can muster? Addressing a meeting
of emergency workers from around the country in New York
this week, Thomas Von Essen, the fire commissioner of Sept.
11, said that politicians were "not making the tough
decisions" and feared that "we will be standing here crying
over police officers and firefighters and civilians next
year, this year maybe." His views were echoed by Richard
Sheirer, the Giuliani director of emergency management: "We
can't let complacency set in, and I think it has already."
Given that the history of Al Qaeda tells us that its major
attacks are separated by intervals of 12 to 24 months,
we'll find out soon enough.

&gt;
&gt;     WE WROTE SOMETIME AGO ABOUT RAS BARAKA'S CANDIDACY IN THE NEWARK
&gt;Municipal elections held May 14, 2002. Ras finished high enough in the
&gt;election to qualify for the June 11, 2002 Run -Off Election.
&gt;     We are happy about this, but in the pre election polls Ras finished
&gt;higher than all the at large candidates. It was only the huge amounts of
&gt;money and patronage produced "volunteers" that prevented him from finishing
&gt;ahead of all the candidates.
&gt;     For the Run-Off elections we must raise $20,000 just to cover workers,
&gt;literature, cars, sound, food, just for election day. With your support Ras
&gt;can win and provide a signal that in these grim times marred by a 
&gt;Counterfeit
&gt;President and a Fake Democracy, we can begin to turn the trend around.

FAX USP ATLANTA AND DEMAND THAT JOSE SOLIS JORDAN BE MOVED TO MDC GUAYNABO, 
PUERTO RICO WHERE HE IS SUPPOSED TO FINISH OFF THE REST OF HIS SENTENCE AND 
THAT HE BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIS FAMILY AND ATTORNEY!!

The Saga Continues With Doctor Solis Jordan
Hermes Ayala, Redactor, El Vocero

Marta Gonzalez, the wife of Jose Solis Jordan, has not heard or known 
anything about her husband for exactly one week.  Yesterday she had to 
settle for leaving a recorded message at the federal jail in Atlanta.  
Yesterday, Gonzalez spoke with the penitentiary where an official confirmed 
that her husband was there and after que questioned why the lack of 
communication with her husband, he referred her to another extension where 
she was only able to leave another recorded message.

"The only thing I have been able to do is to call Atlanta and leave a 
message relating my concern", Gonzalez indicated.

Her husband who is serving 51 months seditious conspiracy, was supposed to 
arrive in Puerto Rico last Tuesday, May 21, 2002, to finish his sentence at 
the federal prison in Guaynabo and later at a half-way house where he would 
stay while working during the day on his way to adjusting agains to society. 
On November 22, 2002 his sentence would be completed.

However, Solis Jordan continues enroute and his wife and familyl do not know 
what else to do or believe.

"They assured me that he was in Atlanta, but until I can speak with him ... 
after all that has happended, you never know what could happen. You don't 
want to exaggerate or be pessimistic ... I have a lot of faith but the truth 
is that this federal government has been very unjust.  It is they themselves 
that are creating the doubts and worries. What won't they let him call me?", 
indicated Gonzalez.

Gonzalez indicated that when she spoke with Atlanta she left the numbers of 
her home and her cell phone, but until this time neither phone has rung with 
any good news.

The lawyer in the case, Linda Backiel, has also tried to communicate with 
her client but her efforts have failed. "She doesn't know anything either, 
but the level of isolation they have him in seems to be total", was stated 
by Solis Jordan's wife. She has no choice but to wait and with each passing 
day, the time seems even longer and longer.

"Concern and worry of the family continues. I just want him to be able to 
call, because I don't even know if he has access to his personal things." 
Marta Gonzalez said and she was notable distressed.

&gt;
&gt;Joe,
&gt;
&gt;under the CEP initiative, the 13 months would be replaced with six
&gt;years.  Municipalities have no power to enlarge or shorten civil
&gt;statutes of limitation.  That is set by the State and by the State
&gt;alone.
&gt;
&gt;The number of signatures required on the initiative is 15 percent of
&gt;2001 turnout, a number I don't have off the top of my head, but which
&gt;I guess would be about 5,000 (hence 750 signatures).
&gt;
&gt;My recommendation is that all tenants who think they have claims
&gt;against their landlord consult with a counsel of their own choosing
&gt;to determine their rights and responsibilities, even before cashing
&gt;reimbursement checks from their landlords.  I note that to my
&gt;understanding of the litigation against Ms. Samuelson, the claims
&gt;against her did not include a claim under NJSA 56:8-19.  That
&gt;omission alone is reason enough for tenants to consult with counsel
&gt;before resolving these kinds of disputes.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; &gt;

Subject:S/L editorializes against lawless city officials<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The Star-Ledger editorialized against the lawless New Brunswick 
landlord-officials today. The "nest of snakes" line is particularly 
apropos. 

Commentary

More protection for tenants 

Friday, May 31, 2002

It is a scandal within a scandal. In New Brunswick, the city's rent 
control laws were being routinely violated. And the mayor, along with 
other officials who should have been protecting tenants, were among 
the landlords who illegally raised rents. 

The involvement of city officials makes this episode particularly 
odious. You can argue about the merits of rent control. But when the 
law is in place, it ought to be obeyed. That didn't happen in New 
Brunswick. 

The Community Empowerment Project, a group of Rutgers University 
graduates, found a nest of snakes when it started poking into the 
city's rental housing situation. Mayor James Cahill has admitted 
being part owner of a firm that enacted $33,000 in illegal rent 
increases over the past several years. A councilman, a housing 
inspector and city planner also are among the violators. 

New Brunswick's laws limit some rent increases. But there are ways 
for landlords to maneuver around that. If a tenant moves out 
voluntarily and if the landlord files certain forms and submits to an 
inspection, the rent can rise as high as the market will bear. And 
the Community Empowerment Project found landlords were refusing to 
renew leases, driving out old tenants and otherwise taking advantage 
of low-income renters and students who were not aware of their 
rights. 

The group suggests a sensible reform. It would require landlords to 
give new tenants a plain-language version of all pertinent state and 
local housing laws, not in the small print of the lease but as a 
separate document whenever a rental unit changes hands. That would 
make sense as a state law. There is no reason to pretend that New 
Brunswick is the only place where tenants do not get the full benefit 
of the rent rules, inspection requirements and other laws designed to 
protect them. 

Cahill and the others say they were not involved in the day-to- day 
monitoring of the properties they owned. It's not much of an excuse. 
And they also let cobwebs grow on the city board that is supposed to 
enforce the rent laws. The rent leveling board, which is supposed to 
meet each month, has met once in the last five years. City officials 
say the board was not obligated to meet if it did not have anything 
to do. But obviously there was plenty for it to do. 

Many of the renters who overpaid may not be able to recover the money 
they deserve. The New Brunswick rent control ordinance puts a 13-
month statute of limitations on rent violations. State law gives a 
tenant six years to take legal action against a landlord, so that 
issue will have to be settled in court. 

The more important task is to prevent this from happening in the 
future. Informing tenants of their rights seems a sensible place to 
start.

&gt;CAMPAIGN 2002
&gt;A Man of the '60s for the 21st Century
&gt;Governor's race: Green Party candidate Peter Camejo won't win, but
&gt;he wants to make waves.
&gt;
&gt;By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;He's a financier who wants to become governor, thinks Californians
&gt;are overtaxed and says he is disgusted that Gray Davis failed to
&gt;follow basic business principles during the energy crisis.
&gt;
&gt;The candidate is not Republican Bill Simon Jr., but the Green Party's
&gt;nominee for governor, Peter Miguel Camejo. He is probably the only
&gt;person on the ballot in November who has sailed in the Olympics, been
&gt;expelled from Berkeley, run for president as a Socialist and founded
&gt;his own money management firm.
&gt;
&gt;Camejo, 62, travels in a 10-year-old Infiniti convertible plastered
&gt;with "Ralph Nader for President" bumper stickers, touting his new
&gt;book on socially responsible investing (with introductions written by
&gt;both Nader and a former Reagan administration official) and taking
&gt;potshots at the political establishment. On an Oracle official's
&gt;handing a $25,000 campaign contribution to Davis' director of e-
&gt;government in a bar: "If he's going to engage in corruption, he
&gt;should at least do it right. It should be in unmarked bills."
&gt;
&gt;On the prevalence of religion in politics: "If it was really true
&gt;that people turn over in their graves, Thomas Jefferson and George
&gt;Washington would be sources of perpetual energy."
&gt;
&gt;Camejo says he is under no illusions that he will become California's
&gt;next governor--"my wife would kill me"--but relishes the threat his
&gt;candidacy could pose to Davis by peeling off liberal voters. And he
&gt;says he is unconcerned about the possibility that, if the race
&gt;tightens, he could tip the election to the conservative underdog
&gt;Simon, far further from Camejo ideologically than Davis.
&gt;
&gt;"You can't solve problems gradually and peacefully," Camejo
&gt;said. "You have to make it an explosion."
&gt;
&gt;Democrats say they're not worried. "Since most voters don't take them
&gt;seriously, we don't," state party strategist Bob Mulholland said of
&gt;the Greens. He noted that after 10 years as an official party, Greens
&gt;compose a little less than 1% of California's registered
&gt;voters. "There's no more solid evidence of their inability to get any
&gt;base in the state of California."
&gt;
&gt;The 146,251 registered California Greens lag far behind the state's
&gt;5.3 million registered Republicans and 6.8 million Democrats. The
&gt;Greens racked up nearly 40,000 new California members in 2000 during
&gt;Nader's presidential run but barely added any voters in the last
&gt;year, according to state statistics.
&gt;
&gt;In most California elections, 4% to 5% of the voters abandon the two
&gt;major parties to back other candidates, but no single party has been
&gt;able to consolidate that wayward segment of the electorate. Nader
&gt;pulled 3.8% of California voters during the 2000 presidential
&gt;election, but analysts attribute that relatively robust showing
&gt;partly to his celebrity.
&gt;
&gt;That means that the only effect Camejo is likely to have on the
&gt;governor's race is to take votes from Davis in a tight contest, a
&gt;scenario that clearly pleases the Simon campaign. The other third-
&gt;party candidates--on the American Independent, Libertarian and
&gt;Natural Law tickets--can also only hope to peel a relatively few
&gt;votes from the two main parties.
&gt;
&gt;Bruce Cain, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, said it's too early
&gt;to tell whether Camejo will be a spoiler. "There will be leftists who
&gt;will take a look at the Greens," Cain said. "It would certainly be a
&gt;help to the Democrats if the guy was a total kook."
&gt;
&gt;Business and Leftist Politics
&gt;
&gt;After 45 minutes of speaking to six UC Santa Cruz students recently
&gt;about the need to legalize gay marriage, ban the death penalty,
&gt;implement a $10.50 statewide minimum wage and save California's
&gt;remaining old-growth forests, Camejo scrunched into a supporter's
&gt;hybrid gas-electric car and grabbed his cellular phone.
&gt;
&gt;"Tell me what happened at the close?" he asked after exchanging
&gt;pleasantries with the caller, a hedge fund manager. "What are the
&gt;futures doing now? Did they continue down at the close?"
&gt;
&gt;The Camejo campaign is full of such intersections of 21st century
&gt;capitalism and 1960s radicalism. He laces his talks with standard
&gt;leftist applause lines--condemning U.S. aggression during the war on
&gt;terrorism, or talking about how corporations need to be reined in.
&gt;
&gt;But moments later, he gleefully rattles off terms like "Triple-A Muni
&gt;at 10%" while excitedly talking about a new business venture to
&gt;structure loans to help homeowners install solar energy. He argues
&gt;that California's taxes are too high and that money is wasted on
&gt;giveaways to both corporations and public sector unions.
&gt;
&gt;On the stump, Camejo takes on the demeanor of an irascible college
&gt;lecturer who has always harbored dreams of becoming a stand-up comic.
&gt;In a jacket and slacks with a crown of wiry hair, he skips from one
&gt;point to another, hands bouncing, frequently interrupting himself to
&gt;make some acidic wisecrack or fulminate about the world's injustices.
&gt;
&gt;One staple is for him to brandish a paper graph of the price of
&gt;natural gas in California over the last several years. During a
&gt;renewable-energy forum at a library outside Santa Cruz, Camejo traced
&gt;the prices as he asked when Davis chose to ink $43 billion in energy
&gt;contracts.
&gt;
&gt;"Here?" His finger moved up the curve. "Here? No, here!" He pointed
&gt;at the peak. "I can see any time now, they'll announce the worst
&gt;trade in the history of humanity," Camejo fumed. "This is three
&gt;standard deviations off a trend line!"
&gt;
&gt;Camejo's blend of business sense and left-wing politics brings him
&gt;full circle. He was born in New York to one of Venezuela's wealthiest
&gt;families; his father, Daniel Camejo, is a prosperous resort developer.
&gt;
&gt;It was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
&gt;enrolled in 1958, that Peter Camejo caught the activism bug. He
&gt;dropped out to march for civil rights with Martin Luther King Jr.
&gt;and, later, to organize against the Vietnam War. A staunch
&gt;anticommunist, Daniel Camejo looked askance at his son's politics,
&gt;but the two remained close; they sailed together in the 1960 Olympics
&gt;for Venezuela.
&gt;
&gt;Like many radicals during the 1960s, Peter Camejo found his way to
&gt;Berkeley. His role in campus activism there led then-Gov. Ronald
&gt;Reagan to brand him "one of the most dangerous men in America." In
&gt;the fall of 1967, as he ran on an activist slate for a position in
&gt;student government, police arrested Camejo the night before the
&gt;election, apparently for speaking at an unauthorized rally. He was
&gt;not charged with a crime, he recalled, but was expelled after winning
&gt;the election.
&gt;
&gt;Though he recalls that he remained "pretty square" in personal
&gt;demeanor--close-cropped hair, no drugs--Camejo remained something of
&gt;a perpetual activism machine for the next decade. He traveled
&gt;throughout Latin America trying to free political prisoners. He was
&gt;deported from Mexico while trying to liberate his activist brother,
&gt;who was at the time imprisoned in Mexico City. Back in the United
&gt;States, Camejo in 1976 ran for president on the Socialist ticket. "We
&gt;got on the ballot in 18 states," he recalled proudly, and he won
&gt;91,314 votes.
&gt;
&gt;Throughout the decade, Daniel Camejo recalled fretting about his
&gt;son's future. "It was an honor to have a son doing what he was
&gt;doing," said the elder Camejo. But, he added, "we tried to induce him
&gt;to do something for himself."
&gt;
&gt;As the rollicking '70s moved into the more staid '80s, the younger
&gt;Camejo came to a realization: He was unemployed and broke, and did
&gt;not even have a college degree. He applied for a job with the post
&gt;office in California.
&gt;
&gt;A friend warned that postal work would aggravate Camejo's bad
&gt;back. "Go work in one of the brokerage houses," the friend
&gt;advised. "They like people who talk real fast."
&gt;
&gt;Camejo landed at Merrill Lynch and began working as a broker. But he
&gt;did not lose his political edge. In 1987, when the firm rejected his
&gt;proposal to create an individual retirement account that gave money
&gt;to AIDS groups, Camejo could not compromise. He formed Progressive
&gt;Asset Management, a company in the Bay Area city of Concord that
&gt;steers clients' money into companies that follow certain social
&gt;criteria--declining to use sweatshop labor, sell firearms and so on.
&gt;
&gt;Throughout his business years, Camejo has kept a toe in leftist
&gt;politics. He was one of the original U.S. Green Party members when
&gt;the party registered in 1991. He became a trustee of Contra Costa
&gt;County's pension fund and led a movement to have it push the
&gt;companies it invests in to act progressively.
&gt;
&gt;In 1998, the California Green Party began to cast about for
&gt;candidates for statewide office. Former Rep. Dan Hamburg agreed to
&gt;run for governor, and Camejo was poised to put his name on the ticket
&gt;for a lower office. But Camejo pulled out at the last minute to fend
&gt;off a Wall Street firm's raid on his brokerage.
&gt;
&gt;This year there is nothing holding him back. Next month he will step
&gt;down from his position on the Contra Costa County pension board to
&gt;free himself up to spend more time campaigning.
&gt;
&gt;Campaign Has Small War Chest
&gt;
&gt;The campaign has raised about $20,000 in contributions, usually
&gt;netted in small increments at fund-raisers like one held at a brew
&gt;pub near UC Davis during the Whole Earth festival. (The campaign
&gt;saves money by having the candidate--who said he made $306,000 last
&gt;year and is worth "under $2 million"--pay his own travel expenses.)
&gt;In contrast, Davis has more than $30 million in the bank and Simon
&gt;more than $5 million to communicate with voters via television, radio
&gt;and mailings.
&gt;
&gt;Devoting so much time to such an impractical pursuit amuses some of
&gt;Camejo's friends, like business colleague Joe Sturdivant. "To be
&gt;honest, that is a puzzle," said Sturdivant, a self-described
&gt;conservative who has been friends with Camejo for 15 years. "He's fit
&gt;into the capitalistic system quite well, but he still cares about
&gt;some of the social issues."
&gt;
&gt;The effort makes sense to the candidate. He says he sees it as a
&gt;chance to bring more Latinos and other ethnic minorities to the Green
&gt;Party and publicize proposed voting reforms that would allow a run-
&gt;off should one candidate fail to get the majority of votes--a method
&gt;that he argues would break the two major parties' grip on the
&gt;electorate.
&gt;
&gt;Camejo says he has changed since he ran for president. "I've re-
&gt;evaluated my views about how to achieve things," he said over a late
&gt;lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in Marina del Rey. "There's less
&gt;nuttiness."
&gt;
&gt;Later that day, Camejo braved a traffic-choked, 21/2-hour drive to
&gt;North Hills to speak to about 35 people at a progressive church. To
&gt;pass the time until the main speaker arrived, various members of the
&gt;crowd took turns addressing the graying audience on the threats of
&gt;corporations selling water and the merits of complex, European-style
&gt;voting systems.
&gt;
&gt;Camejo gave his standard hourlong talk, taking swipes at Sen. Barbara
&gt;Boxer and U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland)--the only member of
&gt;Congress to vote against a motion giving President Bush leeway to
&gt;retaliate for Sept.11--for saying positive things about the
&gt;president's war on terror. After the gathering disbanded, Terrie
&gt;Brady approached Camejo and softly said that she thought it was
&gt;counterproductive to attack Boxer, one of the nation's most liberal
&gt;senators.
&gt;
&gt;Camejo launched into a rapid-fire debate with Brady, tossing out the
&gt;names of Bay Area politicians he believed had betrayed their
&gt;beliefs. "I don't know the situation," Brady protested.
&gt;
&gt;"Well," Camejo replied in a steely tone, "I'm trying to tell you
&gt;something.... If you enter politics, you can choose to tell the
&gt;truth, or you can lie."
&gt;
&gt;There was a long silence, then Brady and Camejo parted.

&gt;CAMPAIGN 2002
&gt;A Man of the '60s for the 21st Century
&gt;Governor's race: Green Party candidate Peter Camejo won't win, but
&gt;he wants to make waves.
&gt;
&gt;By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;He's a financier who wants to become governor, thinks Californians
&gt;are overtaxed and says he is disgusted that Gray Davis failed to
&gt;follow basic business principles during the energy crisis.
&gt;
&gt;The candidate is not Republican Bill Simon Jr., but the Green Party's
&gt;nominee for governor, Peter Miguel Camejo. He is probably the only
&gt;person on the ballot in November who has sailed in the Olympics, been
&gt;expelled from Berkeley, run for president as a Socialist and founded
&gt;his own money management firm.
&gt;
&gt;Camejo, 62, travels in a 10-year-old Infiniti convertible plastered
&gt;with "Ralph Nader for President" bumper stickers, touting his new
&gt;book on socially responsible investing (with introductions written by
&gt;both Nader and a former Reagan administration official) and taking
&gt;potshots at the political establishment. On an Oracle official's
&gt;handing a $25,000 campaign contribution to Davis' director of e-
&gt;government in a bar: "If he's going to engage in corruption, he
&gt;should at least do it right. It should be in unmarked bills."
&gt;
&gt;On the prevalence of religion in politics: "If it was really true
&gt;that people turn over in their graves, Thomas Jefferson and George
&gt;Washington would be sources of perpetual energy."
&gt;
&gt;Camejo says he is under no illusions that he will become California's
&gt;next governor--"my wife would kill me"--but relishes the threat his
&gt;candidacy could pose to Davis by peeling off liberal voters. And he
&gt;says he is unconcerned about the possibility that, if the race
&gt;tightens, he could tip the election to the conservative underdog
&gt;Simon, far further from Camejo ideologically than Davis.
&gt;
&gt;"You can't solve problems gradually and peacefully," Camejo
&gt;said. "You have to make it an explosion."
&gt;
&gt;Democrats say they're not worried. "Since most voters don't take them
&gt;seriously, we don't," state party strategist Bob Mulholland said of
&gt;the Greens. He noted that after 10 years as an official party, Greens
&gt;compose a little less than 1% of California's registered
&gt;voters. "There's no more solid evidence of their inability to get any
&gt;base in the state of California."
&gt;
&gt;The 146,251 registered California Greens lag far behind the state's
&gt;5.3 million registered Republicans and 6.8 million Democrats. The
&gt;Greens racked up nearly 40,000 new California members in 2000 during
&gt;Nader's presidential run but barely added any voters in the last
&gt;year, according to state statistics.
&gt;
&gt;In most California elections, 4% to 5% of the voters abandon the two
&gt;major parties to back other candidates, but no single party has been
&gt;able to consolidate that wayward segment of the electorate. Nader
&gt;pulled 3.8% of California voters during the 2000 presidential
&gt;election, but analysts attribute that relatively robust showing
&gt;partly to his celebrity.
&gt;
&gt;That means that the only effect Camejo is likely to have on the
&gt;governor's race is to take votes from Davis in a tight contest, a
&gt;scenario that clearly pleases the Simon campaign. The other third-
&gt;party candidates--on the American Independent, Libertarian and
&gt;Natural Law tickets--can also only hope to peel a relatively few
&gt;votes from the two main parties.
&gt;
&gt;Bruce Cain, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, said it's too early
&gt;to tell whether Camejo will be a spoiler. "There will be leftists who
&gt;will take a look at the Greens," Cain said. "It would certainly be a
&gt;help to the Democrats if the guy was a total kook."
&gt;
&gt;Business and Leftist Politics
&gt;
&gt;After 45 minutes of speaking to six UC Santa Cruz students recently
&gt;about the need to legalize gay marriage, ban the death penalty,
&gt;implement a $10.50 statewide minimum wage and save California's
&gt;remaining old-growth forests, Camejo scrunched into a supporter's
&gt;hybrid gas-electric car and grabbed his cellular phone.
&gt;
&gt;"Tell me what happened at the close?" he asked after exchanging
&gt;pleasantries with the caller, a hedge fund manager. "What are the
&gt;futures doing now? Did they continue down at the close?"
&gt;
&gt;The Camejo campaign is full of such intersections of 21st century
&gt;capitalism and 1960s radicalism. He laces his talks with standard
&gt;leftist applause lines--condemning U.S. aggression during the war on
&gt;terrorism, or talking about how corporations need to be reined in.
&gt;
&gt;But moments later, he gleefully rattles off terms like "Triple-A Muni
&gt;at 10%" while excitedly talking about a new business venture to
&gt;structure loans to help homeowners install solar energy. He argues
&gt;that California's taxes are too high and that money is wasted on
&gt;giveaways to both corporations and public sector unions.
&gt;
&gt;On the stump, Camejo takes on the demeanor of an irascible college
&gt;lecturer who has always harbored dreams of becoming a stand-up comic.
&gt;In a jacket and slacks with a crown of wiry hair, he skips from one
&gt;point to another, hands bouncing, frequently interrupting himself to
&gt;make some acidic wisecrack or fulminate about the world's injustices.
&gt;
&gt;One staple is for him to brandish a paper graph of the price of
&gt;natural gas in California over the last several years. During a
&gt;renewable-energy forum at a library outside Santa Cruz, Camejo traced
&gt;the prices as he asked when Davis chose to ink $43 billion in energy
&gt;contracts.
&gt;
&gt;"Here?" His finger moved up the curve. "Here? No, here!" He pointed
&gt;at the peak. "I can see any time now, they'll announce the worst
&gt;trade in the history of humanity," Camejo fumed. "This is three
&gt;standard deviations off a trend line!"
&gt;
&gt;Camejo's blend of business sense and left-wing politics brings him
&gt;full circle. He was born in New York to one of Venezuela's wealthiest
&gt;families; his father, Daniel Camejo, is a prosperous resort developer.
&gt;
&gt;It was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
&gt;enrolled in 1958, that Peter Camejo caught the activism bug. He
&gt;dropped out to march for civil rights with Martin Luther King Jr.
&gt;and, later, to organize against the Vietnam War. A staunch
&gt;anticommunist, Daniel Camejo looked askance at his son's politics,
&gt;but the two remained close; they sailed together in the 1960 Olympics
&gt;for Venezuela.
&gt;
&gt;Like many radicals during the 1960s, Peter Camejo found his way to
&gt;Berkeley. His role in campus activism there led then-Gov. Ronald
&gt;Reagan to brand him "one of the most dangerous men in America." In
&gt;the fall of 1967, as he ran on an activist slate for a position in
&gt;student government, police arrested Camejo the night before the
&gt;election, apparently for speaking at an unauthorized rally. He was
&gt;not charged with a crime, he recalled, but was expelled after winning
&gt;the election.
&gt;
&gt;Though he recalls that he remained "pretty square" in personal
&gt;demeanor--close-cropped hair, no drugs--Camejo remained something of
&gt;a perpetual activism machine for the next decade. He traveled
&gt;throughout Latin America trying to free political prisoners. He was
&gt;deported from Mexico while trying to liberate his activist brother,
&gt;who was at the time imprisoned in Mexico City. Back in the United
&gt;States, Camejo in 1976 ran for president on the Socialist ticket. "We
&gt;got on the ballot in 18 states," he recalled proudly, and he won
&gt;91,314 votes.
&gt;
&gt;Throughout the decade, Daniel Camejo recalled fretting about his
&gt;son's future. "It was an honor to have a son doing what he was
&gt;doing," said the elder Camejo. But, he added, "we tried to induce him
&gt;to do something for himself."
&gt;
&gt;As the rollicking '70s moved into the more staid '80s, the younger
&gt;Camejo came to a realization: He was unemployed and broke, and did
&gt;not even have a college degree. He applied for a job with the post
&gt;office in California.
&gt;
&gt;A friend warned that postal work would aggravate Camejo's bad
&gt;back. "Go work in one of the brokerage houses," the friend
&gt;advised. "They like people who talk real fast."
&gt;
&gt;Camejo landed at Merrill Lynch and began working as a broker. But he
&gt;did not lose his political edge. In 1987, when the firm rejected his
&gt;proposal to create an individual retirement account that gave money
&gt;to AIDS groups, Camejo could not compromise. He formed Progressive
&gt;Asset Management, a company in the Bay Area city of Concord that
&gt;steers clients' money into companies that follow certain social
&gt;criteria--declining to use sweatshop labor, sell firearms and so on.
&gt;
&gt;Throughout his business years, Camejo has kept a toe in leftist
&gt;politics. He was one of the original U.S. Green Party members when
&gt;the party registered in 1991. He became a trustee of Contra Costa
&gt;County's pension fund and led a movement to have it push the
&gt;companies it invests in to act progressively.
&gt;
&gt;In 1998, the California Green Party began to cast about for
&gt;candidates for statewide office. Former Rep. Dan Hamburg agreed to
&gt;run for governor, and Camejo was poised to put his name on the ticket
&gt;for a lower office. But Camejo pulled out at the last minute to fend
&gt;off a Wall Street firm's raid on his brokerage.
&gt;
&gt;This year there is nothing holding him back. Next month he will step
&gt;down from his position on the Contra Costa County pension board to
&gt;free himself up to spend more time campaigning.
&gt;
&gt;Campaign Has Small War Chest
&gt;
&gt;The campaign has raised about $20,000 in contributions, usually
&gt;netted in small increments at fund-raisers like one held at a brew
&gt;pub near UC Davis during the Whole Earth festival. (The campaign
&gt;saves money by having the candidate--who said he made $306,000 last
&gt;year and is worth "under $2 million"--pay his own travel expenses.)
&gt;In contrast, Davis has more than $30 million in the bank and Simon
&gt;more than $5 million to communicate with voters via television, radio
&gt;and mailings.
&gt;
&gt;Devoting so much time to such an impractical pursuit amuses some of
&gt;Camejo's friends, like business colleague Joe Sturdivant. "To be
&gt;honest, that is a puzzle," said Sturdivant, a self-described
&gt;conservative who has been friends with Camejo for 15 years. "He's fit
&gt;into the capitalistic system quite well, but he still cares about
&gt;some of the social issues."
&gt;
&gt;The effort makes sense to the candidate. He says he sees it as a
&gt;chance to bring more Latinos and other ethnic minorities to the Green
&gt;Party and publicize proposed voting reforms that would allow a run-
&gt;off should one candidate fail to get the majority of votes--a method
&gt;that he argues would break the two major parties' grip on the
&gt;electorate.
&gt;
&gt;Camejo says he has changed since he ran for president. "I've re-
&gt;evaluated my views about how to achieve things," he said over a late
&gt;lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in Marina del Rey. "There's less
&gt;nuttiness."
&gt;
&gt;Later that day, Camejo braved a traffic-choked, 21/2-hour drive to
&gt;North Hills to speak to about 35 people at a progressive church. To
&gt;pass the time until the main speaker arrived, various members of the
&gt;crowd took turns addressing the graying audience on the threats of
&gt;corporations selling water and the merits of complex, European-style
&gt;voting systems.
&gt;
&gt;Camejo gave his standard hourlong talk, taking swipes at Sen. Barbara
&gt;Boxer and U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland)--the only member of
&gt;Congress to vote against a motion giving President Bush leeway to
&gt;retaliate for Sept.11--for saying positive things about the
&gt;president's war on terror. After the gathering disbanded, Terrie
&gt;Brady approached Camejo and softly said that she thought it was
&gt;counterproductive to attack Boxer, one of the nation's most liberal
&gt;senators.
&gt;
&gt;Camejo launched into a rapid-fire debate with Brady, tossing out the
&gt;names of Bay Area politicians he believed had betrayed their
&gt;beliefs. "I don't know the situation," Brady protested.
&gt;
&gt;"Well," Camejo replied in a steely tone, "I'm trying to tell you
&gt;something.... If you enter politics, you can choose to tell the
&gt;truth, or you can lie."
&gt;
&gt;There was a long silence, then Brady and Camejo parted.

The Saga Continues With Doctor Solis Jordan
Hermes Ayala, Redactor, El Vocero

Marta Gonzalez, the wife of Jose Solis Jordan, has not heard or 
knownanything about her husband for exactly one week.  Yesterday she had 
tosettle for leaving a recorded message at the federal jail in 
Atlanta.Yesterday, Gonzalez spoke with the penitentiary where an official 
confirmedthat her husband was there and after que questioned why the lack 
ofcommunication with her husband, he referred her to another extension 
whereshe was only able to leave another recorded message."The only thing I 
have been able to do is to call Atlanta and leave amessage relating my 
concern", Gonzalez indicated.Her husband who is serving 51 months seditious 
conspiracy, was supposed toarrive in Puerto Rico last Tuesday, May 21, 2002, 
to finish his sentence atthe federal prison in Guaynabo and later at a 
half-way house where he wouldstay while working during the day on his way to 
adjusting agains to society.On November 22, 2002 his sentence would be 
completed.However, Solis Jordan continues enroute and his wife and familyl 
do not knowwhat else to do or believe."They assured me that he was in 
Atlanta, but until I can speak with him ...after all that has happended, you 
never know what could happen. You don'twant to exaggerate or be pessimistic 
... I have a lot of faith but the truthis that this federal government has 
been very unjust.  It is they themselvesthat are creating the doubts and 
worries. What won't they let him call me?",indicated Gonzalez.Gonzalez 
indicated that when she spoke with Atlanta she left the numbers ofher home 
and her cell phone, but until this time neither phone has rung withany good 
news.The lawyer in the case, Linda Backiel, has also tried to communicate 
withher client but her efforts have failed. "She doesn't know anything 
either,but the level of isolation they have him in seems to be total", was 
statedby Solis Jordan's wife. She has no choice but to wait and with each 
passing day, the time seems even longer and longer." The concern and worry 
of the family continues. I just want him to be able to call, because I don't 
even know if he has access to his personal things." Marta Gonzalez said and 
she was notably distressed.

<pre>DECOLONIZATION COMMITTEE URGES UNITED STATES TO HALT MILITARY MANOEUVRES
ON VIEQUES ISLAND, RETURN OCCUPIED LAND TO PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO



Acting without a Vote, Committee Also Calls
For Expedited Process to Allow Puerto Rican Self-Determination




      Bearing in mind that an official referendum held last July showed an 
overwhelming majority in favour of an immediate, permanent halt to military 
manoeuvres on Vieques, the Special Committee on Decolonization this 
afternoon urged the United States to immediate halt such military 
activities, as it approved a draft resolution on Puerto Rico.



Approving the text without a vote, the Special Committee also urged the 
United States to:  return the occupied land to the people of Puerto Rico; 
halt the persecutions, incarcerations, arrests and harassment of peaceful 
demonstrators; immediately release all persons incarcerated in this 
connection; respect the fundamental human rights of health and economic 
development; and decontaminate the impact areas.



      The Special Committee also called on the United States to assume its 
responsibility for expediting a process that would allow the Puerto Rican 
people fully to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and 
independence.  It further requested the President of the United States to 
release all Puerto Rican political prisoners serving sentences in United 
States prisons for cases related to the struggle for Puerto Rico�s 
independence.



      The representative of Cuba introduced the draft resolution.



More than 20 petitioners addressed the Special Committee during its 
consideration of Puerto Rico which began this morning, and a number of 
petitioners then emphasized the refusal by the United States to respect the 
outcome of last July�s referendum and its continued bombing exercises.  
Speakers also stressed the health hazards, environmental destruction and 
economic strangulation resulting from more than 60 years of bombings by the 
United States Navy.



In addition, whether they supported independence for Puerto Rico or full 
statehood within the United States, speakers agreed on the need to carry out 
the decolonization of Puerto Rico and for the island�s people to determine 
their future political status.  Although commonwealth status had its 
sympathizers, said one speaker, it would not eliminate the colonial 
condition but only perpetuate it.

5th and 6th Meetings (AM &amp; PM)





Another speaker said the refusal by the United States to accept or follow 
through on the conclusions arising from the referendum was a flagrant 
violation of the right to self-determination.  Both the referendum and the 
recognition of the need for a constitutional assembly were important 
additions to the draft resolution and would put pressure on those in Puerto 
Rico and the United States who wished to perpetuate colonialism.



      Statements were made by the representatives of Colegio de Abogados de 
Puerto Rico; Frente Socialista; Causa Com�n Independentista (Proyecto 
Educativo Puertorrique�o); Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico; San Romero 
de las Americas Church; Puerto Rican Independence Party; Committee for the

Inc.; PROELA; Gran Oriente Nacional de Puerto Rico; Primavera, Inc.; Al 
Frente; National Advancement for Puerto Rican Culture; Socialist Workers 
Party; and American Association of Jurists.



      Also making statements were the representatives of Venezuela, Iraq, 
Iran and Chile.

Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and 
Peoples -� will be announced.

      Background



      The Special Committee on Decolonization met this morning to consider 
the question of Puerto Rico.  It had before it draft resolution submitted by 
Cuba on the Special Committee decision of 21 July 2001 concerning Puerto 
Rico (document A/AC.109/2002/L.8), by which the Special Committee would urge 
the United States to:  order an immediate halt to its armed forces� military 
drills and manoeuvres on Vieques Island, which is inhabited; return the 
occupied land to the people of Puerto Rico; halt the persecutions, 
incarcerations, arrests and harassment of peaceful demonstrators; 
immediately release all persons incarcerated in this connection; respect 
fundamental human rights, such as the right to health and economic 
development; and decontaminate the impact areas.



      The Committee would also call on the United States to assume its 
responsibility of expediting a process that will allow the Puerto Rican 
people to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and 
independence, in conformity with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and 
the resolutions and decisions of the Special Committee concerning Puerto 
Rico.  Also, the Committee would request the President of the United States 
to release all Puerto Rican political prisoners serving sentences in United 
States prisons for cases related to the struggle for Puerto Rico�s 
independence.



The Committee also had before it a report prepared by its Rapporteur, 
Fayssal Mekdad (Syria) (document A/AC.109/2002/L.4), on the Committee�s 
decision of 22 June 2001 concerning Puerto Rico, which considers the 
question of Puerto Rico in the light of previous reports, recent political 
developments in Puerto Rico, action taken by United Nations bodies on the 
question and the views of the parties concerned.  Annexed to the report is a 
list of organizations contacted to provide updated information on 
self-determination and independence with respect to Puerto Rico.



Also before the Committee were requests for hearing, contained in 
aides-m�moire 8/02/Add.1 to 10/02.



      Statements



      JAIME RUBERTE, Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, said that last year 
he had explained the problem regarding the death penalty, which could be 
applied under federal law, although it was prohibited by Puerto Rico.  It 
was both humiliating and unjust that Puerto Ricans could not try our their 
own citizens on their own territory.



He said that last year a referendum was held on Vieques.  The overwhelming 
majority had voted for a cessation of United States bombings and a clean-up 
of contaminated areas.  The United States did not respect the result of that 
referendum and continued to carry out bombing exercises.  He also referred 
to the abuses carried out by the United States in relation to Vieques.  The 
situation there had remained the same or worsened with regard to detainment.



      On the political situation, he said that Puerto Rico had adopted a 
resolution to carry out a study on the establishment of a constitutional 
assembly.  The Government had decided to appoint a body to determine the 
status of Puerto Rico.  It adopted a resolution in October 2001, which, 
among other things, recognized that the United States had not adopted a 
decolonization policy.  The people of Puerto Rico had wanted a 
constitutional assembly to determine their own legal status and discuss 
their own sovereignty.  That assembly represented the political will of the 
people and it would sit independently of the United States with the election 
of delegates.



He urged Puerto Rico�s Legislative Assembly to adopt a policy regarding that 
assembly.  The College of Lawyers felt that the assembly was brought 
together to draft a constitution and would support that process.  Also, he 
endorsed the adoption of the draft resolution before the Committee.



      JORGE FARINACCI GARCIA, Frente Socialista, noting that the Government 
of the United States had maintained a colonial regime in Puerto Rico since 
1898, said that since last summer the Puerto Rican people's resistance 
against Navy exercises had led to more than 2,000 people being charged in 
federal court.  Dozens had been incarcerated for defending Vieques and many 
more had been tried.  The matter was still unresolved, owing to the 
stubbornness of the United States Government.



He said there had been more than a century of mistreatment and abuse of the 
Puerto Rican people by the various branches of the United States military 
and by companies established in the territory.  The United States Government 
now wanted to establish the death penalty, which was banned under Puerto 
Rico's Constitution.  The Puerto Rican people were facing that and numerous 
other examples of colonial subordination.



      However, it was certain that there was a cause that aimed at changing 
the colonial reality existing in Puerto Rico, he said. On the other hand, 
pro-colonial groups were fighting against the clearest evidence of 
colonialism, including corruption and drug-trafficking.  Recent statistical 
studies showed that Puerto Rico had the second highest per capita murder 
rate in the world after Colombia, which was suffering an internal war.  The 
people would accept no less than the right to self-determination, 
independence and the release of political prisoners.  The draft resolution 
should be submitted to the General Assembly as soon as possible.



      CARLOS VIZCARRONDO-IRIZARRY, House of Representatives of Puerto Rico, 
said that in July Puerto Rico would celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of 
its Constitution.  The Puerto Rican constitutional convention, which had 
drafted that document, had also adopted a resolution by which the people of 
Puerto Rico could revise the status of its relationship with the United 
States.  Forty-nine years had gone by during which Puerto Rico and the 
United States had failed in their attempts to resolve the political future 
of Puerto Rico.  Plebiscites had been held and commissions had been 
established, but those efforts had not been successful.



The present Government of Puerto Rico would convene a commission of Puerto 
Rican unity to explore mechanisms to determine Puerto Rico�s course to 
self-determination, he said.  In that regard, it was exploring the idea of 
establishing a constitutional convention to determine the future status of 
Puerto Rico.  He would favour a people�s assembly or constitutional 
convention to determine Puerto Rico�s future.



      The people of Vieques, by a majority of 70 per cent, had stated their 
views through the referendum held last year, he said.  The President of the 
United States had stated that the Navy would leave Vieques by May 2003.  The 
Special Committee should mention the situation in Vieques and call for the 
immediate cessation of military exercises there.  That territory should be 
returned to the people and cleaned up by the United States.  He urged the 
Committee to adopt an expression of Puerto Rico�s natural right to 
self-determination.



      MANUEL GONZALEZ, Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico, said the 
establishment by the United States of the so-called Free Associated State of 
Puerto Rico had long deceived world opinion and some Puerto Ricans.  Like 
every other colony, Puerto Rico had suffered, and only concerted action by 
its people and institutions would make it possible for the territory to 
become a free sovereign and independent nation.  However, time was too short 
to recount the history of Puerto Rico's colonization, or to enumerate the 
ills visited on its people.



He said it was not the time to expand on the hypocrisy of those who claimed 
to be the champions of democracy in the world, while they strangled the 
freedom of the Cuban people and refused to recognize their right to forge 
their own destiny.  In addition, they attempted to suppress the sovereign 
will of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and permitted the massacre of 
the Palestinian people.  Through brutal force they had tried to impose their 
will on all corners of the world.  Puerto Rico must be free and sovereign 
today, he emphasized.



      LUIS BARRIOS, Reverend of the San Romero de las Americas Church, said 
that he was here to denounce the political sin of colonialism committed by 
the United States against Puerto Rico.  The United States had unleashed its 
war against terrorism following 11 September.  While it had identified 
others as supporters of terrorism, their own acts of political terrorism had 
been perpetrated under the cloak of national security.  The United States 
invaded and occupied Puerto Rico in 1898.  In 1917, the United States 
Government imposed United States citizenship on Puerto Rico against the will 
of its people.  Ironically, that was done three weeks before the First World 
War broke out, conferring mandatory military service on the people of Puerto 
Rico.  Then, in 1940, the United States military began military exercises on 
Vieques.



It was necessary to constantly question what was known as elections in 
Puerto Rico, he added.  While they were supposed to be democratic, they were 
conducted by an administration that carried out the policies of the United 
States on the island.  Puerto Rico was still a colony of the United States.  
That sin was still being perpetrated by the United States.  It was necessary 
to begin a process of decolonization and self-determination.  In addition, 
the United States should shoulder its responsibility of restoring economic 
justice in Puerto Rico after  104 years of colonialism.



      FERNANDO MARTIN-GARCIA, Puerto Rican Independence Party, said many 
cynics and sceptics had said that the Committee's resolutions were 
meaningless and could be ignored.  The same had been said of its resolutions 
on East Timor, which had recently gained full independence.  Unexpected 
political changes in Indonesia had created a new circumstance to bring about 
an event that had previously seemed impossible.  That would have been 
impossible without the international community's recognition of East Timor's 
right to self-determination.  Those who underestimated the Organization's 
role in decolonization betrayed an ignorance of history.



      He said the draft resolution before the Committee contained two 
elements that strengthened last year's text.  One involved the demand by 
more than 70 per cent of the Puerto Rican, as expressed in the referendum, 
that the Navy put an end to its bombing exercises on Vieques and clean up 
the island.  The refusal by the United States to accept or follow through on 
those conclusions was a flagrant violation of the right to 
self-determination.  Both last year's referendum and the recognition of the 
need for a constitutional assembly for Puerto Rico were important additions 
to the draft resolution and would put pressure on those in Puerto Rico and 
the United States who wished to perpetuate colonialism.  Yesterday East 
Timor, tomorrow Puerto Rico, he concluded.



      ISMAEL GUADALUPE, Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques, 
said that Vieques was being used as a weapons depository and training camp 
for the United States military.  The Special Committee had determined that 
the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States was colonial in 
nature.



He first wanted to highlight the new violations of human rights against the 
people of Vieques, who had made it clear through a referendum to the Navy 
what it wanted.  Two thirds of the voters on Vieques voted in favour of the 
Navy leaving immediately.  In response, the Navy had unleashed more 
brutality during demonstrations held against it.  Today, the Government of 
Puerto Rico had not called on the Government of the United States to respect 
the will expressed during the referendum.  Also, nothing had been said about 
the fact that death due to cancer had risen in Vieques.



His second point was that it was necessary to put pressure on the United 
States Navy to compensate the inhabitants of Vieques for 60 years of 
destruction.  The presence of the Navy had meant the economic strangulation 
of the people of the island.  Following the Navy�s departure, the clean-up 
of Vieques must begin.  In that connection, he insisted on the following 
four points:  demilitarisation; return of land; decontamination; and 
development.  The Special Committee must denounce United States activity on 
Vieques and support full withdrawal and compensation by the United States.



      EDWIN PAGAN, ProLibertad Freedom Campaign, said the dissolution by the 
United States of its colonial control over Puerto Rico would cause a domino 
effect on other such administering Powers, which would then end their 
control over the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories.  Despite the 
ability of Puerto Ricans to travel between the United States and Puerto Rico 
without a passport, it was still a colonial territory.



He said that, despite the release of some Puerto Rican political prisoners, 
others had been incarcerated for their political beliefs.  Their value and 
efforts were concrete proof of the determination of Puerto Ricans to achieve 
self-determination.  By legislation enacted by the Governor of Puerto Rico 
last July, a referendum had been held in which more than 80.5 per cent of 
the population had participated.  Of those, more than 70 per cent had voted 
that the United States Navy immediately withdraw from Vieques and that it 
clean up the island's beaches.



      Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September, he said, it had become 
clear that the United States Government would use different means to fight 
against international terrorism.  The decisions arising from those tragic 
events had, in turn, rendered obsolete the United States Navy�s need to use 
the beaches of Vieques for its bombing exercises.  In that light, the 
failure by the United States Navy and Government to heed the will of the 
people of Vieques and Puerto Rico could only be described as arrogance.



      JUAN MARI BRAS, on behalf of Causa Com�n Independentista (Proyecto 
Educativo Puertorrique�o), said that the most basic understanding should 
indicate to the United States and the United Nations that the question of 
Puerto Rico needed to be discussed in a forum of greater authority, such as 
the International Court of Justice.  He requested that that the 
recommendation be included in the resolution to be adopted this year.



It was time to overcome the deadlock between the United States and the 
Special Committee, he continued.  That was particularly important this year, 
because the Puerto Rican people were nearing a crucial moment in their 
history.  The old imperialist policy of divide and conquer had begun to 
collapse.  A greater number of organizations and peoples had become 
convinced that it was necessary to overcome inter-Puerto Rican differences 
and call for a mechanism leading to consensus on the path to decolonization. 
  He hoped the resolution would reflect the progress and changes in the 
struggle of the Puerto Rican people.



      BETTY BRASSELL, United for Vieques, Puerto Rico, Inc., said that her 
organization was a group of individuals committed for peace for Vieques.  
Its goal was to create awareness and keep civil society informed about the 
health hazards and the ecological and economic destruction caused by the 
United States Navy on Vieques, as well as to inspire others to actively 
protect their communities.



She had gone to Vieques with a group of people to participate in civil 
disobedience, and found it hard to believe the people there were talking 
about the United States Government and Navy, which was supposedly committed 
to protecting its citizens.  Bombs devastated the environment, destroyed the 
earth and helped to eliminate various species of wildlife.  They were an 
abuse of people and the land.  Could one imagine what bombs did to a small 
island like Vieques?  The United States Navy knew that, but had continued to 
bomb and contaminate the island for more than 61 years.  The international 
community�s voice and indignation was not being clearly heard.  A strong 
statement must be made in the Committee�s deliberations to bring peace to 
Vieques.



      JULIO MURIENTE, Nuevo Movimiento Independentista Puertorique�o, 
congratulating the people and Government of East Timor for their heroic 
achievement of independence, said that in less than two months Puerto Ricans 
would mark the anniversary of the invasion of their country by the United 
States.  While there was no doubt that there was an unresolved political 
problem, there were differences about which path to follow in resolving it.  
The main obstacle was the lack of political will on the part of the United 
States.



Worse was the fact that the Government of the United States refused to 
recognize that there was a colonial problem that had lasted more than a 
century, he said.  It could be seen with ever-greater diversity and breadth 
of scope that there was a need to end bombing exercises on Vieques.  People 
from all political parties had expressed their will in the referendum, in 
which 80 per cent of the voting public had participated.  Almost 70 per cent 
of those had voted for the end to bombing and the withdrawal of the Navy.



The response of the United States to that overwhelming rejection had been to 
resume bombing two weeks later and to imprison the Mayor of Vieques, he 
noted.  Although President George W. Bush had pledged to remove the Navy, 
the great question now remained:  how much will remained among the Puerto 
Ricans regarding the annexation of their country?  Draft laws were being 
promoted in Congress for direct control of rivers, as well as annexation.  
Such proposals threatened the fiscal integrity and resources of the nation.



      HECTOR L. PESQUERA, on behalf of Congreso Nacional Hostosiano, said 
that since the adoption of the Committee�s resolution in July 2001, 
important events had taken place which violated the human rights of the 
people of Puerto Rico.  At present, Vieques fishermen, members of the 
religious community and other civilians were in prison.  Through 
environmental colonialism, the United States Navy was destroying 
archaeological and aquatic sites, carrying out exercises with harmful 
substances.  In addition, before the United States Congress was a draft law, 
which would appropriate more than 100,000 hectares of land in northern 
Puerto Rico.  Also, a draft law, adopted in the House of Representatives, 
would affect three major rivers in Puerto Rico.  That draft was currently 
before the Senate.  He called on the United States to decontaminate more 
than 79 areas, which had been used by the United States military in the past 
and since abandoned.



      The people of Puerto Rico had come up against the federal Government 
in exercising the rights enshrined in the Constitution, which was adopted 50 
years ago, he said.  In the past year there had been constant violations of 
that Constitution by the United States Government.  Among them was the 
imposition of the death penalty in Puerto Rico, which was prohibited by the 
Constitution of Puerto Rico.  First of all, the case of Puerto Rico should 
be included as a separate item on the agenda of the upcoming General 
Assembly.  Second, it should be recognized that the only people that could 
change the Constitution of Puerto Rico were the Puerto Ricans themselves.



Third, he continued, the United States must respect the rules and laws 
established by Puerto Rico in the management and protection of Puerto Rico�s 
natural resources.  He invited the Special Committee to visit Puerto Rico to 
witness the damage caused by military exercises on Vieques.  Fourth, the 
people�s assembly should be involved in the decolonization of Puerto Rico.  
He rejected any proposal to integrate Puerto Rico into the federal system of 
the United States.  Fifth, the United States Government should respect the 
outcome of the referendum conducted in July 2001, which called for the 
immediate withdrawal of the United States military from Vieques.  Sixth, 
amnesty should be granted to all Puerto Ricans involved in the freedom 
struggle for Puerto Rico.



      FRANK VELGARA, Vieques Support Campaign, said the continued bombing on 
Vieques not only represented a clear and present danger to the lives, 
health, social and political well-being of the island's inhabitants, but 
also a direct example of the colonial political control exercised by the 
United States since 1898.  The people were affected by mercury poisoning of 
the air, water, flora and fauna, in addition to continuing to live in a vast 
death trap that could only be described as death on the instalment plan.



      The reality of Puerto Rico exposed the lie of participatory democracy 
claimed by the United States, he said.  Hundreds of people had been arrested 
in Puerto Rico, in the United States and elsewhere for demanding an end to 
bombing and other harmful practices.  The racist treatment of those arrested 
stood clear for the world to see.



Just a few weeks ago, the world had seen an attempt by anti-democracy forces 
to stage a coup in Venezuela, he recalled.  In the past, Vieques had been 
the launch pad and rehearsal site for invasions of the Dominican Republic 
and Grenada.  In Vieques, all Puerto Ricans could see their colonial status, 
as well as the racism and discrimination that had been the lot of all 
nations under colonial domination.  According to a Puerto Rican saying, one 
could not cover the sky with one hand.  In other words, a colony remained so 
under any other name.



      WILFREDO SANTIAGO VALIENTE, United Statehooders Organization of New 
York, Inc., said that self-determination did not necessarily imply 
independence for a group of people.  If the Committee wished to support the 
decolonization of Puerto Rico, it was imperative that any resolution adopted 
by it recognize resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions, which 
endorsed three options for the decolonization of a territory.  The case of 
Puerto Rico brought up the issue of sovereignty, not autonomy.  In 
international law, autonomy referred to political decentralization. On 25 
July, Puerto Rico would celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its 
Constitution.  He wanted a referendum on statehood or independence to 
determine the future status of Puerto Rico.



      ELSIE VALDES, Puertorique�os ante la ONU, Inc., said that, while the 
alternatives of political status had been discussed for several years, it 
should be remembered that Puerto Rico was subject to the territorial laws of 
the United States, whose Congress could unilaterally decide its destiny.  
There was no bilateral pact whatsoever between Puerto Rico and the United 
States.  Puerto Rico was an unincorporated territory, or colony, and had no 
sovereignty.



The United States could have solved the issue of Puerto Rico's political 
status as a domestic matter, but it had not done so, she said.  Likewise, 
the United Nations, where solutions for such matters were presented, had 
also not resolved it.  Only resolutions had been presented.  While her 
organization believed firmly in American citizenship and desired permanent 
union with the United States, it would respect the choice of the majority.



Puerto Rico was a colony and would remain so until a permanent definition 
was established, she emphasized.  The independence movement in the territory 
had only been able to achieve 45 per cent in support for its cause.  
Although commonwealth status had its sympathizers, it would not eliminate 
the colonial condition, but only perpetuate it.  Puerto Ricans had been 
American since 1917, but were prevented from enjoying the same privileges as 
other Americans without losing their identity as a people.



      HAYDEE RIVERA, Puertorique�os Pro Estadidad, Inc., said that her 
organization had called for a resolution of the political problem of Puerto 
Rico though the granting of statehood.  In 1953, representatives of Puerto 
Rico and the United States, before the General Assembly, had stated that 
people of Puerto Rico had exercised their right to self-determination, and a 
resolution had been adopted removing Puerto Rico from the list of 
Non-Self-Governing Territories �- resolution 748 (VIII).  However, the 
people of Puerto Rico had not been allowed to determine their status, as 
called for in resolution 1514.  General Assembly resolution 748 (VIII) had 
never been fully enforced.  The people needed to select one of the options 
outlined in resolution 1514.



Her organization had maintained that statehood would be the most effective 
way of ensuring the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico.  Congress 
should recognize permanent legal status for the island.  Statehood would 
provide for equal participation in the political process.  That was decision 
that should be left up to the Puerto Ricans.



      LUIS VEGA RAMOS, PROELA, said the discussion was taking place in light 
of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the commonwealth's 
Constitution.  While that document reflected the right of future Puerto 
Ricans to decide their political status, claims to greater 
self-determination or autonomy had not been thoroughly heard, and another 
mechanism was required to address that concern.



      He said claims for sovereignty had followed the adoption in 1960 of 
resolutions 1540 and 1541 by the United Nations General Assembly. The claim 
for sovereignty had been reaffirmed in the 2000 elections.  Free association 
was nothing but full autonomy of the commonwealth.  The resolution adopted 
by the Committee in 1978 reaffirmed its right to self-determination and 
sovereignty.



The United States had not complied with the prerequisites of integration or 
the right of accession as contained in resolution 1541, he said.  It was 
because of that lack of right of accession that there had already been a 
civil war in the United States.  The Mayor of Vieques was among hundreds of 
Puerto Ricans imprisoned for demanding an immediate end to bombing and a 
clean-up of the island.  Ending the bombing was a right and should not be a 
subject of negotiations, he said.



      BRUNO RODRIGUEZ PARRILLA (Cuba), introducing the draft resolution on 
Puerto Rico, said that the common history and special relationship between 
Cuba and Puerto Rico could be summed up in the words, �Cuba and Puerto Rico 
were the two wings of the same bird.�  The text before the Committee 
reiterated the basic elements of resolutions previously adopted by Special 
Committee.  Since 1973, resolutions of the Special Committee had reaffirmed 
the inalienable right of



Puerto Ricans to the right to self-determination and the applicability of 
resolution 1514 to Puerto Rico.  After more than 100 years of political 
domination and military occupation, Puerto Ricans had shown their 
determination to maintain their distinct cultural identity.



A consensus existed among Puerto Ricans to put an end to the situation in 
Vieques, he noted.  According to environmental studies, it would take 
decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to clean the areas affected by 
the bombings.  New sections of text drew attention to the referendum held 
last July regarding United States withdrawal from Vieques and requested the 
United States President to release Puerto Rican political prisoners.  He 
called on the Committee to adopt the text by consensus.



      NELSON CANALS, Gran Oriente Nacional de Puerto Rico, paying tribute to 
the people of East Timor on the occasion of their independence, said his 
organization had been appearing before the Special Committee since 1972. 
Successive generations of Puerto Ricans had committed themselves to 
achieving social and economic freedom, as a result of which many were now 
held in United States prisons.



Freedom fighters had been forced to go into hiding or flee their homeland to 
escape oppression, he said.  Their right to return must be guaranteed.  
Puerto Rican determination to end repression had most recently been made 
clear through the tenacious resistance to the military operations on 
Vieques.  That had led to the arrest of protestors and their sentencing to 
disproportionate jail sentences.



Noting that the Puerto Rican legislature had repealed the death penalty 
since 1929, he said it remained banned under the 1952 Constitution.  
Attempts to introduce that barbaric measure was another flagrant violation 
of Puerto Rican sovereignty.  Gran Oriente denounced such attempts and hoped 
the Special Committee would take action to end the situation in Puerto Rico, 
the world's oldest colony.



      ANITA VELEZ MITCHELL, Primavera, Inc., said that she was born in 
Vieques.  As a child, she was witness to the agrarian fall of Vieques.  The 
United States naval base might finally leave the island in 2003.  Puerto 
Ricans were now going through an identity crisis.  Eight hundred Puerto 
Ricans perished on 11 September.  However, they were counted among the 
Hispanics.  When they were called to war, they were identified as Americans. 
  After the hideous attack in Central Park, they were labelled as Puerto 
Ricans, even though there was only one Puerto Rican in that group of men, 
that too a �New Yorican�.  The idea was to find a way to recover the dignity 
of the people of Puerto Rico.



      JOSE ADAMES, Al Frente, said that despite being one of the best 
democracies in the world, United States history was filled with 
discrimination.  Even some map makers did not include Puerto Rico in the 
maps of the United States.  Puerto Rico was a victim of discrimination in 
many ways.  It became a territory of the United States before some States of 
the Union.  Its Government was equal to that of any other State of the 
United States.



Puerto Rico, he said, should have received statehood.  It had more United 
States citizens than some American States.  Puerto Rico was a State of the 
United States in every way.  Puerto Rican soldiers and police had given 
their life for the United States.  He called on the President of the United 
States to put a stop to that historical insult by submitting a declaration 
of statehood to the United States Congress.



      NILDA LUZ REXACH, National Advancement for Puerto Rican Culture, 
stressed that there was no moral or legal principle that could justify 
leaving more than

3 million people without self-determination.  The disenfranchised Puerto 
Rican people included thousands who had given their lives in American wars, 
and yet they had no right to political representation in the United States.  
There was no legal definition for the former and present status of Puerto 
Rico, which was neither free nor associated.



She said it had long been clear that the Constitution of the United States 
would supersede the will of the Puerto Rican people on any occasion.  Puerto 
Rican culture remained the same mixed culture that had always existed on the 
island, yet English was now being imposed on the territory.  Full statehood 
was the only solution, she stressed.



The Special Committee must not be misled by clever manipulation of the 
Vieques issue, she cautioned.  That situation was the fault of inaction by 
Congress, which had failed to safeguard health, peace and order on the 
island.   In addition, the people of Puerto Rico demanded that President 
George W. Bush   end historical discrimination against the Puerto Rican 
people, who fully deserved the status of American citizens of the union's 
fifty-first State.



      ROGER CALERO, Socialist Workers Party, demanded the immediate 
withdrawal of the United States Navy from Vieques and the release of all 
those imprisoned in that regard.  A successful struggle for independence was 
in the interest of not only the Puerto Ricans, but also the people of the 
United States.  It would show that it was possible to stand up to the mighty 
power of the United States.  For more than a century, the United States had 
maintained Puerto Rico as its colony, a fact which it had unsuccessfully 
tried to cover up.  Today, the United States was turning to its military 
might to impose its power.  The establishment of a United States-dominated 
protectorate in Afghanistan exposed that Washington�s so-called war on 
terror was just a war on other peoples and nations.



Today, he said, there were still five Puerto Rican political prisoners 
detained in the United States, due to their ideas and actions with regard to 
Puerto Rico�s independence.  He joined others in demanding their immediate 
release.  Puerto Ricans in the United States represented a significant 
portion of the country�s workforce.  Since Washington invaded Puerto Rico 
over a century ago, it had been used as a launching pad for military action 
against other countries, such as Grenada.  The militarization of Puerto Rico 
reinforced the United States� intention to establish military bases in other 
Latin American countries.



      VANESSA RAMOS, American Association of Jurists, said that the word 
"American" in her organization's name sought to embrace all countries of the 
Americas, with the understanding that many of the conflicts had been the 
result of intervention by the United States.  The Association defended the 
right of the Puerto Rican people to self-determination and independence.



      She reaffirmed that the United States Navy must immediately and 
unconditionally stop its military activities and dismantle all warlike 
equipment



stored on Vieques.  The Navy's experimentation with depleted uranium and 
other unconventional weapons was a blatant act of environmental racism that 
had also been perpetrated in Guam, Hawaii, the Philippines and elsewhere.



      Citing Amnesty International, she said the Navy had used excessive 
force against peaceful demonstrators.  Members of the Navy had fired upon 
them using mace, rubber bullets and other projectiles, as well as subjecting 
them to humiliating physical searches.  The Association condemned the 
politically imperialistic nature of the excessive sentences imposed on the 
demonstrators, who had acted according to moral dictates.  It was essential 
that President Bush free all Puerto Rican prisoners serving long sentences 
related to their country's independence struggle.



      The representative of Venezuela expressed support for the process of 
decolonization, particularly the right of the people of Puerto Rico to 
exercise their right to self-determination.  She urged the Committee to 
adopt by consensus the draft text before it, which embodied in a balanced 
form the main components of the issue.



      The representative of Iraq hoped the draft resolution would be adopted 
once again by consensus, so that the Committee could reaffirm the right of 
the Puerto Rican people to self-determination.



      Iran�s representative fully supported the content of the draft 
resolution and believed its adoption by consensus, demonstrated the 
Committee�s support of the right to self-determination of the Puerto Rican 
people.



      The Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote.



      The representative of Chile said that he had gone along with the 
resolution in order to ensure a consensus.  However, that should not be 
interpreted as support for every point in the text.  Other views existed in 
Puerto Rico which were not represented in the text.  He welcomed the 
expressed intention of the President of the United States to end military 
manoeuvres in Vieques by 2003 and remained convinced that the achievement of 
a satisfactory resolution of the matter would require a decision taken by 
Puerto Rico and the United States.



      Cuba�s representative said that for the third consecutive year the 
Committee had adopted a resolution on Puerto Rico, which represented the 
common position that had developed on the issue.  Once again, the Committee 
had fulfilled its mandate and heeded the calls for action made by the people 
of Puerto Rico. However, the role of the Committee could not end with the 
adoption of the text, and further efforts were required to implement the 
resolution and transform it into a practical tool.



Today, he added, a large number of petitioners were heard, the majority of 
whom had voiced the concerns of the people of Puerto Rico.  He hoped that it 
had also been useful for the United States delegation.  It was his hope that 
the adoption of the text could pave the way for achieving significant 
progress towards the exercise of true self-determination, the inalienable 
right of the people of Puerto Rico.

<pre>DECOLONIZATION COMMITTEE URGES UNITED STATES TO HALT MILITARY MANOEUVRES
ON VIEQUES ISLAND, RETURN OCCUPIED LAND TO PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO



Acting without a Vote, Committee Also Calls
For Expedited Process to Allow Puerto Rican Self-Determination




      Bearing in mind that an official referendum held last July showed an 
overwhelming majority in favour of an immediate, permanent halt to military 
manoeuvres on Vieques, the Special Committee on Decolonization this 
afternoon urged the United States to immediate halt such military 
activities, as it approved a draft resolution on Puerto Rico.



Approving the text without a vote, the Special Committee also urged the 
United States to:  return the occupied land to the people of Puerto Rico; 
halt the persecutions, incarcerations, arrests and harassment of peaceful 
demonstrators; immediately release all persons incarcerated in this 
connection; respect the fundamental human rights of health and economic 
development; and decontaminate the impact areas.



      The Special Committee also called on the United States to assume its 
responsibility for expediting a process that would allow the Puerto Rican 
people fully to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and 
independence.  It further requested the President of the United States to 
release all Puerto Rican political prisoners serving sentences in United 
States prisons for cases related to the struggle for Puerto Rico�s 
independence.



      The representative of Cuba introduced the draft resolution.



More than 20 petitioners addressed the Special Committee during its 
consideration of Puerto Rico which began this morning, and a number of 
petitioners then emphasized the refusal by the United States to respect the 
outcome of last July�s referendum and its continued bombing exercises.  
Speakers also stressed the health hazards, environmental destruction and 
economic strangulation resulting from more than 60 years of bombings by the 
United States Navy.



In addition, whether they supported independence for Puerto Rico or full 
statehood within the United States, speakers agreed on the need to carry out 
the decolonization of Puerto Rico and for the island�s people to determine 
their future political status.  Although commonwealth status had its 
sympathizers, said one speaker, it would not eliminate the colonial 
condition but only perpetuate it.

5th and 6th Meetings (AM &amp; PM)





Another speaker said the refusal by the United States to accept or follow 
through on the conclusions arising from the referendum was a flagrant 
violation of the right to self-determination.  Both the referendum and the 
recognition of the need for a constitutional assembly were important 
additions to the draft resolution and would put pressure on those in Puerto 
Rico and the United States who wished to perpetuate colonialism.



      Statements were made by the representatives of Colegio de Abogados de 
Puerto Rico; Frente Socialista; Causa Com�n Independentista (Proyecto 
Educativo Puertorrique�o); Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico; San Romero 
de las Americas Church; Puerto Rican Independence Party; Committee for the

Party; and American Association of Jurists.



      Also making statements were the representatives of Venezuela, Iraq, 
Iran and Chile.

Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the 
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and 
Peoples -� will be announced.

      Background



      The Special Committee on Decolonization met this morning to consider 
the question of Puerto Rico.  It had before it draft resolution submitted by 
Cuba on the Special Committee decision of 21 July 2001 concerning Puerto 
Rico (document A/AC.109/2002/L.8), by which the Special Committee would urge 
the United States to:  order an immediate halt to its armed forces� military 
drills and manoeuvres on Vieques Island, which is inhabited; return the 
occupied land to the people of Puerto Rico; halt the persecutions, 
incarcerations, arrests and harassment of peaceful demonstrators; 
immediately release all persons incarcerated in this connection; respect 
fundamental human rights, such as the right to health and economic 
development; and decontaminate the impact areas.



      The Committee would also call on the United States to assume its 
responsibility of expediting a process that will allow the Puerto Rican 
people to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and 
independence, in conformity with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and 
the resolutions and decisions of the Special Committee concerning Puerto 
Rico.  Also, the Committee would request the President of the United States 
to release all Puerto Rican political prisoners serving sentences in United 
States prisons for cases related to the struggle for Puerto Rico�s 
independence.



The Committee also had before it a report prepared by its Rapporteur, 
Fayssal Mekdad (Syria) (document A/AC.109/2002/L.4), on the Committee�s 
decision of 22 June 2001 concerning Puerto Rico, which considers the 
question of Puerto Rico in the light of previous reports, recent political 
developments in Puerto Rico, action taken by United Nations bodies on the 
question and the views of the parties concerned.  Annexed to the report is a 
list of organizations contacted to provide updated information on 
self-determination and independence with respect to Puerto Rico.



Also before the Committee were requests for hearing, contained in 
aides-m�moire 8/02/Add.1 to 10/02.



      Statements



      JAIME RUBERTE, Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, said that last year 
he had explained the problem regarding the death penalty, which could be 
applied under federal law, although it was prohibited by Puerto Rico.  It 
was both humiliating and unjust that Puerto Ricans could not try our their 
own citizens on their own territory.



He said that last year a referendum was held on Vieques.  The overwhelming 
majority had voted for a cessation of United States bombings and a clean-up 
of contaminated areas.  The United States did not respect the result of that 
referendum and continued to carry out bombing exercises.  He also referred 
to the abuses carried out by the United States in relation to Vieques.  The 
situation there had remained the same or worsened with regard to detainment.



      On the political situation, he said that Puerto Rico had adopted a 
resolution to carry out a study on the establishment of a constitutional 
assembly.  The Government had decided to appoint a body to determine the 
status of Puerto Rico.  It adopted a resolution in October 2001, which, 
among other things, recognized that the United States had not adopted a 
decolonization policy.  The people of Puerto Rico had wanted a 
constitutional assembly to determine their own legal status and discuss 
their own sovereignty.  That assembly represented the political will of the 
people and it would sit independently of the United States with the election 
of delegates.



He urged Puerto Rico�s Legislative Assembly to adopt a policy regarding that 
assembly.  The College of Lawyers felt that the assembly was brought 
together to draft a constitution and would support that process.  Also, he 
endorsed the adoption of the draft resolution before the Committee.



      JORGE FARINACCI GARCIA, Frente Socialista, noting that the Government 
of the United States had maintained a colonial regime in Puerto Rico since 
1898, said that since last summer the Puerto Rican people's resistance 
against Navy exercises had led to more than 2,000 people being charged in 
federal court.  Dozens had been incarcerated for defending Vieques and many 
more had been tried.  The matter was still unresolved, owing to the 
stubbornness of the United States Government.



He said there had been more than a century of mistreatment and abuse of the 
Puerto Rican people by the various branches of the United States military 
and by companies established in the territory.  The United States Government 
now wanted to establish the death penalty, which was banned under Puerto 
Rico's Constitution.  The Puerto Rican people were facing that and numerous 
other examples of colonial subordination.



      However, it was certain that there was a cause that aimed at changing 
the colonial reality existing in Puerto Rico, he said. On the other hand, 
pro-colonial groups were fighting against the clearest evidence of 
colonialism, including corruption and drug-trafficking.  Recent statistical 
studies showed that Puerto Rico had the second highest per capita murder 
rate in the world after Colombia, which was suffering an internal war.  The 
people would accept no less than the right to self-determination, 
independence and the release of political prisoners.  The draft resolution 
should be submitted to the General Assembly as soon as possible.



      CARLOS VIZCARRONDO-IRIZARRY, House of Representatives of Puerto Rico, 
said that in July Puerto Rico would celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of 
its Constitution.  The Puerto Rican constitutional convention, which had 
drafted that document, had also adopted a resolution by which the people of 
Puerto Rico could revise the status of its relationship with the United 
States.  Forty-nine years had gone by during which Puerto Rico and the 
United States had failed in their attempts to resolve the political future 
of Puerto Rico.  Plebiscites had been held and commissions had been 
established, but those efforts had not been successful.



The present Government of Puerto Rico would convene a commission of Puerto 
Rican unity to explore mechanisms to determine Puerto Rico�s course to 
self-determination, he said.  In that regard, it was exploring the idea of 
establishing a constitutional convention to determine the future status of 
Puerto Rico.  He would favour a people�s assembly or constitutional 
convention to determine Puerto Rico�s future.



      The people of Vieques, by a majority of 70 per cent, had stated their 
views through the referendum held last year, he said.  The President of the 
United States had stated that the Navy would leave Vieques by May 2003.  The 
Special Committee should mention the situation in Vieques and call for the 
immediate cessation of military exercises there.  That territory should be 
returned to the people and cleaned up by the United States.  He urged the 
Committee to adopt an expression of Puerto Rico�s natural right to 
self-determination.



      MANUEL GONZALEZ, Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico, said the 
establishment by the United States of the so-called Free Associated State of 
Puerto Rico had long deceived world opinion and some Puerto Ricans.  Like 
every other colony, Puerto Rico had suffered, and only concerted action by 
its people and institutions would make it possible for the territory to 
become a free sovereign and independent nation.  However, time was too short 
to recount the history of Puerto Rico's colonization, or to enumerate the 
ills visited on its people.



He said it was not the time to expand on the hypocrisy of those who claimed 
to be the champions of democracy in the world, while they strangled the 
freedom of the Cuban people and refused to recognize their right to forge 
their own destiny.  In addition, they attempted to suppress the sovereign 
will of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and permitted the massacre of 
the Palestinian people.  Through brutal force they had tried to impose their 
will on all corners of the world.  Puerto Rico must be free and sovereign 
today, he emphasized.



      LUIS BARRIOS, Reverend of the San Romero de las Americas Church, said 
that he was here to denounce the political sin of colonialism committed by 
the United States against Puerto Rico.  The United States had unleashed its 
war against terrorism following 11 September.  While it had identified 
others as supporters of terrorism, their own acts of political terrorism had 
been perpetrated under the cloak of national security.  The United States 
invaded and occupied Puerto Rico in 1898.  In 1917, the United States 
Government imposed United States citizenship on Puerto Rico against the will 
of its people.  Ironically, that was done three weeks before the First World 
War broke out, conferring mandatory military service on the people of Puerto 
Rico.  Then, in 1940, the United States military began military exercises on 
Vieques.



It was necessary to constantly question what was known as elections in 
Puerto Rico, he added.  While they were supposed to be democratic, they were 
conducted by an administration that carried out the policies of the United 
States on the island.  Puerto Rico was still a colony of the United States.  
That sin was still being perpetrated by the United States.  It was necessary 
to begin a process of decolonization and self-determination.  In addition, 
the United States should shoulder its responsibility of restoring economic 
justice in Puerto Rico after  104 years of colonialism.



      FERNANDO MARTIN-GARCIA, Puerto Rican Independence Party, said many 
cynics and sceptics had said that the Committee's resolutions were 
meaningless and could be ignored.  The same had been said of its resolutions 
on East Timor, which had recently gained full independence.  Unexpected 
political changes in Indonesia had created a new circumstance to bring about 
an event that had previously seemed impossible.  That would have been 
impossible without the international community's recognition of East Timor's 
right to self-determination.  Those who underestimated the Organization's 
role in decolonization betrayed an ignorance of history.



      He said the draft resolution before the Committee contained two 
elements that strengthened last year's text.  One involved the demand by 
more than 70 per cent of the Puerto Rican, as expressed in the referendum, 
that the Navy put an end to its bombing exercises on Vieques and clean up 
the island.  The refusal by the United States to accept or follow through on 
those conclusions was a flagrant violation of the right to 
self-determination.  Both last year's referendum and the recognition of the 
need for a constitutional assembly for Puerto Rico were important additions 
to the draft resolution and would put pressure on those in Puerto Rico and 
the United States who wished to perpetuate colonialism.  Yesterday East 
Timor, tomorrow Puerto Rico, he concluded.



      ISMAEL GUADALUPE, Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques, 
said that Vieques was being used as a weapons depository and training camp 
for the United States military.  The Special Committee had determined that 
the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States was colonial in 
nature.



He first wanted to highlight the new violations of human rights against the 
people of Vieques, who had made it clear through a referendum to the Navy 
what it wanted.  Two thirds of the voters on Vieques voted in favour of the 
Navy leaving immediately.  In response, the Navy had unleashed more 
brutality during demonstrations held against it.  Today, the Government of 
Puerto Rico had not called on the Government of the United States to respect 
the will expressed during the referendum.  Also, nothing had been said about 
the fact that death due to cancer had risen in Vieques.



His second point was that it was necessary to put pressure on the United 
States Navy to compensate the inhabitants of Vieques for 60 years of 
destruction.  The presence of the Navy had meant the economic strangulation 
of the people of the island.  Following the Navy�s departure, the clean-up 
of Vieques must begin.  In that connection, he insisted on the following 
four points:  demilitarisation; return of land; decontamination; and 
development.  The Special Committee must denounce United States activity on 
Vieques and support full withdrawal and compensation by the United States.



      EDWIN PAGAN, ProLibertad Freedom Campaign, said the dissolution by the 
United States of its colonial control over Puerto Rico would cause a domino 
effect on other such administering Powers, which would then end their 
control over the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories.  Despite the 
ability of Puerto Ricans to travel between the United States and Puerto Rico 
without a passport, it was still a colonial territory.



He said that, despite the release of some Puerto Rican political prisoners, 
others had been incarcerated for their political beliefs.  Their value and 
efforts were concrete proof of the determination of Puerto Ricans to achieve 
self-determination.  By legislation enacted by the Governor of Puerto Rico 
last July, a referendum had been held in which more than 80.5 per cent of 
the population had participated.  Of those, more than 70 per cent had voted 
that the United States Navy immediately withdraw from Vieques and that it 
clean up the island's beaches.



      Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September, he said, it had become 
clear that the United States Government would use different means to fight 
against international terrorism.  The decisions arising from those tragic 
events had, in turn, rendered obsolete the United States Navy�s need to use 
the beaches of Vieques for its bombing exercises.  In that light, the 
failure by the United States Navy and Government to heed the will of the 
people of Vieques and Puerto Rico could only be described as arrogance.



      JUAN MARI BRAS, on behalf of Causa Com�n Independentista (Proyecto 
Educativo Puertorrique�o), said that the most basic understanding should 
indicate to the United States and the United Nations that the question of 
Puerto Rico needed to be discussed in a forum of greater authority, such as 
the International Court of Justice.  He requested that that the 
recommendation be included in the resolution to be adopted this year.



It was time to overcome the deadlock between the United States and the 
Special Committee, he continued.  That was particularly important this year, 
because the Puerto Rican people were nearing a crucial moment in their 
history.  The old imperialist policy of divide and conquer had begun to 
collapse.  A greater number of organizations and peoples had become 
convinced that it was necessary to overcome inter-Puerto Rican differences 
and call for a mechanism leading to consensus on the path to decolonization. 
  He hoped the resolution would reflect the progress and changes in the 
struggle of the Puerto Rican people.



      BETTY BRASSELL, United for Vieques, Puerto Rico, Inc., said that her 
organization was a group of individuals committed for peace for Vieques.  
Its goal was to create awareness and keep civil society informed about the 
health hazards and the ecological and economic destruction caused by the 
United States Navy on Vieques, as well as to inspire others to actively 
protect their communities.



She had gone to Vieques with a group of people to participate in civil 
disobedience, and found it hard to believe the people there were talking 
about the United States Government and Navy, which was supposedly committed 
to protecting its citizens.  Bombs devastated the environment, destroyed the 
earth and helped to eliminate various species of wildlife.  They were an 
abuse of people and the land.  Could one imagine what bombs did to a small 
island like Vieques?  The United States Navy knew that, but had continued to 
bomb and contaminate the island for more than 61 years.  The international 
community�s voice and indignation was not being clearly heard.  A strong 
statement must be made in the Committee�s deliberations to bring peace to 
Vieques.



      JULIO MURIENTE, Nuevo Movimiento Independentista Puertorique�o, 
congratulating the people and Government of East Timor for their heroic 
achievement of independence, said that in less than two months Puerto Ricans 
would mark the anniversary of the invasion of their country by the United 
States.  While there was no doubt that there was an unresolved political 
problem, there were differences about which path to follow in resolving it.  
The main obstacle was the lack of political will on the part of the United 
States.



Worse was the fact that the Government of the United States refused to 
recognize that there was a colonial problem that had lasted more than a 
century, he said.  It could be seen with ever-greater diversity and breadth 
of scope that there was a need to end bombing exercises on Vieques.  People 
from all political parties had expressed their will in the referendum, in 
which 80 per cent of the voting public had participated.  Almost 70 per cent 
of those had voted for the end to bombing and the withdrawal of the Navy.



The response of the United States to that overwhelming rejection had been to 
resume bombing two weeks later and to imprison the Mayor of Vieques, he 
noted.  Although President George W. Bush had pledged to remove the Navy, 
the great question now remained:  how much will remained among the Puerto 
Ricans regarding the annexation of their country?  Draft laws were being 
promoted in Congress for direct control of rivers, as well as annexation.  
Such proposals threatened the fiscal integrity and resources of the nation.



      HECTOR L. PESQUERA, on behalf of Congreso Nacional Hostosiano, said 
that since the adoption of the Committee�s resolution in July 2001, 
important events had taken place which violated the human rights of the 
people of Puerto Rico.  At present, Vieques fishermen, members of the 
religious community and other civilians were in prison.  Through 
environmental colonialism, the United States Navy was destroying 
archaeological and aquatic sites, carrying out exercises with harmful 
substances.  In addition, before the United States Congress was a draft law, 
which would appropriate more than 100,000 hectares of land in northern 
Puerto Rico.  Also, a draft law, adopted in the House of Representatives, 
would affect three major rivers in Puerto Rico.  That draft was currently 
before the Senate.  He called on the United States to decontaminate more 
than 79 areas, which had been used by the United States military in the past 
and since abandoned.



      The people of Puerto Rico had come up against the federal Government 
in exercising the rights enshrined in the Constitution, which was adopted 50 
years ago, he said.  In the past year there had been constant violations of 
that Constitution by the United States Government.  Among them was the 
imposition of the death penalty in Puerto Rico, which was prohibited by the 
Constitution of Puerto Rico.  First of all, the case of Puerto Rico should 
be included as a separate item on the agenda of the upcoming General 
Assembly.  Second, it should be recognized that the only people that could 
change the Constitution of Puerto Rico were the Puerto Ricans themselves.



Third, he continued, the United States must respect the rules and laws 
established by Puerto Rico in the management and protection of Puerto Rico�s 
natural resources.  He invited the Special Committee to visit Puerto Rico to 
witness the damage caused by military exercises on Vieques.  Fourth, the 
people�s assembly should be involved in the decolonization of Puerto Rico.  
He rejected any proposal to integrate Puerto Rico into the federal system of 
the United States.  Fifth, the United States Government should respect the 
outcome of the referendum conducted in July 2001, which called for the 
immediate withdrawal of the United States military from Vieques.  Sixth, 
amnesty should be granted to all Puerto Ricans involved in the freedom 
struggle for Puerto Rico.



      FRANK VELGARA, Vieques Support Campaign, said the continued bombing on 
Vieques not only represented a clear and present danger to the lives, 
health, social and political well-being of the island's inhabitants, but 
also a direct example of the colonial political control exercised by the 
United States since 1898.  The people were affected by mercury poisoning of 
the air, water, flora and fauna, in addition to continuing to live in a vast 
death trap that could only be described as death on the instalment plan.



      The reality of Puerto Rico exposed the lie of participatory democracy 
claimed by the United States, he said.  Hundreds of people had been arrested 
in Puerto Rico, in the United States and elsewhere for demanding an end to 
bombing and other harmful practices.  The racist treatment of those arrested 
stood clear for the world to see.



Just a few weeks ago, the world had seen an attempt by anti-democracy forces 
to stage a coup in Venezuela, he recalled.  In the past, Vieques had been 
the launch pad and rehearsal site for invasions of the Dominican Republic 
and Grenada.  In Vieques, all Puerto Ricans could see their colonial status, 
as well as the racism and discrimination that had been the lot of all 
nations under colonial domination.  According to a Puerto Rican saying, one 
could not cover the sky with one hand.  In other words, a colony remained so 
under any other name.



      WILFREDO SANTIAGO VALIENTE, United Statehooders Organization of New 
York, Inc., said that self-determination did not necessarily imply 
independence for a group of people.  If the Committee wished to support the 
decolonization of Puerto Rico, it was imperative that any resolution adopted 
by it recognize resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions, which 
endorsed three options for the decolonization of a territory.  The case of 
Puerto Rico brought up the issue of sovereignty, not autonomy.  In 
international law, autonomy referred to political decentralization. On 25 
July, Puerto Rico would celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its 
Constitution.  He wanted a referendum on statehood or independence to 
determine the future status of Puerto Rico.



      ELSIE VALDES, Puertorique�os ante la ONU, Inc., said that, while the 
alternatives of political status had been discussed for several years, it 
should be remembered that Puerto Rico was subject to the territorial laws of 
the United States, whose Congress could unilaterally decide its destiny.  
There was no bilateral pact whatsoever between Puerto Rico and the United 
States.  Puerto Rico was an unincorporated territory, or colony, and had no 
sovereignty.



The United States could have solved the issue of Puerto Rico's political 
status as a domestic matter, but it had not done so, she said.  Likewise, 
the United Nations, where solutions for such matters were presented, had 
also not resolved it.  Only resolutions had been presented.  While her 
organization believed firmly in American citizenship and desired permanent 
union with the United States, it would respect the choice of the majority.



Puerto Rico was a colony and would remain so until a permanent definition 
was established, she emphasized.  The independence movement in the territory 
had only been able to achieve 45 per cent in support for its cause.  
Although commonwealth status had its sympathizers, it would not eliminate 
the colonial condition, but only perpetuate it.  Puerto Ricans had been 
American since 1917, but were prevented from enjoying the same privileges as 
other Americans without losing their identity as a people.



      HAYDEE RIVERA, Puertorique�os Pro Estadidad, Inc., said that her 
organization had called for a resolution of the political problem of Puerto 
Rico though the granting of statehood.  In 1953, representatives of Puerto 
Rico and the United States, before the General Assembly, had stated that 
people of Puerto Rico had exercised their right to self-determination, and a 
resolution had been adopted removing Puerto Rico from the list of 
Non-Self-Governing Territories �- resolution 748 (VIII).  However, the 
people of Puerto Rico had not been allowed to determine their status, as 
called for in resolution 1514.  General Assembly resolution 748 (VIII) had 
never been fully enforced.  The people needed to select one of the options 
outlined in resolution 1514.



Her organization had maintained that statehood would be the most effective 
way of ensuring the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico.  Congress 
should recognize permanent legal status for the island.  Statehood would 
provide for equal participation in the political process.  That was decision 
that should be left up to the Puerto Ricans.



      LUIS VEGA RAMOS, PROELA, said the discussion was taking place in light 
of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the commonwealth's 
Constitution.  While that document reflected the right of future Puerto 
Ricans to decide their political status, claims to greater 
self-determination or autonomy had not been thoroughly heard, and another 
mechanism was required to address that concern.



      He said claims for sovereignty had followed the adoption in 1960 of 
resolutions 1540 and 1541 by the United Nations General Assembly. The claim 
for sovereignty had been reaffirmed in the 2000 elections.  Free association 
was nothing but full autonomy of the commonwealth.  The resolution adopted 
by the Committee in 1978 reaffirmed its right to self-determination and 
sovereignty.



The United States had not complied with the prerequisites of integration or 
the right of accession as contained in resolution 1541, he said.  It was 
because of that lack of right of accession that there had already been a 
civil war in the United States.  The Mayor of Vieques was among hundreds of 
Puerto Ricans imprisoned for demanding an immediate end to bombing and a 
clean-up of the island.  Ending the bombing was a right and should not be a 
subject of negotiations, he said.



      BRUNO RODRIGUEZ PARRILLA (Cuba), introducing the draft resolution on 
Puerto Rico, said that the common history and special relationship between 
Cuba and Puerto Rico could be summed up in the words, �Cuba and Puerto Rico 
were the two wings of the same bird.�  The text before the Committee 
reiterated the basic elements of resolutions previously adopted by Special 
Committee.  Since 1973, resolutions of the Special Committee had reaffirmed 
the inalienable right of



Puerto Ricans to the right to self-determination and the applicability of 
resolution 1514 to Puerto Rico.  After more than 100 years of political 
domination and military occupation, Puerto Ricans had shown their 
determination to maintain their distinct cultural identity.



A consensus existed among Puerto Ricans to put an end to the situation in 
Vieques, he noted.  According to environmental studies, it would take 
decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to clean the areas affected by 
the bombings.  New sections of text drew attention to the referendum held 
last July regarding United States withdrawal from Vieques and requested the 
United States President to release Puerto Rican political prisoners.  He 
called on the Committee to adopt the text by consensus.



      NELSON CANALS, Gran Oriente Nacional de Puerto Rico, paying tribute to 
the people of East Timor on the occasion of their independence, said his 
organization had been appearing before the Special Committee since 1972. 
Successive generations of Puerto Ricans had committed themselves to 
achieving social and economic freedom, as a result of which many were now 
held in United States prisons.



Freedom fighters had been forced to go into hiding or flee their homeland to 
escape oppression, he said.  Their right to return must be guaranteed.  
Puerto Rican determination to end repression had most recently been made 
clear through the tenacious resistance to the military operations on 
Vieques.  That had led to the arrest of protestors and their sentencing to 
disproportionate jail sentences.



Noting that the Puerto Rican legislature had repealed the death penalty 
since 1929, he said it remained banned under the 1952 Constitution.  
Attempts to introduce that barbaric measure was another flagrant violation 
of Puerto Rican sovereignty.  Gran Oriente denounced such attempts and hoped 
the Special Committee would take action to end the situation in Puerto Rico, 
the world's oldest colony.



      ANITA VELEZ MITCHELL, Primavera, Inc., said that she was born in 
Vieques.  As a child, she was witness to the agrarian fall of Vieques.  The 
United States naval base might finally leave the island in 2003.  Puerto 
Ricans were now going through an identity crisis.  Eight hundred Puerto 
Ricans perished on 11 September.  However, they were counted among the 
Hispanics.  When they were called to war, they were identified as Americans. 
  After the hideous attack in Central Park, they were labelled as Puerto 
Ricans, even though there was only one Puerto Rican in that group of men, 
that too a �New Yorican�.  The idea was to find a way to recover the dignity 
of the people of Puerto Rico.



      JOSE ADAMES, Al Frente, said that despite being one of the best 
democracies in the world, United States history was filled with 
discrimination.  Even some map makers did not include Puerto Rico in the 
maps of the United States.  Puerto Rico was a victim of discrimination in 
many ways.  It became a territory of the United States before some States of 
the Union.  Its Government was equal to that of any other State of the 
United States.



Puerto Rico, he said, should have received statehood.  It had more United 
States citizens than some American States.  Puerto Rico was a State of the 
United States in every way.  Puerto Rican soldiers and police had given 
their life for the United States.  He called on the President of the United 
States to put a stop to that historical insult by submitting a declaration 
of statehood to the United States Congress.



      NILDA LUZ REXACH, National Advancement for Puerto Rican Culture, 
stressed that there was no moral or legal principle that could justify 
leaving more than

3 million people without self-determination.  The disenfranchised Puerto 
Rican people included thousands who had given their lives in American wars, 
and yet they had no right to political representation in the United States.  
There was no legal definition for the former and present status of Puerto 
Rico, which was neither free nor associated.



She said it had long been clear that the Constitution of the United States 
would supersede the will of the Puerto Rican people on any occasion.  Puerto 
Rican culture remained the same mixed culture that had always existed on the 
island, yet English was now being imposed on the territory.  Full statehood 
was the only solution, she stressed.



The Special Committee must not be misled by clever manipulation of the 
Vieques issue, she cautioned.  That situation was the fault of inaction by 
Congress, which had failed to safeguard health, peace and order on the 
island.   In addition, the people of Puerto Rico demanded that President 
George W. Bush   end historical discrimination against the Puerto Rican 
people, who fully deserved the status of American citizens of the union's 
fifty-first State.



      ROGER CALERO, Socialist Workers Party, demanded the immediate 
withdrawal of the United States Navy from Vieques and the release of all 
those imprisoned in that regard.  A successful struggle for independence was 
in the interest of not only the Puerto Ricans, but also the people of the 
United States.  It would show that it was possible to stand up to the mighty 
power of the United States.  For more than a century, the United States had 
maintained Puerto Rico as its colony, a fact which it had unsuccessfully 
tried to cover up.  Today, the United States was turning to its military 
might to impose its power.  The establishment of a United States-dominated 
protectorate in Afghanistan exposed that Washington�s so-called war on 
terror was just a war on other peoples and nations.



Today, he said, there were still five Puerto Rican political prisoners 
detained in the United States, due to their ideas and actions with regard to 
Puerto Rico�s independence.  He joined others in demanding their immediate 
release.  Puerto Ricans in the United States represented a significant 
portion of the country�s workforce.  Since Washington invaded Puerto Rico 
over a century ago, it had been used as a launching pad for military action 
against other countries, such as Grenada.  The militarization of Puerto Rico 
reinforced the United States� intention to establish military bases in other 
Latin American countries.



      VANESSA RAMOS, American Association of Jurists, said that the word 
"American" in her organization's name sought to embrace all countries of the 
Americas, with the understanding that many of the conflicts had been the 
result of intervention by the United States.  The Association defended the 
right of the Puerto Rican people to self-determination and independence.



      She reaffirmed that the United States Navy must immediately and 
unconditionally stop its military activities and dismantle all warlike 
equipment



stored on Vieques.  The Navy's experimentation with depleted uranium and 
other unconventional weapons was a blatant act of environmental racism that 
had also been perpetrated in Guam, Hawaii, the Philippines and elsewhere.



      Citing Amnesty International, she said the Navy had used excessive 
force against peaceful demonstrators.  Members of the Navy had fired upon 
them using mace, rubber bullets and other projectiles, as well as subjecting 
them to humiliating physical searches.  The Association condemned the 
politically imperialistic nature of the excessive sentences imposed on the 
demonstrators, who had acted according to moral dictates.  It was essential 
that President Bush free all Puerto Rican prisoners serving long sentences 
related to their country's independence struggle.



      The representative of Venezuela expressed support for the process of 
decolonization, particularly the right of the people of Puerto Rico to 
exercise their right to self-determination.  She urged the Committee to 
adopt by consensus the draft text before it, which embodied in a balanced 
form the main components of the issue.



      The representative of Iraq hoped the draft resolution would be adopted 
once again by consensus, so that the Committee could reaffirm the right of 
the Puerto Rican people to self-determination.



      Iran�s representative fully supported the content of the draft 
resolution and believed its adoption by consensus, demonstrated the 
Committee�s support of the right to self-determination of the Puerto Rican 
people.



      The Committee adopted the draft resolution without a vote.



      The representative of Chile said that he had gone along with the 
resolution in order to ensure a consensus.  However, that should not be 
interpreted as support for every point in the text.  Other views existed in 
Puerto Rico which were not represented in the text.  He welcomed the 
expressed intention of the President of the United States to end military 
manoeuvres in Vieques by 2003 and remained convinced that the achievement of 
a satisfactory resolution of the matter would require a decision taken by 
Puerto Rico and the United States.



      Cuba�s representative said that for the third consecutive year the 
Committee had adopted a resolution on Puerto Rico, which represented the 
common position that had developed on the issue.  Once again, the Committee 
had fulfilled its mandate and heeded the calls for action made by the people 
of Puerto Rico. However, the role of the Committee could not end with the 
adoption of the text, and further efforts were required to implement the 
resolution and transform it into a practical tool.



Today, he added, a large number of petitioners were heard, the majority of 
whom had voiced the concerns of the people of Puerto Rico.  He hoped that it 
had also been useful for the United States delegation.  It was his hope that 
the adoption of the text could pave the way for achieving significant 
progress towards the exercise of true self-determination, the inalienable 
right of the people of Puerto Rico.

Press Release
Jose Solis Jordan, Puerto Rican political prisoner, has informed us today at 
7:30 this morning that he has been placed in yet another jail while "in 
transit", this time in Oklahoma. From May 21 until Monday, June 3 he was in 
Atlanta.  The conditions in which he found himself in Atlanta were inhuman: 
he was put in solitary confinement (or "the hole" as it is known)in an area 
that dates back to 1902.  He barely ate or slept.  He was isolated from the 
general prison population in an action that not even the jail guards could 
understand because his papers all indicated that Jose was supposed to be 
going to a "half-way house" in Puerto Rico, which is a minimum security 
unit. Now in Oklahoma the conditions are better but he continues to be 
without much communication and has not arrived in his homeland, Puerto Rico.

All this absurd "transit" to which Solis is being subjected, can only be 
understood if we examine the facts:  Jose Solis has remained firm inhis 
convictions; he has not "cooperated" with the FBI as they want (so that they 
can fabricade cases against other innocent people who are pro-independence 
activists)and has not lost his sensibilities or compassion yet, even, 
towards his oppressors.

This has been the trayectory/history of this companero during his three (3) 
years and three (3) months of imprisonment.  At this moment and ironically, 
he can not every communicate by telephone with his wife, nor his sisters and 
the calls are returned. Why? He has only been able to speak to his parents 
and to my family and during very restricted times.

We demand that the block they put on calls to his family be ended and that 
Jose Solis be sent to Puerto Rico immediately, where he is supposed to be: 
in a federal building, but in his HOMELAND.  Jose was accused without 
EVIDENCE, of conspiracy and he was arreted in 1997.  Later in a trial that 
lasted two (2) weeks, the verdict was guilty WITHOUT EVIDENCE and because of 
the false testimony and lies which were expose din court by an FBI informant 
by the name of Rafael Marrero an agent provocateur&gt;  Since the verdict on 
March 12, 1999, until now he has been encarcerated and have been mistreated, 
he has been lied to and has even made "dubious" and "bogus" offers.  The 
companero has a true boricua spirit: his nobility and strength, like his 
friends and fmaily have been his best weapons.

PLEASE SUPPORT OUR POLITICIAL PRISONERS

BRING JALIL MUNTAQIM HOME!

The NY Post has initiated an attack against political prisoner Jalil 
Muntaqim (Anthony Bottom), who appears before the NY State Parole Board this 
July for the first time, after spending 30 years in prison. Jalil Muntaqim 
is a former member of the Black Panther Party whose conviction occurred 
during the FBI's counterintelligence program, COINTELPRO.  The stated goal 
of COINTELPRO was to neutralize leaders and organizations in the Black 
liberation movement of the 60s and early 70s. The Post is organizing an 
anti-Jalil (and anti-Black liberation struggle) campaign they call "Keep 
Jalil on Ice" by urging people to write to the parole board opposing Jalil's 
release on parole.

Please compose a short message supporting Jalil's release and mail it to:

New York State Taskforce on Political Prisoners

c/o Malcolm X Grassroots Movement

1195 Bedford Avenue

Brooklyn, NY 11216.



Or send an email to; freedomnow2002@...



We will gather as many messages of support as we can and send them to the 
Parole Board in time for Jalil's appearance, so that we can counter the 
Post's racist and vicious campaign.



Sample message:

Jalil Muntaqim has served his time in prison and deserves release on parole. 
I am well aware of the convictions for which he is serving time and of the 
political circumstances surrounding those convictions. Mr. Muntaqim has 
spent his years in prison in a constructive and peaceful manner. He is a 
respected and valued member of his community. As a member of that community, 
I fully support his request for parole.

Signed,

Name, City, State, email

If you want more information about Jalil Muntaqim, call 718.622.8292.

BRING JALIL MUNTAQIM HOME!

The NY Post has initiated an attack against political prisoner Jalil 
Muntaqim (Anthony Bottom), who appears before the NY State Parole Board this 
July for the first time, after spending 30 years in prison. Jalil Muntaqim 
is a former member of the Black Panther Party whose conviction occurred 
during the FBI's counterintelligence program, COINTELPRO.  The stated goal 
of COINTELPRO was to neutralize leaders and organizations in the Black 
liberation movement of the 60s and early 70s. The Post is organizing an 
anti-Jalil (and anti-Black liberation struggle) campaign they call "Keep 
Jalil on Ice" by urging people to write to the parole board opposing Jalil's 
release on parole.

Please compose a short message supporting Jalil's release and mail it to:

New York State Taskforce on Political Prisoners

c/o Malcolm X Grassroots Movement

1195 Bedford Avenue

Brooklyn, NY 11216.



Or send an email to; freedomnow2002@...



We will gather as many messages of support as we can and send them to the 
Parole Board in time for Jalil's appearance, so that we can counter the 
Post's racist and vicious campaign.



Sample message:

Jalil Muntaqim has served his time in prison and deserves release on parole. 
I am well aware of the convictions for which he is serving time and of the 
political circumstances surrounding those convictions. Mr. Muntaqim has 
spent his years in prison in a constructive and peaceful manner. He is a 
respected and valued member of his community. As a member of that community, 
I fully support his request for parole.

Signed,

Name, City, State, email

If you want more information about Jalil Muntaqim, call 718.622.8292.

<pre>Joe- How come in all the hours that I saw you in Newark before the election 
&amp; after you never bothered asking about the paper?  &amp; As usual, only to read 
more emails bantering about issues that only show you haven't really 
bothered to find out the deal.  To save you the trouble, an election issue 
was done, printed &amp; released, then pulled for reasons I'm not going into 
with you here.  If we do an issue covering New Brunswick, it probably won't 
help your ticket (whose mayoral candidate is a police sgt/Pat Buchanon fan 
who threatened Keith Thomas at his work).  In any case, you do a disservice 
not to explain what's behind your litte pokes at me (which are as strangely 
motivated as ever):  For the record, my position was/is that the left in NB 
is split &amp; running two competing tickets, so that the challenge to the 
machine is over before it starts (unless one bows out).  Your criticism of 
the other ticket as a "private club" doesn't resolve this main 
contradiction.  It was barely interesting to hear you explain why they are 
not worth uniting with because they aren't a left-wing political group, but 
that's about all.  Next time you're around, why not talk to me face-to-face 
without running out the door, cause I'm not going to go back and forth about 
this too much on email.  Peace, Matt

amiri,

first - what self-criticism does the committee to elect baraka offer about 
losing this campaign?

will there be an issue of u&amp;s for the new brunswick election?
the election day is nov5 and we would like to begin distribution as soon as 
possible.

it seems that u&amp;s still hides from election issues.
&amp; it is apparent that the forces that sabotaged production in previous years 
have a stronger
relationship to the edit board than before.

also you should discuss w/the edit board, specifically matthew, that a 
private club
is not a left-wing political force capable of united the people. -jsmith



&gt;From: Amirib@...

&gt;Committee to Elect Ras Baraka
&gt;
&gt;������Announces a Press Conference to be held Tues, June 18, 12 :00Am, On 
&gt;The
&gt;Steps Of City Hall, Broad St. Newark.
&gt;������The Press conference, at which Mr Baraka will speak, will formally
&gt;explain the formal request through the courts, of the Run-Off Election for
&gt;City Council, the results of which, according to Newark City Clerk's 
&gt;Office,
&gt;claimed
&gt;Ras Baraka finished fifth in the Council-at-Large race by 114 votes, 84 of
&gt;which were absentee ballots.
&gt;������The closeness of the alleged finish, plus other reported
&gt;irregularities, such as non-functioning election machines, affidavits being
&gt;sworn of officials at some polling places giving false directions denying
&gt;citizens the right to vote, late opening polling places. Plus a variety of
&gt;other reported obstructions to the democratic process make it obligatory 
&gt;that
&gt;there be a recount of the ballots.
&gt;������Certainly the travesty of the National Elections as manifested in the
&gt;obviously less than honest election process in Florida which �resulted in 
&gt;the
&gt;taking of the white house by George W. Bush, demands such safeguards
&gt;to the democratic process.

to get a letter printed so i understand.]


Hello all,
The New Brunswick Peoples Campaign is running a ticket for our local 
municipal election Nov.5, 2002.
The Elected Board of Education ballot question will again lead the 
democratic struggle of this year's campaign. Along with this ballot question 
the Peoples Campaign will run James Neal, an Afro-American male, for mayor &amp; 
Danny Rosado, a Dominican-American women, along with Joe Smith, a 
Euro-American male, for city council. This ticket, while representing the 
multi-cultural democratic development of New Brunswick's future, seeks to 
unite with all progressive people &amp; organizations throughout the New Jersey 
area.

The Peoples Campaign is an open to the public, independent political 
campaign that is focused on organizing our city's people to democratically 
control &amp; run our city's institutions. In campaigns that the peoples 
independent political forces cannot win, it is our stategy to waste the 
Republicans. As a result of the theft of our National Election 2000, Bush's 
illegal administration &amp; the Republican Party as a whole must be exposed &amp; 
attacked by all people as an institution that cripples democracy - locally, 
nationally, &amp; internationally. The Peoples Campaign's stategy is "to Defend 
the Democratic Process, to Defeat the Democratic Party, &amp; Destroy the 
Republican Party."

Of our main issues for democracy in the NB community is the struggle for 
voting rights for all residents who pay taxes. Currently, half of NB 
residents are immigrants from Central/South America &amp; these people are 
completely disenfranchised by the government. Outside of a few token 
positions and backwards spokespersons the NB Latino/a population has no 
representation in city affairs. The NBPC's objective is to change this 
through massive outreach efforts &amp; tireless grass-roots work. The voting 
rights struggle historically is the most victorious struggle of the people &amp; 
in our cities it is the basis for the immigrant community  to develop the 
democratic rights of employment, affordable housing, a living wage, 
healthcare, childcare, quality education and the right to safely practice 
their culture.

The New Brunswick Peoples Campaign recognizes that citizenship, convict, &amp; 
age requirements for voting rob people of participating in the democratic 
development of their lives &amp; community. We are organizing a voter 
registration &amp; voter rights rally this saturday (today) @4pm beginning on 
the corner of Remsen Ave &amp; Suydam St. We will take our positions to the 
people most affected by the lack of democracy in New Brunswick.

All who can attend Saturday (today) please do so &amp; any that can support NBPC 
in other ways contact me -
NBPC encourages new membership, creative ideas, &amp; all criticism from the 
basis of unity.

nations.
NBPC does not back the illegal Bush2 administration in its effort to destroy 
the current Iraqi regime.
Our practical effort of supporting the Iraqi people is our local campaign 
for democracy here in New Brunswick - struggling for community control over 
all city institutions &amp; voting rights for all residents who pay taxes, ie. 
the struggle for self-determination for NB multi-cultural communities.

Bush Officials Differ on Way to Force Out Iraqi Leader

While Bush administration officials agree that options short
of war against Iraq should be tried soon, many disagree
over how to proceed if those plans fail.

in their struggle with the NB Administration. NBPC must point out that 
because the board of education
in NB is appointed by Mayor James Cahill, the community must hold Cahill 
along w/superintendent Larkin completely responsible for this issue. And for 
these two male, white city officials to stand in the way of a latin-american 
young woman from speaking in her native tongue to her fellow peoples 
demonstrates the
complete backwardness of the NB city administration.

With a hispanic population of 65% at NBHS, Angela Salazar must be supported 
in all her struggles to reach out to these young people. SHE HAS EARNED THE 
RIGHT! &amp; now this right must be defended against
what is being dubbed "the tradition" of previous years. Well, the NBPC wants 
to ask Mayor Cahill who's tradition &amp; how this tradition began? We are not 
blind to the similar position of white supremacists about flying the RACIST 
confederate flag as "heritage". So what we are faced with is the 
question/struggle of... Should  the "tradition/heritage" of white, male 
supremacy continue to silence the native tongue of our people &amp; our 
communities?

After reading yesterday's paper &amp; watching the news is encouraging to see 
that the Salazar family
is a family that recognizes the need to fight a "tradition" being imposed on 
their oldest daughter, Angela,
&amp; her entire graduating, class by male, white officials from the NB city 
machine. The NBPC will stand shoulder to shoulder with the family Salazar &amp; 
all families/peoples/organizations throughout the community being 
disenfranchised by our menacing city administration.

The New Brunswick Peoples Campaign is poised to defeat this backwards, 
anti-people Political Machine
in Nov. NBPC maintains the strongest opposition to this city machine, which 
has not lost an election in over 40 years.  We seek to unite with all 
organizations &amp; peoples to strengthen the struggle for peoples democracy in 
New Brunswick.

Running 3 council candidates &amp; the Elected Board of Education ballot 
question in the 2000 election, NBPC is now just five months from winning the 
mayor &amp; 2 council seats.

(results of the '00 campaigns:
          2994 yes votes for an elected school board vs. 3997 no votes
          2100 votes for 3 opposition city council candidates vs. 5100 votes 
for the incumbents)

&gt; &gt;An open letter to the administration of NJIT and Newark City officials:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;NJIT, Newark, and the State officials of New Jersey would do well to
&gt; &gt;remember the Rutgers University/Francis Lawrence (formerly of Louisianna)
&gt; &gt;travesty when considering their position on the appointment of Robert
&gt; &gt;Altenkirch (of Mississippi). The disastrous Lawrence ordeal is remarkably
&gt; &gt;similar to the can of worms currently cracking open at our leading
&gt; &gt;technical college, NJIT.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;NJIT is setting a frightening precedent by agreeing that while dean of an
&gt; &gt;institution, Robert Altenkirch was not responsible for the discrimination
&gt; &gt;levied againts a member of his staff. University deans and central
&gt; &gt;administrations set the current for their entire insitutions, as is
&gt; &gt;evidenced by the bigoted and troubled legacy of Fran Lawrence, former RU
&gt; &gt;president, and the impact his discriminatory remarks and actions had on
&gt; &gt;Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In addition, NJIT is setting an even more frightening precedent that it
&gt; &gt;will silence the voice of decent on its campus and harrass students who
&gt; &gt;speak out for what they beleive by threatening them with unconstitutional
&gt; &gt;lawsuits. Matthew Smith ought to be commended for his relentless 
&gt;dedication
&gt; &gt;to the interests of the people of Newark and the students of NJIT, not
&gt; &gt;condemned and harassed by NJIT administrators for pointing to a rather 
&gt;ugly
&gt; &gt;elephant in their boardroom.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As a state university receiving our money, NJIT is part of the broader
&gt; &gt;public society and is duty-bound to the will of the people.  It must do
&gt; &gt;more to serve the public, like institutionalizing education developmental
&gt; &gt;programs for Newark's youth (a position supported by Smith and his
&gt; &gt;colleagues).  Additionally, it must be less beholden to the
&gt; &gt;corporate sector, to which Altenkirch has publicly declared his 
&gt;allegiance.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;NJIT and all concerned - please don't bring us another Fran Lawrence. 
&gt;Let's
&gt; &gt;concentrate on strengthening New Jersey's education system, not weakening
&gt; &gt;it further.

Subject:letter to the editor<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello all, The New Brunswick Peoples Campaign is running a ticket for our 
local
municipal election Nov.5, 2002. The question of democracy is the focus of
our campaign.
The Peoples Campaign will run James Neal, an Afro-American male, for mayor &amp;
Danny Rosado, a Dominican-American women, along with Joe Smith, a
Euro-American male, for city council. This ticket, while representing the
multi-cultural democratic development of New Brunswick's future, seeks to
unite with all progressive forces &amp; organizations throughout the New Jersey
area.

The Peoples Campaign is an open to the public, independent political
campaign that is focused on organizing our city's people to democratically
control &amp; run our city's institutions. In campaigns that the peoples
independent political forces cannot win, it is our stategy to waste the
Republicans. As a result of the theft of our National Election 2000, Bush's
illegal administration must be called out. When you steal everything you 
have,
&amp; you have the presidentcy you become a criminal &amp; terrorist to the nation's 
people
The ambush as a whole must be exposed &amp; attacked by all people as an 
institution that
cripples democracy - locally,nationally, &amp; internationally.
NBPC agrees with the stategy to Defend the Democratic Process,
to Defeat the Democratic Party, &amp; Destroy the Republican Party.

Of our main issues for democracy in the NB community is the struggle for
voting rights for all residents who pay taxes. Currently, half of NB
residents are immigrants from Central/South America &amp; these people are
completely disenfranchised by the government. We also see that the immigrant
population has no representation in city government. There is oppression in 
this.

The NBPC's objective is to change this through massive outreach efforts
&amp; tireless grass-roots work. The voting rights struggle historically is the 
most
victorious struggle of our people &amp; in our cities it is the basis for the
people struggle� to develop the democratic rights of employment,
affordable housing, a living wage, healthcare, childcare, quality education
and the right to safely practice their culture.

Of course racists political machines should stop thinking it is ok to
superexploit our immigrants brothers &amp; sisters, but here in New Brunswick
it is our life. Reperations are owed to the people locally, nationally, 
internationally.

The New Brunswick Peoples Campaign recognizes that citizenship, convict, &amp;
age requirements for voting rob people of participating in the democratic
development of their lives &amp; community. We are organizing. Please contact
nbpc_2002@... for membership, creative ideas, &amp; all criticism from 
the
basis of unity.

Joe Smith - New Brunswick Council Candidate Nov5, 2002

<pre>Speaking of electoral sabotage, it appears that people like Joe Smith 
(and he's certainly not alone) clumsily screw up their own campaigns 
and messages constantly. Try to be a little diplomatic and tact, Joe. 

As for this year's elections in New Brunswick, the status quo's going 
to remain and the machine's going to win simply because the 
opposition is split and poorly led.

Subject:NYC Council Resolution on Political Prisoners<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign urges folks to forward this message out far 
and wide.

_______________________________________________________________________
Greetings - As you may know, the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement has been 
mobilizing for the release of the NY state political prisoners for some 
time.  This past Thursday NYC council member Charles Barron introduced his 
historic resolution to free political prisoners in NY State.  The result of 
the resolution is the announcing of the first ever NYC Council hearing on 
Political Prisoners.  Therefore, the focus of the press conference has 
shifted from announcing the resolution to announcing the upcoming hearing.  
Please use your networks and get as many folks as possible out to support 
this historic endeavor.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

June 24, 2002
On Thursday June 20 New York City Councilman Charles Barron introduced NYC 
Council resolution # 344

..."calling upon the Governor to Grant clemency to all Political Prisoners 
in the State of New York who have been persecuted and unjustly convicted for 
their political beliefs and activities."
On Wednesday June 26th, Councilman Barron will hold a press conference on 
the steps of City Hall at 12 Noon announcing the historic upcoming hearing 
before the NY City Council committee on Fire and Criminal Justice.  This 
hearing will examine at length the impact of the Counter Intelligence 
Program (Cointelpro), Newkill and other such efforts on communities of 
color, political activists and their families.  This will mark the first 
time in the history of NY State that legislative bodies will officially hold 
a hearing concerning the victims of Cointelpro.

This event is coming on the eve of parole hearings for political prisoners 
Jalil Muntaqim (NY State prison), Robert Seth Hayes (NY State prison), and 
Mutulu Shakur (Federal prison), life-long activists who have been struggling 
for Human Rights for decades.  Members of the families of political 
prisoners are expected to make statements requesting support for the release 
of their loved ones.

At a similar press conference from the steps of City Hall almost a month 
ago, Councilman Barron announced he would formally present this resolution 
on June 26th to the city council for its approval.  State Assemblyman Roger 
Green also announced at that same press conference that he would be 
sponsoring a similar resolution before the State Assembly in Albany.

For further information on the parole campaigns, contact the Malcolm X 
Grassroots Movement at 718.622.8292.

Many of the people stepping forward in this struggle are working mothers.
Current NBPC council candidate Danny Rosado is a mother of 4 &amp; a Wal-Mart 
employee.
Rosado is an immigrant from the Dominican who, after 10 years in the U.S., 
has
gained citizenship. Working 12 hr days, not counting family work, Rosado
is also out organizing people throughout New Brunswick.

Some issues Danny Rosado is out spoken on:

                                             -The Need For A New Brunswick &amp; 
Rutger's Womens' Center
                                               providing a safe/healthy 
environment for women with absolute resources for
                                                 Domestic Violence &amp; 
Battered Women Services
                                                  Sex/Pregnacy Education &amp; 
Abortion Information Access
                                                 always pushing the dialogue 
of Women's History/Present struggle
                                               with a library, arts 
programs, distinguished guests &amp; all creative
                                                expression of women.

                                             - Equal Pay For Equal Work NOW! 
Danny Rosado is fighting this
                                                fight on the local level 
where she can win community support.
                                                It is the women of the New 
Brunswick &amp; Rutger's community that
                                                are making on average $ .70

                                             - The Human Right to a Living 
Wage. Rosado is creating a city
                                                government that will 
evaluate what full-time hourly wage people &amp;
                                                families must have in order

Suits Say Wal-Mart Forces Workers to Toil Off the Clock
June 25, 2002
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE


Legal papers and interviews with Wal-Mart workers suggest
that the company's focus on cost cutting created an
unofficial policy that pressured employees to work unpaid
hours.

2 troopers in 'Pike shooting denied pensions

Published in the Home News Tribune 6/27/02
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

TRENTON -- A pension board denied benefits to two former troopers involved 
in a 1998 shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike that exposed the practice of 
racial profiling.

The State Police Retirement System Board of Trustees voted 4-0 yesterday in 
rejecting the pension requests of John Hogan and James Kenna, said Tom 
Vincz, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, which oversees the 
board.

The board found their guilty pleas disqualified them from receiving 
benefits, Vincz said, noting that "honorable service" is among the pension 
criteria.

Both troopers were seeking pensions by claiming accidental disability, Vincz 
said. Their young ages and relatively brief service made them ineligible to 
apply through other avenues.

Hogan had been a trooper for 6 years and 3 months, while Kenna had served 
for 4 years and 7 months. Their own contributions to the pension fund will 
be returned, Vincz said. Both are in their early 30s.

If their applications had been approved, their annual pensions would have 
equaled two-thirds of their final year's pay, he said.

That would be about $35,000 a year, plus lifelong health benefits. The 
pensions they sought are reserved for troopers who are "permanently 
disabled" by a "traumatic event" while doing their duties, according to 
state police pension guidelines.

Kenna lawyer John D. Arseneault said they were disappointed in the ruling 
and are considering an appeal.

Kenna is now an ironworker.

A message left after business hours for Hogan lawyer Robert L. Galantucci 
was not immediately returned.

In 1998, the troopers fired 11 shots at a van they pulled over for speeding 
on the New Jersey Turnpike. Three of the four minority men in the van were 
wounded.

The incident inflamed accusations that New Jersey State Police targeted 
minority motorists for searches.

Hogan and Kenna pleaded guilty to official misconduct Jan. 14 in a plea deal 
that required them to resign but allowed them to avoid prison. They also 
admitted to providing false information.

They had been charged with aggravated assault; Kenna had also been charged 
with attempted murder.

They will be barred from ever holding jobs as police officers in New Jersey. 
The deal with the state also avoids federal civil-rights charges.

The state paid $12.95 million to the four van occupants to settle their 
lawsuit.

<pre>Situation of Robert Rabin and Hiram Lozada in the Federal Prison,
Guaynabo, PR

On Thursday, July 18 around 6 PM, Prisoners for Peace in Vieques
Robert (Bob) Rabin and Attorney Hiram Lozada, President of the Human
Rights Committee of the Puerto Rico Lawyer's Guild, were transferred -
without any explanation or notice - from Unit 1A (minimum security)
to Unit 1B, which has more restrictions such as limiting visits to
one afternoon per week, only for immediate family members. Rabin has
been denied the right to make telephone calls - not even to his
mother, who resides in Boston. It should be noted that recently these
two men - who are completing sentences of six (Rabin) and four
(Lozada) months for the misdemeanor offence of entering the bombing
range in Vieques to halt the bombing last April - publicly denounced
a series of violations of the prisoners' rights. We call on all who
are committed to peace and human rights to communicate with the
prison, in order to express concern for the well-being of our
prisoners for peace in Vieques. Telephone calls and faxed letters may
be sent to the official in charge of prisoners' issues: Attorney Alma
L�pez, Tel:(787)749-4480; Fax:(787)775-7824.

Situation of Robert Rabin and Hiram Lozada in the Federal Prison,
Guaynabo, PR

On Thursday, July 18 around 6 PM, Prisoners for Peace in Vieques
Robert (Bob) Rabin and Attorney Hiram Lozada, President of the Human
Rights Committee of the Puerto Rico Lawyer's Guild, were transferred -
without any explanation or notice - from Unit 1A (minimum security)
to Unit 1B, which has more restrictions such as limiting visits to
one afternoon per week, only for immediate family members. Rabin has
been denied the right to make telephone calls - not even to his
mother, who resides in Boston. It should be noted that recently these
two men - who are completing sentences of six (Rabin) and four
(Lozada) months for the misdemeanor offence of entering the bombing
range in Vieques to halt the bombing last April - publicly denounced
a series of violations of the prisoners' rights.

We call on all whoare committed to peace and human rights to communicate 
with theprison, in order to express concern for the well-being of 
ourprisoners for peace in Vieques.

Telephone calls and faxed letters maybe sent to the official in charge of 
prisoners' issues: Attorney Alma L�pez, Tel:(787)749-4480; 
Fax:(787)775-7824.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>the trial of new brunswick peoples' campaign city council candidate joseph 
smith and cliff smith against high school principal pierre embrey and board 
of education special security officer donald bowling is scheduled for this 
friday, 9:00 am, in the muncipal courthouse on kirkpatrick st.  it is open 
to the public.

assault charges were filed against each other following a confrontation that 
occured when cliff smith was forcibly removed from the meeting after 
distributing copies of the city school's test scores, which are the lowest 
in middlesex county.

51% of 11th graders passed the hspt, required for graduation.  12% of 
lincoln 4th graders passed their test.

new brunswick's board of education is appointed by mayor cahill.  it is the 
only un-elected school board in the county.  joseph smith, who co-ordinated 
the elected school board referendum in 2000, is running with police officer 
james neal for mayor and danny rosado for city council on the peoples' 
campaign slate.

for info, contact cliff smith 732.214.8828

New Brunswick Peoples� Campaign 2002
unite the many, defeat the few!

Strike Together--First Beat Cahill/J&amp;J�s shill!

The local split between progressive forces will guarantee one thing: victory 
to the backwards rule of J-Cahill, his cohorts, and especially the 
imperialist dictators he represents.   But a truce can, if we do the work, 
bring us to the doorstep of peoples� victory.

The Peoples� Campaign offers to immediately withdraw the candidacy of Joe 
Smith for city council, if it will help advance a united peoples� campaign.  
  This leaves us with 5 candidates for 3 positions, the deadline for ballot 
adjustments being September 12.  If we truly represent the people, we need 
to make moves now.

Informal discussions between members of the campaigns resulted in the 
proposal of a late-August joint, public event centered around mutual 
endorsement of each other�s ballot issues: functioning rent control and an 
elected board of education.  The intent being to bring the two groups to the 
same table in working unity, to strengthen the issues, and to create motion 
toward one democratic campaign, not two.

*Cahill can be expected to draw 5000+ votes in a tight race.
*Factoring the cheat, we must pull 10,000 votes to ensure a win.
*Ras Baraka lost Newark City Council by 114 votes of 9,000.
*Bush2 won(?) tie-breaking Florida by several hundred.
*We cannot afford a close race--it must be all-out!

Lenin said �March separately, strike together!�  Let us also.

<pre>Well, no. I don't think such has anything to do with "watering it down" but 
with a disagrement about the root problem that has to be dealt with.
For example - one can discuss the past 400 years in relation of how they 
have been filled with slavery, violence, and many forms of racist oppresion 
- but it is of utmost importance to discuss why such occurred.
The slave trade, the imperialist domination and confiscation of resource, 
the continuing forms of discrimination, etc . . . are almost entirely 
rationalizations for the power relations of economic conquest and control: 
ie. capitalism. and this way the relation of the plunder of native american 
lands, of the oppression of women, etc . . . are not watering down the cause 
but are all intrinsically linked.

so - to demand reparations, which is completely justified - in a way that 
just reinforces the capitalist and imperialist model which was by and large 
the very cause of much of the suffering, is somewhat counterproductive. 
perhaps I'm just being reductionistic - but, what would the logic be for the 
necessity of repartions for african americans that did not acknowledge the 
brazen exploitation of other groups, even if such was on a much smaller 
scale?

water down the right of the Black Nation to reparations &amp;

we fully w/ yr march, yr demands, a 'movement for/by you', the attack on 
'other groups seeking to atacch themselves to  our struggle', &amp; the 
anticipation of that based on the long history of white opportunism.

if there's anything we can do to promote the march or the cause, please let 
us know.

but for our part, it seems that in the overall, the acknowledgement of all 
oppressions (on the basis of self-determination &amp; equality), strengthens all 
the 'for/by us' movements. no?

but either way, we support yr march &amp; are glad for yr work.

 &gt; you define 'reparations' to me.  my understanding is 'compensation
for a
 &gt; wrong done'.  we tryin to see all wrongs compensated. not in any
way to
 &gt; water down the right of the Black Nation to reparations &amp;

On Thursday, July 18 around 6 PM, Prisoners for Peace in Vieques Robert 
(Bob) Rabin and Attorney Hiram Lozada, President of the Human Rights 
Committee of the Puerto Rico Lawyer's Guild, were transferred - without any 
explanation or notice - from Unit 1A (minimum security) to Unit 1B, which 
has more restrictions such as limiting visits to one afternoon per week, 
only for immediate family members. Rabin has been denied the right to make 
telephone calls - not even to his mother, who resides in Boston. It should 
be noted that recently these two men - who are completing sentences of six 
(Rabin) and four (Lozada) months for the misdemeanor offence of entering the 
bombing range in Vieques to halt the bombing last April - publicly denounced 
a series of violations of the prisoners' rights.

We call on all who are committed to peace and human rights to communicate 
with theprison, in order to express concern for the well-being of our 
prisoners for peace in Vieques.

Telephone calls and faxed letters maybe sent to the official in charge of 
prisoners' issues: Attorney Alma L�pez, Tel:(787)749-4480;

Subject:History of New Brunswick<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Greetings -

My name is Stevphen Shukaitis; I'm beginning work on a people's history of 
New Brunswick. Having read the recent Home-News Tribune supplement 
(�Building a New New Brunswick,� 7/30/02), with its blatantly pro-corporate 
bias and complete lack of discussion or analysis of how development has 
affected the communities and people of New Brunswick, we thought such a 
project would be a good way to get out other sides of the story and share 
information not often circulated in the current media coverage of the 
situation.

If you have information about any of the following topics (or know people 
that do) it would be greatly appreciated if you could forward the
information to me:
-anything to do with changes in communities and the area
-DevCo, CORE, and other redevelopment/gentrification efforts
-police corruption, brutality, and police-community relations
- machine politics, the internal working of city government and
relation to community
-students, Rutgers, and their relation and effects of students and 
overenrollment on New Brunswick
-all existing community organizations and resources geared to building
communities
-issues concerning New Brunswick schools and their performance
-information on employment, jobs, and related issues
-information on health care and its availability
-anything else that you think is important and should be included in
formulating a more complete history of the city

Sincerely,
Stevphen Shukaitis
97 Jones Avenue
New Brunswick, NJ 08901
732-846-1056

PS - There are also tentative plans being made for a Tenant's Rights
picnic on October 5th. If you would like to become involved with that
please contact me.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Sorry about that. The message got erased before I could get your number.
I'll call you tomorrow. Perhaps we could talk at the following event.

Stevphen
[Please forward widely and quickly]

On Wednesday at 5PM the city clerk will present to city council the
petition circulated by the Community Empowerment Project and New Brunswick
United to put stricter rent control on the ballot in November. The CEP is
encouraging all parties interested in seeing this effort to create more
just rental conditions in New Brunswick to attend the meeting and voice
their support for such measures in any manner they see fit. Although the
petition has over 1,000 signatures, it is all but assured that the
legitimacy and validity of evert last one will be challenged in efforts to
stop the measure from reaching the ballot.

The proposed act to be put on the ballot in November will freeze rents as
of May 2002 for one year, abolish vacancy decontrol, and cap all rent
increases at the rate of inflation (with exceptions for improvements to
the house and other such exceptions). It will greatly help to alleviate
many of the problems faced by New Brunswick residents in regards to ever
higher rents brought on by �business revitalization� and other such
measures.

Establishing a strong and unified presence at the meeting is necessary to
the importance and urgency of such measures. If the council rejects or
attempts the validity of the petition, court motions will be filed in
reponse by Thursday morning. For more information call 732-246-1130.

Subject:Community Guide to Rutgers and New Brunswick, 2002-2003!! (fwd)<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
Hi, everyone!

The much-discussed community guide/agenda project/etc is about to become a
reality--and it needs you! Your art, your photographs, your writing, and
your submissions and suggestions for:
-groups/organizations/institutions to list
-quotes/excerpts from other authors to include
-topics/sections
-whatever else you want to see!

The Community Guide/Agenda is designed to provide entering students at
Douglass College and Rutgers University with a ready-reference handbook to
the progressive and socially-active organizations in our campus and
community, as well as much needed information to become an active member
of the community, providing information such as meeting times for student
government associations and New Brunswick City Council, voter registration
information, deadlines and addresses, civil-rights information of which
students should be made aware and similar necessary information.

Following in the tradition of the Concordia Student Union
(http://www.csu.tao.ca/) at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec,
Canada, the community guide will be not merely a planner and a list of
names, addresses, and email contact info, but also a space for art,
writing, and other uncensored progressive student expression. Themes for
sections of the Guide include:

-Corporate vs. People's Redevelopment in New Brunswick
-Student Autonomy and Power
-Women's Issues
-Fighting Racism and Oppression
-International Solidarity
-Exposing the "War on Terror" and Defending Civil Liberties
-Queer Issues, Identity and Sexuality
-Working-class Struggle and Victory
-Corporations, National and Multinational
-Independent Media
-Campus/Community Involvement and Alliance

The many ways in which these themes can be expanded is nearly
endless--from rent control, to opposing military tests on Vieques, to the
power of student-controlled student fees, to...whatever! 

Therefore, I need your art and photography, to make this guide visually
exciting and interesting! If you are not a visual artist yourself, feel
free to submit and suggest the work of progressive artists who don't mind
us using their work (we'll attribute, of course). I also need your
(somewhat short) writing. Even I need to be somewhat tightly restrained  
in word count, since we're going for short, quick bus reads here. So don't
worry about producing full, long articles--short, pithy pieces are nothing
less than perfect. In the same vein, we also want quotes, excerpts, etc,
from others who have something important to say about these issues. 

The end result is to be a tapestry of struggle in words and images, and an
invitation to new students to join fully in their student and city
communities, ready for action! 

Of course...there is a deadline. 

Please send ANY suggestions ASAP to me here at ckates@...; if
you want to be on an email list to discuss, edit, etc, also email me and I
will add you! If you want to write something, let me know; if you want to
send art, let me know--if you have a submission by another artist/writer
and can't locate it, it's fine--I can also try to locate the reference
:-) Let me know *that* you want to write/contribute so I can allocate
space in layout...and send me your materials by NEXT Friday, August 30 at
midnight! 

This does have to go to the publisher, so timeliness is essential--and I
can do your layout for you (although tell me what you want visually if you
have an aesthetic preference)! 

Let's make this happen!

In struggle and solidarity, 

Charlotte

Subject:Take Back the City Meeting / Planning Session<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>[please forward widely, though not obnoxiously]

On August 27th there will be a meeting / planning session for the creation
of the �Take Back the City, Take Back Our Communities� pamphlet. This
pamphlet is intended to create an awareness of the past 30 years of New
Brunswick history, how corporate redevelopment and �business
revitalization� have negatively affected communities, families, and
individuals.

The meeting will occur at 7 pm at 97 Jones Avenue near Douglass Campus. It
is a white house on the corner of Jones and Handy, one block off of
Commercial Avenue, several blocks off of Route 18. For further information
either call 732-846-1056 or send a message to
takebackthecity@....

Here is a rough sketch of the project:

Take Back the City, Take Back Our Communities
-a brief history of corporate redevelopment efforts and a sketch of
community based alternatives to them-

Purpose:
* To frame the history of political events in New Brunswick over the past
20 to 30 years and how they have affected communities.
* To use such to establish a �cultural memory� for transitory student
populations, residents that have moved here recently, and those who have
been taken in by the corporate media bias about the actual nature of
�development� and �revitalization� in New Brunswick.
* To use such as a jumping point for suggesting community based
alternatives and measures that can be created to balance out the forces of

Message:<br><br>
<pre>URGENT APPEAL!!
INS Detainees are being refused medical care at Camden County Jail in New
Jersey

Please contact the INS Authorities and the Warden at Camden County Jail to
protest these conditions.  Demand that these INS detainees have immediate
access to doctors and receive all appropriate treatment.  At the moment the
detainees are refused access to doctors and are only being given Tylenol to
treat serious medical problems.

***Wilfredo Pineda, an El Salvadoran INS Detainee - prisoner #91436, has a
throat infection and bad cough for more than a month.

****Charles Mora, a Cuban INS Detainee - prisoner #92347, is suffering from a
hernia.

****Farouk Abdel-Muhti, a Palestinian INS Detainee - prisoner #99870, is

Mass deportations are continuing with Middle Easterners and South Asians being
sent back to certain imprisonment, torture or death.   We do not know when the
INS takes detainees away whether they are going to another facility or being
deported.  On Thursday, August 22 Egyptian detainee Mohammed Abdel-Azim
Abdel-Hafez was taken out of Camden County Jail.  We are concerned he is being
deported to Egypt.  If you have information about this detainee please contact
us immediately.

Detentions and deportations must stop immediately!  Get involved by holding
teach-ins and mobilizing protests in support of the detainees.  For more
information on the detainees and how to get involved contact Workers Democracy

Hi, everyone!

The much-discussed community guide/agenda project/etc is about to become a
reality--and it needs you! Your art, your photographs, your writing, and
your submissions and suggestions for:
-groups/organizations/institutions to list
-quotes/excerpts from other authors to include
-topics/sections
-whatever else you want to see!

The Community Guide/Agenda is designed to provide entering students at
Douglass College and Rutgers University with a ready-reference handbook to
the progressive and socially-active organizations in our campus and
community, as well as much needed information to become an active member
of the community, providing information such as meeting times for student
government associations and New Brunswick City Council, voter registration
information, deadlines and addresses, civil-rights information of which
students should be made aware and similar necessary information.

Following in the tradition of the Concordia Student Union
(http://www.csu.tao.ca/) at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec,
Canada, the community guide will be not merely a planner and a list of
names, addresses, and email contact info, but also a space for art,
writing, and other uncensored progressive student expression. Themes for
sections of the Guide include:

-Corporate vs. People's Redevelopment in New Brunswick
-Student Autonomy and Power
-Women's Issues
-Fighting Racism and Oppression
-International Solidarity
-Exposing the "War on Terror" and Defending Civil Liberties
-Queer Issues, Identity and Sexuality
-Working-class Struggle and Victory
-Corporations, National and Multinational
-Independent Media
-Campus/Community Involvement and Alliance

The many ways in which these themes can be expanded is nearly
endless--from rent control, to opposing military tests on Vieques, to the
power of student-controlled student fees, to...whatever!

Therefore, I need your art and photography, to make this guide visually
exciting and interesting! If you are not a visual artist yourself, feel
free to submit and suggest the work of progressive artists who don't mind
us using their work (we'll attribute, of course). I also need your
(somewhat short) writing. Even I need to be somewhat tightly restrained
in word count, since we're going for short, quick bus reads here. So don't
worry about producing full, long articles--short, pithy pieces are nothing
less than perfect. In the same vein, we also want quotes, excerpts, etc,
from others who have something important to say about these issues.

The end result is to be a tapestry of struggle in words and images, and an
invitation to new students to join fully in their student and city
communities, ready for action!

Of course...there is a deadline.

Please send ANY suggestions ASAP to me here at ckates@...; if
you want to be on an email list to discuss, edit, etc, also email me and I
will add you! If you want to write something, let me know; if you want to
send art, let me know--if you have a submission by another artist/writer
and can't locate it, it's fine--I can also try to locate the reference
:-) Let me know *that* you want to write/contribute so I can allocate
space in layout...and send me your materials by NEXT Friday, August 30 at
midnight!

This does have to go to the publisher, so timeliness is essential--and I
can do your layout for you (although tell me what you want visually if you
have an aesthetic preference)!

Let's make this happen!

In struggle and solidarity,

Charlotte










unite the many, defeat the few!

We raised nearly $5000 for Mumia's defense fund on that cold rainy Saturday

freedom happen!!  We raised money, ate amazing Boricua Criolla, listened to

The ProLibertad Freedom Challenge is not over; we still need to raise $5000

         U.S. NAVY OUT OF VIEQUES &amp; ALL OF PUERTO RICO!
  ____________________________________________________________

                       - PLEASE FORWARD -

All out 4:30 p.m., on Tuesday, September 3rd in solidarity with the people 
of Vieques, Puerto Rico. The U.S. Navy will resume its bombing destruction 
of the island of Vieques on that day.

The U.S. Government plans to carry out its war against the world's oppressed 
peoples by using the pretense of war against terrorism, this time against 
the Iraqi people. Government officials are claiming that the Navy must 
remain in Vieques in order to rehearse for the invasion of Iraq. We can only 
conclude that the tragic events of September 11, 2001 are being used to 
promote U.S. domination of the world.

President George W. Bush had hypocritically promised to withdraw the U.S 
Navy from Vieques in 2003. Why is it hypocritical? Because he himself is 
promoting the bombing of Iraq.

No one knows better than Puertoricans what the aims of the U.S warmongers 
are. Puerto Rico is a completely controlled country under U.S. colonial 
rule. Just as the people of Vieques who have suffered health epidemics as a 
result of the U.S. Navy occupation on that island, all the people of Puerto 
Rico have been denied the right to decide matters concerning their economic, 
social and political life.

Puerto Ricans and all peace-loving people can make a difference - united we 
can stop the criminal actions of military and government officials. Vieques, 
Puerto Rico must not be used to bring about further death to the people of 
Iraq.

Place: Times Square (43rd and Broadway) New York City
Date: Tuesday, September 3rd
Time: 4:30 PM

Bring your flags, signs, musical instruments and above all your will and
spirit to fight injustice.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>[Please Forward Widely]

Every year numerous groups and associations have events to introduce
themselves to the incoming student body and the communities in which they
live. Curiously, those who hold radical political ideals about social
change almost never do anything to present themselves to the students or
the community. Therefore this year there will be held a "Radical Rush," a
weeklong tongue in cheek celebration of radical politics and social
activism in New Brunswick. Those who want more information, directions, or
to get involved can either send a message to radicalrush@... or
call 732-846-1056.

Here is a schedule of events that have been planned for the week:

Thursday September 5th - 7:30 PM, Faculty Dining Room, Douglass Student
Center
"Yugoslav Experience and Radical Grass Roots Activism: from Social Forum
to European Social Consulta" a presentation and discussion by Professor
Andrej Grubacic from the University of Belgrade - Yugoslavia. He will
speak about his experiences organizing in Yugoslavia as well as the
tumultuous events that have wrecked havoc on that region. Professor
Grubabcic writes for Z Magazine and is the author of "The Globalization of
Poverty."

Saturday September 7th - 11 am - 6pm, Faculty Dining Room, Douglass
Student Center - "Skill shares and Training for Non-Hierarchal Social
Activism":
This will be a series of skill shares and workshops designed to provide
people with the skills and knowledge necessary for social activism without
hierarchy.

- 11AM-1PM, Know Your Rights: Basic Legal Information and Dealing with
Police Harassment and Intimidation - facilitated by Macdonald Scott from
the National Lawyers Guild

- 2PM-6PM, Facilitating Meetings and Consensus Based Decision Making -
facilitated by Stuart Rockefeller and Lesley Wood from the New York Direct
Action Network: an overview of how to run meetings without hierarchal
chains of command and the sometimes alienating nature of majoritarian
based structures

Sunday September 8th - 11 am - 6 pm, more skill shares

11AM-1PM, Let's Build Those Collectives - facilitated by Moose from the
Anarcho-nyc.net Projects Collective: an introduction on forming
collectives, affinity groups, and other types of organizations used within
social activism by current radicals

2PM-4PM, Activist, Heal Thyself: Basic Medical and First Aid Information -
facilitated by Charlie from the New Jersey Action Medics

4PM-6PM, meeting of the New Jersey Action Network, which is a loose
network of individuals and groups across New Jersey who coordinate

"defense of freedom" expanding war of world domination against
mostly poor countries populated by people of color and ruled by
corrupt despots and renegade extremists trained, installed &amp;
maintained in power by the US military. But behind the smoke and
mirrors are disturbing realities: the deepening crisis of world and
domestic capitalism; widening economic gaps between the US elite and

liberal agenda carried out by right wing war-hawks illegally
occupying the White House. Join us for the Harlem teach-in with
presentations by a diverse panel of Third World activists on WHY &amp;
HOW we must unite to fight against neo-liberal globalization that

Vieques Fast for Justice

Preparing for the Fast

It is recommended to gradually change your diet several days before the 
fast.

Day 5     Eliminate all oils and stimulants (coffee, sugar, chocolate,
alcohol, drugs)
Day 4     Eliminate all animal protein: fish, chicken, red meat, dairy
(cheese, milk)
Day 3     Eliminate all nuts, beans and grains (breads, pasta, rice, corn,
wheat,etc.)
Day 2     Eliminate all vegetables and fruits
Day 1     Eliminate all juices, if you are fasting on water only.

Important rules to follow while
preparing for, during and after the fast.

  1. See a doctor before beginning a requires Fast.
  2. Overeating is to be avoided at all times, chew your food well and 
slowly.
  3. Drink 8 glasses of water daily and one gallon of distilled water during
Fast.
  4. Drink herbal tea to warm up (peppermint, camomile, or rose hips). p
  5. Sip water with lemon juice and honey if you feel dizzy or chills.
  6. Take a herbal laxative or enema if you get a head ache.
  7. Exercise daily, less strenuous during Fast.
  8. Dry brush and shower daily (hot then cold to stimulate the 
circulation).
  9. Brush your teeth at least 3 times a day.
10. Rest, keep warm and sun yourself every day.
11. Meditate, read, write, listen to music and get a massage.
12. Think positively, surround yourself with beauty and nurturing people.
13. Fast a day at a time, remember why you are fasting at all times.

Breaking the Fast

"Any fool can start a fast, it takes a wise person to break one".

     To break the fast it is recommended that you gradually increase your 
food intake working backwards from Day 1 (see above).  Breaking the fast 
takes half the number of days as you were fasting.  If fasting 8 days, it 
will take 4 days or 12 meals to break your fast.  Take your time and work 
your way back to cooked and hard to digest foods "SLOWLY".  Hard to digest 
foods are: grains, beans, potatoes, meats, oils and fried foods.  For 
healthy eating:  a) Stay away from stimulants, red meats and fried foods.  
b) Eat plenty of organic fruits and vegetables ( steamed, raw and juiced ) 
and drink
plenty of water daily.

Vieques Fast for Justice

Preparing for the Fast

It is recommended to gradually change your diet several days before the 
fast.

Day 5     Eliminate all oils and stimulants (coffee, sugar, chocolate,
alcohol, drugs)
Day 4     Eliminate all animal protein: fish, chicken, red meat, dairy
(cheese, milk)
Day 3     Eliminate all nuts, beans and grains (breads, pasta, rice, corn,
wheat,etc.)
Day 2     Eliminate all vegetables and fruits
Day 1     Eliminate all juices, if you are fasting on water only.

Important rules to follow while
preparing for, during and after the fast.

  1. See a doctor before beginning a requires Fast.
  2. Overeating is to be avoided at all times, chew your food well and 
slowly.
  3. Drink 8 glasses of water daily and one gallon of distilled water during
Fast.
  4. Drink herbal tea to warm up (peppermint, camomile, or rose hips). p
  5. Sip water with lemon juice and honey if you feel dizzy or chills.
  6. Take a herbal laxative or enema if you get a head ache.
  7. Exercise daily, less strenuous during Fast.
  8. Dry brush and shower daily (hot then cold to stimulate the 
circulation).
  9. Brush your teeth at least 3 times a day.
10. Rest, keep warm and sun yourself every day.
11. Meditate, read, write, listen to music and get a massage.
12. Think positively, surround yourself with beauty and nurturing people.
13. Fast a day at a time, remember why you are fasting at all times.

Breaking the Fast

"Any fool can start a fast, it takes a wise person to break one".

     To break the fast it is recommended that you gradually increase your 
food intake working backwards from Day 1 (see above).  Breaking the fast 
takes half the number of days as you were fasting.  If fasting 8 days, it 
will take 4 days or 12 meals to break your fast.  Take your time and work 
your way back to cooked and hard to digest foods "SLOWLY".  Hard to digest 
foods are: grains, beans, potatoes, meats, oils and fried foods.  For 
healthy eating:  a) Stay away from stimulants, red meats and fried foods.  
b) Eat plenty of organic fruits and vegetables ( steamed, raw and juiced ) 
and drink
plenty of water daily.

Foes call for change as mayor cites achievements

Published in the Home News Tribune 9/24/02
By SHARON WATERS
STAFF WRITER

NEW BRUNSWICK: Mayor Jim Cahill said he should be re-elected in November 
because of his experience, but two challengers said it's time for a change, 
during a meeting with the Home News Tribune editorial board yesterday.

Independent mayoral candidates Keith V. Thomas, a public school science 
teacher, and James Neal, a police officer, each said the city's priorities 
should be reorganized with more emphasis on education and neighborhoods.

Thomas stressed his experience building diverse coalitions.

"We need a man of the people and not a man of the tower," said Thomas, 
perhaps best known for helping organizing a petition for a stronger 
rent-control law.

Neal, who lost his last four bids for mayor, said the African-American 
community has been left out of city decisions.

"Mr. Neal is going to make programs to hold your head up, your chest out and 
make you feel good," Neal said.

Cahill pointed to achievements during his three terms, including a lower 
crime rate, new jobs, more recreation programs and an improving school 
system.

Cahill answered criticisms from his challengers by asking where they were 
before the political season started.

Thomas proposed such changes as making public schools more accessible to the 
handicapped, posting public records on the Internet and having City Council 
members face the audience at meetings as a sign they want to include the 
public.

Neal, an advisor for the Royal Unique Drill and Drum Corps, said he would 
create a high school band, and offer incentives to police officers and 
firefighters to entice them to live in New Brunswick.

Both Neal and Thomas said New Brunswick's school board should be elected, 
not appointed by the mayor. Cahill noted a vote by city residents on an 
elected school board has failed four times.

Thomas criticized the process for the CORE Vision Plan, saying residents 
were not consulted during the design of the $750 million 
downtown-redevelopment plan.

Cahill said the plan is in "a sitting mode" now.

"The CORE plan is a vision. It is not etched in stone," said Cahill. "It 
serves as a tool for developers to react to."

Joining Neal at the meeting was Housing Authority commissioner and 
Republican municipal chairman Frank Bright, who also ran for mayor four 
years ago. Neal touted his former rival's involvement as an example of his 
ability to achieve inclusion and progress. Neal said Bright and Cliff Smith 
are his campaign managers.

The mayor was accompanied by his spokesman, Edward Bray. Cahill said it was 
not a conflict for Bray, a city employee, to come to the political editorial 
meeting because the mayor would be talking about "governmentally driven" 
information. Cahill said he wanted Bray there to ensure he gave the board 
accurate information.

Cahill said he is serving as his own campaign manager.

Thomas was joined by a campaign intern who took notes. Thomas said he has 
several campaign managers who work on different issues, including Xavier 
Hansen and Tom DeGloma.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>New Jersey Solidarity will sponsor a film showing of GAZA STRIP, the
acclaimed documentary by James Longley, at 7:00 PM on Saturday, September
28, in the Faculty Dining Room of the Douglass College Center.

"GAZA STRIP pushes the viewer headlong into the tumult of the
Israeli-occupied Gaza, examining the lives and views of ordinary
Palestinians.

The documentary often sees the world through the eyes of young people. The
central character is Mohammed Hejazi, a 13-year-old paperboy in Gaza City,
one of the young "stone-throwers" who risk their lives throwing rocks at
Israeli tanks across the barbwire fences. As the newspapers arrive
announcing Ariel Sharon's victory in the Israeli elections, Mohammed offers
up tirades against Arafat and Sharon alike. We also catch glimpses of his
inner world: his sense of hopelessness, his sorrow at the IDF killing of his
best friend, his conception of death.

As the camera floats through the Gaza Strip, we encounter signs of the
occupation everywhere: crowds of Palestinians are making their way along the
beach on foot, donkey carts and tractor trailers when the Israeli soldiers
close the roads. The Palestinians interviewed as they pass by reveal a
common internal conflict, between anger at the Israeli occupation and the
desire to live in peace."

Running time: 73 minutes

Greetings and Peace All.

The New Jersey government is asking Brother Amiri Baraka to resign from his 
post as New Jersey Poet Laureate for merely speaking the truth.  Please see 
Brother Amiri's message I've posted at the very end to all of us about this 
issue.  The poem is absolutely poignant.  I have posted it immediately 
below.  We can't let free speech be suppressed!  Contact Gov. McGreevey 
(contact info. below as well) as well as your other local officials if you 
want to ensure that the few rights we have left will not be decimated.

Here's the poem; judge for yourself . . .

A poets response to all that is revolving around Amiri
Barakas poem "Somebody Blew Up America"
A poets response to everyone that wants to live in a
world that kills truth, so that they can prosper,
whoever they be. A Thank you to a man that makes me
want more truth, by sharing with me the light he has,
selflessly.

What You Scared of Man

You gotta admit what you be
you be stone cold killas
you gotta admit what you be
you see my man
you be nothing more than a stone cold killa
the American kind
you be one of those cats that love waving the flag
and calling me UnAmerican if I don't
(You think I care if you call me American or not)
you be so happy thriving off these treacherous
American values
you be one of those fools that sing "My Country 'tis
of thee" real loud, you know what I mean
you be getting high on that joint called America
you be one like the President that don't even know the
words to the National anthem
and be on television lip-synching
making a bigger fool of himself,
than we already know he is -
hey I know the song man
and ain't none of that song got nothing to do with me/
you gotta admit what you be
you be so proud, so patriotic, so brilliantly painted
with the blood, white, and the blue -
so graciously fucked up killing every body that ain't
rich, blond, and blue
Don't tell me that ain't American man
Don't tell me that ain't you man
Don't keep calling me crazy man
You a stone cold killa
who? who? who?
you man you...
you
not hardworking
not overtiming it to feeds yo kids
not struggling to keep yo son from dieing in the
hustle
not teaching yo kids to never reach in they pockets
around a white cop with a gun
not sitting across from that public aide worker
getting drilled for a 75.00 a week allowance
nah man, uh uh, not you
you be riding high in America
living that dream thing
being a king on easy street
sleeping in the big house
while you breaking my mommas back
you be real real good time American
You be a stone cold killa
that's what you be
Don't hate me cause I see
I'm still broke
still choking on street smoke
still falling fast
getting hollow points in my black ass
so the least you can do Massa
is let me speak!
You still got yo foot on me
let me write my little ass poem
leave me be
You still on top man
It's gonna take a little bit more for you to fall man
you and all yo buddies still getting away with being
counterfeit man
yo kids still gonna get they Ivy league education man
yo maid still gonna cook you the best meals man
and yo wife still gonna smile for every camera man
so what you scared of man
come on you can tell me
come on you can tell me
give it to me straight
what you scared of man
what you trying to hide
give me the truth man
give me the truth
so I can write my next poem...
You got the whole world man
you gonna let me write my next poem right?

Statement by Amiri Baraka, New Jersey Poet Laureate 10/2/2002

I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE, I WILL NOT RESIGN!

             The recent dishonest, consciously distorted and insulting
non-interpretation of my poem, "Somebody Blew Up America" by the
"Anti-Defamation" League, is fundamentally an attempt to defame me. And with 
that, an attempt to repress and stigmatize independent thinkers everywhere.

               This trashy propaganda is characteristic of right-wing 
zealots who are interested only in slander and character assassination of 
those whose views or philosophies differ from, or are in contradiction to 
theirs.

                First, the poem's underlying theme focuses on how Black 
Americans have suffered from domestic terrorism since being kidnapped into 
US chattel slavery, e.g., by Slave Owners, US &amp; State Laws, Klan, SkinHeads, 
Domestic Nazis, Lynching, denial of rights, national oppression, racism, 
character assassination, historically, and at this very minute throughout 
the US. The relevance of this to Bush's call for a "War on Terrorism", is 
that Black people feel we have always been victims of terror, governmental 
and general, so we cannot get as frenzied and hysterical as the people who, 
while asking us to dismiss our history and contemporary reality to join 
them, in the name of a shallow "patriotism" in attacking the majority of 
people in the world, especially people of color and in the third world.

             This is said to us, even as this counterfeit president has
legalized the Confederate Flag in Mississippi. Could the victims of European 
Fascism be as frantically loyal to a regime that would fly a Nazi Swastika 
over their homes? So we cannot, in good conscience, celebrate, what seems to 
us, an international crusade to set up a military dictatorship over the 
world, legitimatized at base, by white supremacy, carried out, no matter the 
crude lies, as the most terrifying form of Imperialism and its attendant 
national oppression. All of it designed to drain super-profits bluntly from 
the colored peoples of the world, but as well, from the majority of the 
peoples in the world. For all the frantic condemnations of Terror by Bush 
&amp;c, as the single International Super Power, they are the most dangerous 
terrorists in the world!

             Actually, in my focus on various forces of terror Afro 
Americans and other oppressed people of the world have suffered, slavery, 
colonialism, Imperialism, Neo-colonialism, National Oppression, the ADL 
disingenuously makes no mention of my probing into the creators of the 
holocaust, e.g., "Who put the Jews in ovens, / and who helped them do it, / 
Who said 'America First'/ and Ok'd the yellow stars", which of course is a 
reference to America's domestic fascists just before World War II and the 
Nazi Holocaust.

             Nor do these ADL purveyors of falsehood mention the poem's 
listing of some of the Jews across the world, oppressed, imprisoned murdered 
by actual Anti- Semitic forces, open or disguised. The poem asks "Who killed 
Rosa Luxembourg, Liebnecht/Who murdered the Rosenbergs/ And all the good 
people iced, tortured, assassinate, vanished".

             The ADL apparently is not outraged by McCarthy era frame-up and 
execution of the Rosenbergs, nor the assassination of German-Jewish 
Communist leaders like Liebnecht, Luxembourg. The ADL leaves these things 
out to try to make their lies more believable, and also because these 
victims of imperialism were on the Left.

           Happily the Star Ledger published the entire poem, though 
including in a box, supposedly identifying the offending phrases, my 
question, "Who Blew Up The Reichstag?" as if the ADL had also claimed that 
the poem was inferring that Jews did it. When it was Hitler's destruction of 
the Reichstag, that provided the pretext for the general imprisonment of 
Jews, after incarcerating Communists, Social Democrats and Trade Unionists.  
Why this was done one can only speculate,but this is the kind of sloppy or 
intentionally slanderous journalism one can often find in the media. It also 
reflects the kind of unprincipled attack that characterizes ADL press 
release.

             The Reichstag fire, parallels the 911 Attack, in that after 
that "mysterious act of terrorism", which Hitler blamed on Jews and 
Communists, the Nazis passed a law The Reichstag Enablement Act, that gave 
the Nazis much the same carte blanche as the Bush administration used the 
911 tragedy to pass the wholly undemocratic Patriot Bill and begin rounding 
up suspects, even without identifying them. Of course the actual arsonists 
of the Reichstag terror were never found, though most scholars are certain 
it was the Nazis themselves.

             Of the other lines of the poem, which the ADL termed an  
example of the Hitlerian "Big Lie", and the poet's "spewing Anti-Semitic 
venom". The lines, "Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get/bombed?" 
Well now, certainly, even the Democratic Party has affirmed that the Bush 
Administration knew. I agree with this, and it is everywhere on the Internet 
that not only was the US warned repeatedly by Germany, France, Russia, 
England but also Israel. Michael Ruppert of the Green Party has issued a 
video stating clearly, "Israeli security issued urgent warnings to the CIA 
of large-scale terror attacks." And that the Israeli Mossad knew that the 
attacks were going to take place--they knew that the World Trade Center were 
the targets. This is from British newspaper the "Telegraph".(Copies of these 
documents available with this statement.)

             In addition there are articles in all forms of media and of 
course the Internet confirming or suggesting that the entire Imperialist 
world knew and had warned the US CIA in advance, but no action was taken. 
WHY. They say they "couldn't connect the dots".  The FBI agents in Minnesota 
and Arizona who sd that FBI received a report in 1998 that a terrorist 
organization "planned to bring people to the US to enroll in flight 
schools".  Zacharias Moussoui, now charged with conspiring in the Sept 11 
attacks, was arrested by the Minnesota agents of the FBI in August 2001 but 
FBI HQ denied agents' request to seek a warrant even to search his computer. 
And in a prepared statement by a Minnesota FBI agent, he blamed legal 
restrictions, but principally FBI headquarters for impeding a more 
aggressive investigation of this man.  As for the other agent's attempt to 
warn the FBI HQ of these attacks, he was rebuffed when he made the report, 
but now FBI HQ says it has no record of such warning. (See 
Truthout.org/docs) There are other incredible dots on the media, for 
instance the stockholders of American Airlines and United, which were the 
carriers hijacked to commit the terror, began withdrawing stock from these 
companies in August before the attacks.

             The most offensive phrase in the poem to my various attackers 
is, "Who told 4000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers / to stay home that 
day/ Why did Sharon stay away?" To infer that I am accusing Israel of 
committing the atrocity is disingenuous slander and character assassination. 
But I do believe, as I stated about England, Germany, France, Russia, that 
the Israeli government, certainly it's security force, SHABAK, knew about 
the attack in advance.

              My sources were, "Ha'aretz" and "Yadiot Ahranot" (two Israeli 
newspapers) "Al Watan" (a Jordanian newspaper), "Manar"-TV and the website 
of the Israeli security force SHABAK. There are myriad references to this in 
Reuters, Der Spiegel.

             The Israeli newspaper Yadiot Ahranot lst revealed that SHABAK 
had canceled Sharon"s appearance in New York City that day, Sept 11, where 
he was supposed to speak at an "Israel Day" celebration. This was also 
mentioned in the Star Ledger, to the effect that Sharon was supposed to 
visit the US, but no dates were mentioned.

             It is the Green Party"s Ruppert who makes the most effective 
case for the 4000 Israeli workers (Not Jewish Workers!) but Israeli 
nationals.  He says in his video,  "If what I am showing you is known 
overtly all through the media, how much more does our thirty billion dollar 
intelligence community know?"

             He goes on, and this seems true to me, It is "Nonsense" to say 
the Israelis did it. They were warning the U.S. hand over fist. "Ruppert 
speculates further 1. The US did not listen 2. They needed the attacks" 
which I leave to time, as Malcolm X sd, Time will tell.

             But the most stunning revelation is this, again Ruppert, "We 
reviewed the list of former tenants of the World Trade Center at the on-line 
Wall St Journal site. And there's the website. It is an alphabetical list of 
tenants. Scroll to the very bottom and notice the moving date for the office 
of Zim American-Israeli Shipping to Norfolk Virginia. They were in the World 
Trade Center. They must have had Mossad (or Shabak- AB) input because they 
vacated one week before September and they broke their lease. The Israeli's 
didn't pull the attack, but they were smart enough to get their people out 
of the way. How come our government didn't do the same thing for us?"  
(Statement&amp; Quote by George DeCarlo, Coordinator of Union County Greens, Co 
Founderof the NJ Lavender Greens- included in media pkg.)

             The poem was never saying anything else, i.e., why didn't the 
other slaughtered Americans know? I WAS NOT SAYING ISRAEL WAS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE ATTACK, BUT THAT THEY KNEW AND OUR OWN COUNTERFEIT PRESIDENT DID 
TOO!

             There is other disturbing facts surrounding the hideous 911 
attacks, which my family and I could see from the third floor bathroom 
window of our homes! And certainly one day all this will be thoroughly 
investigated.  The poem says "Who know why Five Israelis was filming the 
explosion/ And cracking they sides at the notion." I got this story from The 
Star Ledger, where it appeared twice, and The New York Times.

             The reference to "cracking they sides" or laughing uproariously 
while filming the 911 attack, apparently on the top of a truck from the 
Jersey side is a direct paraphrase of the Ledger articles. In fact, the 
State Police, who arrested them, stated that that is one of the reasons they 
did arrest them, because they were laughing.

             Again, these were Israeli Nationals, persons holding Israeli 
passports. The Times article even reported on what their lives were like in 
Jail. And implied they would be deported.  So this reference is not more of 
the ADL's "Anti-Semitic venom" but arrived at merely from studying the US 
media.

             Why those five Israelis were there filming and laughing I do 
not claim know. That's why the poem here and throughout continuously chants 
the question WHO WHO WHO? That is, who is responsible for this horrible 
crime and WHY? It is a poem that aims to probe and disturb, but there is not 
the slightest evidence of Anti-Semitism, as anyone who reads it without some 
insidious bias would have to agree. Why the ADL would do this, I can only 
speculate.

             I wish they and other concerned pundits would speculate on how 
an Airplane flying in America, where the pilot has to file a flight plan 
before taking off, how can such a plane or two or three of them file such a 
route in which they would travel, and in the case of the planes leaving 
Boston make 45 degree turns south and fly 54 minutes to the World Trade 
Center and 90 minutes to the Pentagon and not be challenged by US Air 
Defense Fighters, or brought down by ground to air missiles?

Having been in the Air Force I know those ADC fighters would normally 
confront such "rogue" aircraft within a few minutes! Why was this not done? 
Let the ADL and the media investigating me, investigate that!

             We should know that Bush and his Right Wing crew want War 
against all the forces of their so called "Axis of Evil" What a not so wild 
coincidence that the path of this Axis parallels the route of the proposed 
US oil corporations- pipe line from Saudi to the far east, apparently to 
oppose the spiraling economic growth and influence of China. They scream 
"Bin Laden" and "Taliban" and destroy Afghanistan, install a puppet 
president and a shadow occupation force.

             Next in the Axis is Iraq, we should have known that. With no 
real proof at all, again the people of the US, outraged and frightened by 
the Reichstag of 911, are hyped with chants of "Regime Change" and "Saddam 
Hussein". No longer is the madness of crowds being aroused by the 
"Anti-Terrorist" campaign and Bin Laden as the Devil figure used to rouse 
the people to a patriotic frenzy, now it is Saddam Hussein. So forget last 
month's war and get ready for this month's.

             Bush says he wants "regime change" in Palestine, he wants to 
oust Arafat, now in Iraq, and he wants to oust Saddam. The Axis projects 
Iran next and then North Korea. What is this, an updated version of 1984 or 
an American version of Hitler's and Bush I's New World Order?

             Regime Change, why? Because these regimes are anti democratic 
or terrorists or in thecase of Saddam, they have "weapons of mass 
destruction".

Well if being anti-democratic were a good rationalization for foreign
invasions of countries, then the United States better watch out because the 
Florida coup, which tricked the American people into accepting Bush as 
President, is anything but democratic. Should we let foreign countries 
invade us to get rid of Bush? What would be the American People's reaction 
to such Third Reich replay?

             And as for Saddam having "weapons of mass destruction" (or mass 
diversion as some critics say) The US has these weapons. So do Israel, South 
Africa, Germany, France, Italy, England, Russia, and now China, India, 
Pakistan. How is it the US and its allies (except the Chinese) can have such 
weapons, but no one else can. The answer to that, of course, is White 
Supremacy and Imperialism. And what should be the growing understanding by 
the American people and the democratic people of the world, is what the far 
right Bush coven wants is a military dictatorship of the world.

            The ADL, by attacking me, by distorting what my poem is saying, 
is doing its usual ugly, as a well known running dog of imperialism, 
particularly by attacking anyone who takes an independent position or is 
critical of Israeli Imperialism and its attendant ideology: political 
Zionism. As they are attempting with me, the ADL slanders anyone who is not 
happy with Israel's ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians as Anti-Semitic, 
when lst of all Israel and its guiding philosophy have nothing to do, as 
categories, with Jews.(See "Zionism in the Age of the Dictators", Brenner)

             But this is the trick such demagogues as the ADL use to hide 
the crimes of Imperialist Israel. When we criticize US imperialism, does 
that make us enemies of Christianity, maybe only to Jerry Falwell and such 
Right wing Christian Zealots, perhaps Asscraft. But neither Israel nor 
Zionism is the same as Judaism.  (Op cit Brenner; also "The Dilemma of the 
Modern Jew", Prinz.) But this is the trick the Israeli's and their 
sympathizers use to hide behind Judaism. Israel (and its political Zionism) 
has as much to do with Judaism, as the US has to do with Christianity.

             In the US our constitution makes clear that this is a secular 
nation, and by law theoretically enforces separation of church and state, 
though Mr. Bush and Mr. Asscraft have demonstrated they disagree, and Israel 
outright says it is a "Jewish State". But if that is so then that explains 
why it can discriminate against its Arab people living inside Israel and 
make them 2nd class citizens, in much the same way that South Africa, a 
close friend did under Apartheid. (See "The Crisis of Black Jewish 
Relations", Brenner &amp; Bloom; "Israel and South Africa", Stevens &amp; Ellmessi; 
The "Arabs in Israel" by Sabri Jiryis, foreword by Noam Chomsky)

             The ADL attacks so it can confuse people and show me as just 
another Anti-Semitic attacker of their absolutely false depictions of Israel 
as a victim of Palestinian Terrorism. This is absolutely in tune with the 
Bush administration's frenzied destroy-Iraq-regime-change "Jones" (a street 
word for narcotics addiction), that the administration is chanting around us 
like cheer leaders at a football game! So that US imperialism can transform 
the whole of the Middle East, the Arab world into a gas station (See 
"Bushwacked: A Counterfeit President for a Fake Democracy", Baraka)

             So that we are supposed to believe that if a little girl blows 
herself up in an Israeli Pizza Parlor, she is a terrorist, but when Israeli 
Jets, made in the USA, destroy whole sections of Palestinian cities, 
bulldoze neighborhoods, all but destroy the Palestinian Center of 
Governance, with its President, Yasser Arafat, inside sitting in the dark, 
it is the Israelis who are victims and the little Palestinian girl or boy or 
young man or young woman or even elder, they are the terrorists. We are 
supposed to be intimidated by demagogues like the Anti Defamation League 
(who shd be called the Anti- Anti-Defamation League) so that Israel, as a 
jr. partner of the Bush-led US goose-step to world military domination, can 
commit ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in the name of fighting 
terrorism.

             It is the ADL which is actually guilty of what its leader,
Abraham Foxman, calls the Hitlerian "Big Lie", and ironically it is the ADL, 
which is "spewing anti-Semitic venom". The same ADL which became aware of 
"Black Anti Semitism", which it had earlier said has never been a threat, 
until Stokely Carmichael and SNCC began to support the PLO and the 
Palestinian Struggle as a Liberation Struggle, and condemn Israeli 
Imperialism and Zionism. That is when, as Stokeley Carmichael says in the 
APRP's "Smash Zionism", the ADL smashed SNCC instead.

             As Israel drew closer to South Africa, politically, 
economically, militarily in the 60's  (Op Cit, above &amp; others) the Black 
Liberation Movement and African Nations became more and more guilty, 
according to the ADL, of "Black Anti-Semitism".

          This is the same ADL who opposed Affirmative Action, even though 
many Jews benefited by the Civil Rights Struggle, and the most notable white 
comrades in that struggle were young Jews. The same ADL that filed an Amicus 
Curiae (friend of the court brief) in the historic and reactionary Baake 
Decision which challenged &amp; defeated the University of California's 
affirmative action as "racist" and was explained by the ADL as its 
opposition to quotas. So that the university could now enforce a quota on 
Black students of none!

             This is the same ADL, which in league with the American Israel 
Political Action Committee, just a few weeks ago sent millions of dollars 
into Atlanta, Georgia to defeat progressive Black Congress woman Cynthia 
McKinney, because she called for a more balanced American view of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Conflict.

These same forces defeated, in Alabama, another progressive Black incumbent 
Congressman, because he too dared to support the Palestinians. (See New York 
Times, Amsterdam News, Star Ledger).

             Very much like the way Bush touts "Regime Change," recently 
even hinting at an attempted Assassination of Saddam Hussein, if the 
American People rise up and force our congress to deny the Bush juggernaut 
of terror to attack Iraq. ADL and their "bagman", AIPAC, didn't like these 
black politicians' stance on Israel, so in a minute and a few million 
dollars, they are gone!

             So now, it's my turn. Using my poem, "Somebody Blew Up America" 
they are going to spread the Big Lie, distort what poem says. Cover the fact 
that this poem actually is an attack on Imperialism, National Oppression, 
Monopoly Capitalism, Racism, Anti-Semitism.  I challenge ADL to show 
anywhere in this poem that is Anti-Semitic in the least. In their press 
release they say talk about "Jews being scapegoated throughout history", 
then conspiracy mongers of the Arab world "have taken Anti-Israel propaganda 
to a new level". (Mr. Foxman, what is the Arab World? Alan Dershowitz in his 
"Chutzpah" says the basis of bigotry is "over generalization", so where is 
the "Arab World"? Is Detroit included? Asscraft thinks so.)

           Earlier the press release mentions "the Muslim World", does that 
include Lyons Ave, Newark? But then from "Anti-Semitism" the
release goes to Israel, not Jews, and Israeli Mossad as those victimized. So 
they fight Anti Semitism mainly by "defending" Israel.  In fact they defend 
Israel like Joe McCarthy "defended" the US against Communism. Included in my 
package is a communique from an Israeli Peace Organization: Gush Shalom, 
Israeli Peace Bloc (see Defamation from the Anti Defamation League Answered" 
(info@...). This was first published 7/11/2000 as a press 
release.

             "In the past 24 hours, an attack is being mounted against Gush 
Shalom. Knesset Member Collette Avital (Labor) has actually lodged a 
complaint with the police, claiming that cartoons presented on our website 
constitute "incitement". And the powerful American Jewish organization, 
Anti-Defamation League, found time, even on election day over there, to 
disseminate a message of defamation against "Gush Shalom", which already 
resulted in hate e-mails being sent our address."

             In a following message signed by Adam Keller, Gush Shalom
spokesperson, the organization defends itself from an ADL press release
"expressing outrage at Gush Shalom's portrayal of Prime Minster Barak as a 
killer of Palestinian children in a caricature on its web site, stating that 
the image of Barak standing on the bleeding bullet ridden body of a 
Palestinian child is abhorrent."

             Gush Shalom replies, "Still after consulting with my fellow 
activists I am in a position to make an offer. Should a complete week -- 
seven days pass in which not a single unarmed Palestinian is killed by the 
Israeli armed forces which are answerable to Mr. Barak, we would remove the 
above mentioned cartoon from our website."

             The Gush Shalom statement ends "As for the ADL- an  
organization which claims to 'counter hatred, prejudice and bigotry', can 
you truly find no other places to search for such, with Israeli society in 
its present condition, except at our modest website?" Was the ADL attacking 
these Israelis for being Anti Semitic, or for criticizing rather forcefully 
the continuous murder of the Palestinians. So in Israel itself, ADL is still 
covering for and attacking anyone, even Israeli citizens themselves, who 
oppose the Bush Zionist Plan to de-Palestinianize Palestine!

             Another communication from Israel (robertoj69@...). This 
signed by 95 IsraeliAcademics (copy included in pkg), Sept 23, 2002 that 
begins "URGENT WARNING: THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT MAY BE CONTEMPLATING CRIMES 
AGAINST HUMANITY" It goes on, "We members of the Israeli academe are 
horrified by US buildup of aggression towards Iraq and by the Israeli 
political leadership's enthusiastic support of it. We are deeply worried by 
indications that the 'fog of war' could be exploited by the Israeli 
government to commit further crimes against the Palestinian people, up to 
full-fledged ethnic cleansing."

                         One striking description of the Israeli Military by 
these professors is that in an interview found in Ha'aretz Sept 19, 2002, 
Israeli Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon describe the Palestinians as a 
"cancerous manifestation" and equated the military actions in the Occupied 
territories with chemotherapy".

Certainly the ADL will have to go after these "Anti Semites" using the "Big 
Lie" and "Spewing Anti-Semitic Venom"! And the growing list of progressive 
democratic people around the world who will have opinions about Israel and 
Political Zionism independent of the ADL, the ADL will have to attack and 
slander them as well.

           I challenge the ADL to set up a national television program so 
that we might debate this issue. We can project the poem on a wall and go 
down line by line and discuss it. If not that, then why not a forum or 
debate some place like NYC Town Hall or at Symphony Hall in Newark.

             Why not take a survey of those who heard the poem at the Dodge 
Festival? Those who registered and the students brought by schools could be 
contacted and a survey taken to reflect what the majority of people hearing 
the poem thought, not just some shadowy surrogates of Imperialism, who are 
trying to convince people that I and my poem are the enemy, not US and 
Israeli Imperialism.

            I have already gotten a great many communications praising the 
poem. A great many E-mail letters and phone calls not only praising the 
poem, and the poet for writing it, but also opposing the attempt to violate 
my first amendment rights by this oft repeated ADL skin game of calling 
critics of imperialism AntiSemites.

             I have already said, in answer to what Governor McGreevey is 
quoted as demanding that I apologize and that I resign as NJ Poet Laureate. 
And I have said repeatedly that I will do neither. It is unfortunate that 
Governor McGreevey has been stampeded by paid liars, and apologists for 
ethnic cleansing and white supremacy, bourgeois nationalists and the 
dangerously ignorant, to be panicked into joining in the ADL's slander, 
belittling my intelligence, and insulting no t only my person, my family, my 
fellow artists and activists who know all this is just the feces of a very 
small cow. But they are also attacking my work in the arts and my social 
political views. By demanding that I apologize to Evil and Submit to some 
fundamentally racist and politically motivated call for me to resign as New 
Jersey's Poet Laureate, he is insulting the broad group of people who know 
he is incorrect and who have read and celebrated and valued my work. And 
that is a grave mistake, one I am hoping he will correct.

             "Somebody Blew Up America!" was written Oct 1, 2001. A month 
after the terror attack.  Almost immediately I circulated it around the 
world on the Internet. In addition, I have read this poem in Spain, 
Portugal, Africa, Switzerland, Italy, Finland and it was translated into 
German and read on German radio, at Universities and other venues across 
this country. It has become one of the most circulated of my poems.

             Yet it was not until I read the poem at the Dodge Poetry 
Festival that I got negative response from three people that I know of. The 
overwhelming response was an almost thunderous applause. I even had to come 
out and take a second bow at one performance. So why now and Who, as the 
poem asks, is behind it? Perhaps the forces which have dishonestly tried to 
characterize the poem as "venom" or merely "a harangue" (just as they called 
John Coltrane's music "Barbaric Yawps") are simply the Charlie McCarthy 
voices for Bush &amp; Sharon's Edgar Bergen's. Empty-headed devilish dummies 
constructed of wood and painted and costumed  to look like it is real people 
speaking, when all the time it is imperialism the ventriloquist speaking 
through their mouths.

         NO, I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE, I WILL NOT RESIGN. In fact I will 
continue to do what I have appointed to do, but still have not been paid to 
do.  Publicize and Popularize poetry and poets throughout this state. To set 
up new venues and new networks for poetry reading and workshops, in the 
state's libraries and schools and other institutions. Hopefully initiated 
and given paradigm right here in the Newark Public Library, its branches and 
throughout the school system. Therefore giving more of our citizens access 
to poetry, involving poets of all nationalities, both male and female, of 
diverse experience and styles. I have already begun to enlist coordinators 
of poetry programs throughout the state, so that we can network a tour of 
poets, hopefully beginning in January, throughout the state.

             To do this I will be approaching local, county, state, federal 
and private funding. And expand our budget with the cooperation of these 
other existing programs.  We will ask that poets POET-ON! That they begin to 
produce at least one poem or publish a poem monthly, in the most modest 
forms, Kinko style, and give them away if they have to. That they begin to 
set up readings not only in the places we mentioned but also in parks and 
restaurants and in neighborhoods.

             We say this because we feel that this state and indeed this 
nation and this world is desperately in need of the deepest and most 
profound human values that poetry can teach. That is what Keats and Du Bois 
called for the poet to do, to bring Truth and Beauty. To be like the most 
ancient paradigmythic image of the poet. To be like Osiris and Orpheus, 
whose job it was to raise the Sun each morning with song and story. To 
illuminate the human mind, and bring light into the world. POET ON!





unite the many, defeat the few!

<pre>new brunswick peoples' campaign 2002
unity, criticism, unity

We applaud the Cahill administration for having joined our call to remove 
Republican leader, Frank Bright, from the New Brunswick Housing Authority, 
and encourage Mayor Cahill to immediately install an elected, resident, 
public housing commission, in order to democratically reflect the special 
needs of public housing residents.  Mr. Bright was appointed by a Republican 
governor, and violated what public confidence he had, if any.

We condemn past, hurtful attacks by Mr. Bright on any person suffering a 
disability.  My father has been blind since the age of 12, so I can speak 
personally of the demanding struggle I have seen him endure, and of his 
accomplishments, for which I have great pride.  We call on Mr. Bright to 
unconditionally apologize to Bob Recine, and all people with disability, to 
resign his Housing Authority seat, and to reflect personally on the source 
of his contrary and divisive ideas.

At the same time, we reject the venomous threat (Home News Tribune) 
attributed to Middlesex County Surrogate, Kevin J. Hoagland, that "Frank 
Bright is a cancer in this society that we need to cut out", to the 
"applause" of Mayor Cahill's supporters.  Mr. Bright needs to be severely 
criticized, and attempts made to rehabilitate him.  But to incite physical 
harm is beyond irresponsible for any public officer, and we call on county 
officials to remove Mr. Hoagland from his own official position, if only to 
protect themselves from liability.

The people of New Brunswick have long suffered in an atmosphere of 
negativity and hostility to their needs.  The Peoples' Campaign recognizes 
the dire need for strong, positive, political leadership, and se see in this 
episode an opportunity, to first criticize our own personal faults and 
errors, but also to develop in our community a zero-tolerance stance toward 
negative, anti-social attitudes and the backward political philosophies 
which drive them.

Subject:Free all the Detainees! Protest Saturday, October 12<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Free All the detainees!
Our basic rights are in danger. A year after 9/11, the Bush administration
continues to hold hundreds of people in detention without charges or trial
and more are being rounded up every day.  The names of the detainees are
being kept secret.  We do know that several hundred are being held in jails
in New Jersey, New York and elsewhere in the US and 500 more at Guantanamo
Bay.  While almost all of the detainees are foreign-born, two, Jose Padilla
and Yassir Hamdi, are native-born US citizens.  Not one of the detainees has
been charged with a crime.

 Who is a detainee?  A detainee is anyone held by the US government who has
not been charged with a crime.  Such detentions are in violation of the Bill
of Rights which forbids deprivation of liberty without a charge brought by a
Grand Jury.

The Bush Administration now claims the right to detain anyone, anywhere in
the world and to hold them without charges indefinitely. The Administration
started out by detaining what they think is an easy target - men from Muslim
countries who are undocumented aliens.  But that is only the thin edge of
the wedge.  Anyone could be next.  THE USA-PATRIOT Act allows deportation
without trial of ANY non-citizen deemed by the President to be a terrorist.

Don't believe citizens are beyond the reach of this new policy either. In
court papers the Administration officially states that for the duration of
the "war on terrorism", the President, as Commander in Chief, can direct US
military personnel to detain ANYONE, ANYWHERE in the world, and be beyond
any judicial challenge in any court on any grounds. It asserts that the
President, in this global, unending "war" has authority to detain any
"individuals" he pleases, term them "enemy combatants", and imprison them
for life without trial.   No charges would ever be brought and no judge
would ever hear the case.

In simple terms, this "Bush doctrine" means that military police could come
to your door anywhere in the US, or in the world, "detain" you and hold you
indefinitely without charge or trial.

Despite the Bush administration's lies, the detentions in the US and at
Guantanamo Bay are in flagrant violation of the most basic rights guaranteed
to all, whether US citizens or not. The Sixth Amendment in the Bill of Right
states that ALL accused are entitled to "speedy and public trial", to know
the nature of the charges against them, to have the assistance of counsel,
in short to have all the rights that the detainees are now denied.

The Government has no proof that any of those detained are terrorists. If it
had, it would charge them with these crimes. But it has not charged one. The
real reason for these detentions is to get American s to accept the idea
that the government has the right to lock people up for whatever reason it
chooses, or for no reason at all.

All people in this country must unite together in opposition to our rights
being stripped away.  We have a long tradition of civil rights movements
demanding that the Government abide by the Bill of Rights.  Today we must
stand together - workers, students, immigrants - and demand that the
detentions stop immediately.

We must stop this attack on our rights, while we still have them! We must
stop the detentions now, when there are hundreds in the detention camps, not
hundred of thousands. We demand that ALL the detainees be freed, NOW!

 Hands off our Rights! Free All the Detainees!

Jailed Vieques Protester Released

.c The Associated Press

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - An activist jailed for six months for
trespassing on a Navy bombing range in Vieques was released Monday, and said 
he would keep protesting the U.S. military presence on the Puerto Rican 
island.

Leaving the federal prison in San Juan, Robert Rabin said would enter the 
bombing range again to stop the Navy from dropping ordnance. The Navy has 
only dropped dummy bombs since 1999.

Jail ``was a rich experience for my learning,'' Rabin said before returning 
to Vieques, where he has lived since 1980. ``I was jailed for my fight in 
Vieques, and I leave even more committed to the fight in Vieques.''

President Bush has said the Navy will leave the bombing range by May 2003. 
Gov. Sila Calderon and several U.S. lawmakers want the president to put the 
promise in writing.

Rabin, born in Boston, runs an art gallery in Vieques and helped lead a 
group opposed to the U.S. presence on the island. The group was created in 
the 1970s and gained widespread support in Puerto Rico after two errant 
bombs killed a civilian guard on the range in 1999.

The movement won world attention when protesters invaded the range and 
camped there for a year.

Bombing opponents claim the exercises pose a health threat, which the Navy 
denies.

The Navy, which owns about a third of the island, has used the bombing range 
for about 60 years to train its Atlantic fleet.

Declaration of Robert Rabin upon release from Federal Prison in Puerto Rico

Shalom.  Peace for all.  Thanks to Nilda, to my parents, to the beautifull 
Viequense-Puerto Rican people, for they are the manifestations of God who, 
from outside the prison, fed my spirit during difficult moments and served 
as a continuous reminder of the purpose of this imprisonment.  Thanks to the 
other prisoners - the Vieques civil disobedientes and especially, the 
solidarity from the humble, dignified men of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, 
Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, Cuba - from this Caribbean invaded and in 
constant resistence; and to those who arrived from Asia, Africa and Europe 
seeking peace, only to find themselves shackled by this government of blood 
and violence.  These men are also manifestations of God - and God is 
punished, humilliated and tortured in MDC Guaynabo.

So that the bankers and their families in the United States can live in 
exaggerated abundance, the sons and daughters of the Caribbean must throw 
themselves to the sharks.  So that the oil barons of New York, Washington 
and Texas might fill their pockets with money, the children of Asia and 
Africa must die of hunger.  So that Bush and his friends can kill innocent 
people in Irak and Afghanistan - who are also children of God - the children 
of Vieques must die of cancer.

The struggle for peace on Vieques is the struggle for world peace.  In 
Vieques they perfect their aim to perforate houses in Cisjordania, to kill 
women in the desert, to mutilate peace on the planet.  We must continue our 
work for peace, for love, for the things of God.

Peace for Vieques, Peace for the World!

URGENT ACTION 10/7/02:
Farouk Abdel-Muhti and Conditions at Passaic County Jail

Farouk Abdel-Muhti is a Palestinian activist who was arrested by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on Apr. 26 of this year.
Supporters believe he was targeted for his effective media work around
Palestinian rights. He has been held at three different county jails in New
Jersey since his arrest. Conditions are terrible at all the jails: the INS
detainees suffer from a complete absence of medical care, awful food,
crowded conditions and frequent abuses and humiliations at the hands of
prison guards and INS officials.

Starting at around 3am on Wednesday, Oct. 2, the INS made Farouk collect his
belongings, take his money out of the commissary and check out of Passaic
County Jail. He was not told where he was being taken. Many other detainees
witnessed the move.

Farouk was taken with several other detainees in a closed van which picked
up more detainees from Hudson County Jail before traveling to various
consulates in Manhattan to try to get them travel documents to facilitate
their deportation. The detainees were not allowed to dress appropriately for
the trip, and they were kept in extremely high temperatures in the
unventilated van throughout the day. After returning to New Jersey, the INS
tried to leave Farouk at Hudson County Jail, but the deportation
officer--after receiving a concerned phone
call from the paralegal working on Farouk's case--made them return Farouk to
Passaic instead.

The Committee for the Release of Farouk Abdel-Muhti urges all supporters of
human rights to call or fax INS New Jersey District Director Andrea
Quarantillo (phone 973-645-4421, fax 973-297-4848) immediately to demand:

1) Release Farouk Abdel-Muhti immediately. He is a stateless Palestinian 
whois not deportable, and he has been in jail almost six months. Like the
majority of the INS detainees, he is neither a threat to society nor a
flight risk. Arbitrary administrative detention makes a mockery of our
justice system. The INS should free all the detainees.

2) Stop the arbitrary transfers of detainees. If the INS wants to move a
detainee, it should first inform the detainee and his or her legal counsel,
and provide justification for the move.

3) Stop overcrowding the county jails, and take responsibility for improving
conditions. The INS seems to be deliberately overcrowding Passaic in an
effort to make conditions there so miserable that detainees would be forced
to accept deportation, even to a country where their lives may be at risk.
When detainees complain about conditions, don't just move them to another
jail--fix the problems!

4) Let INS detainees use public phones which allow them to access toll-free
numbers, outside of the costly "prison collect" phone system. Why should
MCI-Worldcom get $25 every time a detainee needs to talk to family members
or report a new injustice?

Please make your call or send your fax TODAY.

Congress is ultimately responsible for our country's immigration policies,
so contact your senators and representative during this election campaign
period: let them know you oppose INS detention and the stepped-up
immigration enforcement measures imposed since Sept. 11, 2001. Tell them:
these discriminatory policies waste our tax dollars and don't make us any
safer. In fact, they are a threat to the principles of freedom and justice
for which this country claims to stand.

Unraveling the mystery of
A man detained

Tuesday, October 08, 2002

PATERSON

Farouk Abdel-Muhti was still being held in the Passaic County
Jail Monday night, detained on immigration violations.

But not even the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service is
always certain of his whereabouts.

For the 55-year-old Palestinian, his nearly six-month detention,
his constant relocation and the confusion over his whereabouts is
not governmental ineptitude, but a conspiracy to curb his First
Amendment rights.

Abdel-Muhti is one of the 2,000-plus Muslim men with immigration
violations who were arrested and detained by the INS in response
to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He is being detained on an
outstanding 1995 deportation order, but there have been no
criminal charges filed against him. A self-proclaimed activist
for the rights of Palestinian people, Abdel-Muhti charged in an
interview that the INS arrested him to squelch public debate
about Palestinian rights and has kept him in detention since
April, because he refused to cooperate with federal authorities.

"(The INS) wants me to shut my mouth, they want to keep any
Palestinian from talking about his rights," said Abdel-Muhti.
"They told me, 'If you don't cooperate, we're going to send you
to Israel, to the Mossad.' "

INS officials adamantly denied any punitive measures against the
detainee for expressing his opinions.

"Decisions about detention operations are made based on a variety
of operational criteria and concerns. These may often include
availability of bed space, anticipated operational needs, etc,"
wrote Andrea Quarantillo, district director for the INS in
Newark, in a faxed letter to this newspaper. She added,
"Nevertheless, retribution is not and has never been a
consideration in determining where detainee(s) may be housed."

Since his arrest, on April 26 of this year, Abdel-Muhti has been
moved three times, between Camden, Middlesex and Passaic jails,
and he believes that if he continues his criticism of INS policy,
he will continue to be moved around - perhaps to Louisiana, away
from his family and his network of supporters, one supporter
said.

"There's been a lot of mobilizing around Farouk and with protest
(planned) in front of the Passaic County Jail on Oct. 12, if the
INS wants to diffuse that, they could move him out of New
Jersey," said Jeannette Gabriel, a friend and one of the protest
organizers.

Recently, the Herald News requested an interview with the
Palestinian detainee from the INS, after he contacted the
newspaper from a jail phone.

Although the INS did not deny the request, the agency repeatedly
told the newspaper that the detainee was being held in the Camden
County Jail. During phone conversations with Abdel-Muhti, he said
he was in the Passaic County Jail.

After the newspaper pointed out the agency's error in locating
Abdel-Muhti, INS officials refused to concede, and on Sept. 17,
Quarantillo wrote: "Mr. Abdel-Muhti is detained, and has been for
some time, in the Camden County Jail."

Only after a letter from Abdel-Muhti's attorney, Joel R.
Kupferman, did the agency finally agree that he was being held in
Passaic and rescheduled the newspaper's interview.

The interview took place in Passaic County Jail's glass-enclosed
visitors' room on the morning of Sept. 20.

In correspondence both before and after the interview, the INS
refused to address reasons behind their insistence that Abdel-
Muhti was in Camden County Jail.

A member of the Palestine Aid Society, Palestine National
Alliance and the Palestine Education Committee, Abdel-Muhti has
also organized and participated in several protests and peace
rallies. He lived for several years in Central America and speaks
fluent Spanish. Gabriel said that Abdel-Muhti has helped bridge
the Latino and Middle Eastern communities in New York City. It is
also the reason that he might have been targeted for arrest,
supporters said.

Another reason they cite is his vast network of contacts in the
Palestinian community in the United States and in the Middle
East.

"He knows people all over the place. If you wanted to talk to the
mayor of Nablus or the mayor of Jericho, Farouk was the one to
call," said Bernie McFall, a friend who was sharing his apartment
in Queens with Abdel-Muhti and his son when authorities arrested
him.

In March 2002, as the second intifada started to heat up, Abdel-
Muhti began to call upon those contacts to express their views on
the radio. At that time, he was working for WBAI radio in New
York, arranging interviews with Palestinian leaders for the
morning radio show Your Wake Up Call. .

Abdel-Muhti was up and out the door early in the morning to
prepare for the drive-time show. He was not at home the first
time the INS came knocking.

On Tuesday, April 9th, according to McFall, federal and city law
enforcement agents first came to the apartment looking for the
Palestinian.

McFall said that after he told them Abdel-Muhti was out, they
became abusive and threatening.

"(The agents) said that I was a disgrace to the American people,
that he wanted to throw me out the window," said McFall.

After the first visit from police, Abdel-Muhti consulted with his
lawyer and decided it would be better to offer to sit down with
the agents in their office, with his lawyer present. But the
offer was ignored, according to both Abdel-Muhti and McFall.

Abdel-Muhti went back to work at the radio station and continued
the radio show, focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

On April 26, at 5 a.m., authorities came knocking again. This
time, Abdel-Muhti was home and they were insistent on speaking
with him, according to McFall. After a brief standoff with
authorities, who, McFall said, never provided a search warrant,
Abdel-Muhti was taken to 26 Federal Plaza, New York City, where
authorities made him an offer.

"They told me, 'If you cooperate with us, we will help you - get
you out,'" Abdel-Muhti said.

They offered to give him favorable treatment in exchange for a
list of Palestinian aid organizations and the people who
supported them, he said.

"You are playing with my dignity, you are playing with my
principles," he said he told them.

After he refused, the agents became angry and beat him, Abdel-
Muhti said.

He was then taken to the Middlesex County Correctional Facility,
where he said he was held until July 15.

Abdel-Muhti said that he was moved, because protests organized
both inside and outside the jail became a headache to the warden.

He was moved to the Camden County Correctional Facility, where,
again, he became an unwelcome presence, Abdel-Muhti and his

supporters said. He was moved to the Passaic jail on Sept 5, he
said.

"It appears that the transfer to Passaic was in retaliation for
Farouk's constant advocacy on behalf of himself and other
detainees," wrote David Wilson, one of Abdel-Muhti's leading
supporters, in a recent e-mail.

Immigrants' rights advocates have long accused the INS of
punishing detainees, especially post-Sept. 11 detainees, for
speaking to the press and criticizing the agency. But rarely are
they able to provide concrete evidence.

Abdel-Muhti and his supporters point to his relocations as proof
of retaliation. But the INS is a large bureaucracy that has a
reputation for snafus. Earlier this year, several INS officials
were reassigned after student visa approval notices were sent to
two of the Sept. 11 high-jackers six months after the attack.

On Oct. 2, Abdel-Muhti said, he was taken to the Honduran
Consulate, to see if he could be deported to that country.
Because he is not Honduran, the consulate refused to accept him
and he was taken back to the jail, he said. This time he was
admitted as Farouk Mahmoud, he said. Although he
protested that this was not his name, the jail has yet to change
it, he said.

Abdel-Muhti is not the only one to suffer from clerical errors
surrounding detention, said Mohamed Shaaban Seif, another
immigrant inmate detained at Passaic County Jail. In a recent
phone interview, Seif said he had been given the name Mohamed
Jhaaban.

On her first visit, Seif's wife, Rebekah, was turned away,
because the INS had recorded his name incorrectly, and because
she had arrived, 13-month-old baby in tow, on the wrong night,
said the couple.

Visitations are scheduled by last names on different days of the
week.

But Rebekah Seif said it's just the way the immigration service
operates.

"Honestly, dealing with INS is a problem," she said. "The system
is hard. It takes a lot of time and it needs a lot of work."

Subject:NJ: NO TO WAR! OCTOBER 24, 4 PM<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Please Forward!!!!!

Across the country and around the world, in communities, towns and schools,
people are coming together to take a stand for justice: to say that blood
shall not be spilled in a quest for empire and oil. On October 24, 2002, the
people of New Jersey must take a stand to join in that call!

We will say that endless war against the world shall not take place in our
names; that we say NO to war with Iraq; that we say NO to bombing Vieques;
that we say NO to the occupation and oppression of Palestine! We say YES to
unity, to resistance, to struggle and to liberation---to making our voices
heard against unjust war and oppression around the world.

As we protest, as we speak, US bombs are being prepared to fall on Iraq.
These bombs have been falling, repeatedly, since the end of the Gulf War in
1991. The onslaught on the Iraqi people has never been lifted; bombs and
sanctions have marked a wide swath of misery through Iraq.

As we protest, as we speak, US bombs are falling on Vieques. Puerto Rican
land, long an area of colonialization, is also a testing ground for depleted
uranium, for dangerous weapons that kill Puerto Ricans in order to provide a
more effective means for killing Iraqis.

As we protest, as we speak, US-made fighter planes are buzzing over the Gaza
Strip and West Bank, dropping US-made bombs and missiles on the people of
Palestine. The Israeli government engages in its occupation and oppression
of the Palestinian people with the money and weapons provided them by the
US government. The monstrous injustice and dispossession visited upon
Palestine by
the US and its Israeli client are brutal attacks designed to eliminate a
population.

In Colombia, in the Philippines, in Afghanistan, in the Sudan, in
Yugoslavia,
the US military and US weapons have killed and continue to kill thousands
and
dispossess millions. We must take a stand to say that these wars are
unacceptable,
that the American people wish for something better than death and
destruction,
for ourselves, our children, and our fellow humanity around the world. We
demand more: we demand justice.

We demand justice in our own nation for all of its residents. We demand the
protection and expansion of our civil liberties. We demand that the Iraqi
people not be killed in a quest of greed. We demand an end to the use of
Puerto Rican land as a bombing range for the US military. We demand an end
to US aid to Israel and support for the liberation struggle of the
Palestinian people.
We demand change, and we stand for action!

Indonesian cleric charged in church bombings 

Officials have linked Abu Bakar Bashir to Al Qaeda terror network 

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP-CP) -- Indonesia today arrested the spiritual leader of a militant Islamic group suspected in last week's Bali nightclub bombing and blamed the attack on Al Qaeda and its allies in Southeast Asia.

Defence Minister Matori Abdul Djalil said the cleric, Abu Bakar Bashir, was linked to Al Qaeda and that his right-hand man, known as Hambali, was behind many of the country's terrorist bombings.

Matori stopped short of accusing Bashir of organizing the Bali attack, but said that it was logical to believe that Hambali, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, helped orchestrate them and that Bashir knew about it.

The two men are accused of being leaders of Jemaah Islamiyah, Al Qaeda's biggest ally in Southeast Asia.

Hambali is one of the region's most-wanted figures. He is accused of arranging a meeting of two of the Sept. 11 hijackers with other Al Qaeda figures in Malaysia in January 2000 and was behind an alleged plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy and other western targets in Singapore.

"Al Qaeda and its internal network is behind this Bali bomb blast," Matori told a news conference in Bali, a week after bombs tore through a nightclub district and killed at least 183 people and injured more than 300, mostly foreign tourists. Four Canadians were injured in the blast and another is missing.

"A lot of information and the progress of our intelligence work confirm that Hambali is Abu Bakar Bashir's vice-chairman," Matori said. "Hambali is a terrorist from Indonesia. He's always been mentioned by those who did bombings in the past as their commander."

"It is illogical if Abu Bakar Bashir says that he doesn't know about the bombings in Indonesia," Matori said.

Bashir, 64, hospitalized since Friday with breathing problems, is under police guard at the main hospital in his home town of Solo in the western part of Indonesia's main island of Java.

Saturday afternoon, authorities sent police doctors to Solo to determine if Bashir is healthy enough to travel to Jakarta.

"The police don't believe he is sick," said National Police spokesman Gen. Saleh Saaf. "He might be pretending."

Bashir, who runs an Islamic school, has not been named as a suspect in the Bali attacks. His arrest Saturday stemmed from his alleged connection to a spate of church bombings Dec. 24, 2000, in which 19 people died. He has denied involvement in those attacks as well as the Bali bombings.

The carnage in Bali triggered international demands that Indonesia -- the world's most populous Muslim country -- crack down on extremists and militants allegedly linked to al-Qaida.

Warning of the threat of new attacks, Australia urged its citizens to leave Indonesia, saying areas in Jakarta could be hit. The United States, which has evacuated 350 diplomats and dependants, advised Americans to put off travel to the country. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa issued a similar travel bulletin for Canadians on Friday. People have also been advised to avoid crowded areas frequented by foreigners.

President Megawati Sukarnoputri, slow to act against religious militancy in the past because of Islamic sensitivities, on Friday rammed through emergency measures by decree after months of legislative delay. It was made retroactive to cover those responsible for the Bali bombing.

"After what happened in Bali, Indonesia urgently needs a law to fight terrorism," Justice Minister Yusril Mahendra said.

The decree allows for suspects to be detained initially for three days. With a judge's approval, that can be extended by another six months without charge. Those convicted of carrying out or threatening acts of terror will face prison sentences ranging from four years to life or the death penalty.

The measures will be enforced by the police. Many human rights activists are leery of wider powers for the Indonesian military, which has a long record of brutal abuses. Human Rights Watch warned that the decree could lead to abuses due to the weak judiciary and rampant corruption.

Police Brig.-Gen. Edward Aritonang said in Bali that investigators had questioned 67 people about the nightclub blasts, but said there were no formal suspects.

More than 100 foreign investigators from Australia, the United States, France, Germany and Japan are working in Bali. They expect to reopen the blast site to the public Wednesday.

Bashir is likely to be released from Muhammadiyah Hospital in two days, doctors said. Police officials told reporters that questioning would be postponed until then.

It was unclear what would happen to Bashir afterward, but options include confining him to Solo -- between his home and the hospital -- under police supervision, or taking him to a police hospital in Jakarta.

Several dozen riot policemen were posted at the hospital to prevent Bashir's students from mounting street protests.

Indonesia has been under international pressure to arrest Bashir for months. The government, fearing an Islamic extremist backlash, balked and said there was not enough evidence.

Officials changed their position Friday after a team of Indonesian investigators returned from questioning Omar al-Faruq, an alleged al-Qaida operative in Southeast Asia who was arrested in Indonesia and turned over to the United States in June.

Al-Faruq fingered Bashir as ordering the church bombings, and implicated him in the activities of Jemaah Islamiyah. Bashir said he does not know al-Faruq.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP-CP) -- Indonesia today arrested the spiritual leader of a militant Islamic group suspected in last week's Bali nightclub bombing and blamed the attack on Al Qaeda and its allies in Southeast Asia.

Defence Minister Matori Abdul Djalil said the cleric, Abu Bakar Bashir, was linked to Al Qaeda and that his right-hand man, known as Hambali, was behind many of the country's terrorist bombings.

Matori stopped short of accusing Bashir of organizing the Bali attack, but said that it was logical to believe that Hambali, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, helped orchestrate them and that Bashir knew about it.

The two men are accused of being leaders of Jemaah Islamiyah, Al Qaeda's biggest ally in Southeast Asia.

Hambali is one of the region's most-wanted figures. He is accused of arranging a meeting of two of the Sept. 11 hijackers with other Al Qaeda figures in Malaysia in January 2000 and was behind an alleged plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy and other western targets in Singapore.

"Al Qaeda and its internal network is behind this Bali bomb blast," Matori told a news conference in Bali, a week after bombs tore through a nightclub district and killed at least 183 people and injured more than 300, mostly foreign tourists. Four Canadians were injured in the blast and another is missing.

"A lot of information and the progress of our intelligence work confirm that Hambali is Abu Bakar Bashir's vice-chairman," Matori said. "Hambali is a terrorist from Indonesia. He's always been mentioned by those who did bombings in the past as their commander."

"It is illogical if Abu Bakar Bashir says that he doesn't know about the bombings in Indonesia," Matori said.

Bashir, 64, hospitalized since Friday with breathing problems, is under police guard at the main hospital in his home town of Solo in the western part of Indonesia's main island of Java.

Saturday afternoon, authorities sent police doctors to Solo to determine if Bashir is healthy enough to travel to Jakarta.

"The police don't believe he is sick," said National Police spokesman Gen. Saleh Saaf. "He might be pretending."

Bashir, who runs an Islamic school, has not been named as a suspect in the Bali attacks. His arrest Saturday stemmed from his alleged connection to a spate of church bombings Dec. 24, 2000, in which 19 people died. He has denied involvement in those attacks as well as the Bali bombings.

The carnage in Bali triggered international demands that Indonesia -- the world's most populous Muslim country -- crack down on extremists and militants allegedly linked to al-Qaida.

Warning of the threat of new attacks, Australia urged its citizens to leave Indonesia, saying areas in Jakarta could be hit. The United States, which has evacuated 350 diplomats and dependants, advised Americans to put off travel to the country. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa issued a similar travel bulletin for Canadians on Friday. People have also been advised to avoid crowded areas frequented by foreigners.

President Megawati Sukarnoputri, slow to act against religious militancy in the past because of Islamic sensitivities, on Friday rammed through emergency measures by decree after months of legislative delay. It was made retroactive to cover those responsible for the Bali bombing.

"After what happened in Bali, Indonesia urgently needs a law to fight terrorism," Justice Minister Yusril Mahendra said.

The decree allows for suspects to be detained initially for three days. With a judge's approval, that can be extended by another six months without charge. Those convicted of carrying out or threatening acts of terror will face prison sentences ranging from four years to life or the death penalty.

The measures will be enforced by the police. Many human rights activists are leery of wider powers for the Indonesian military, which has a long record of brutal abuses. Human Rights Watch warned that the decree could lead to abuses due to the weak judiciary and rampant corruption.

Police Brig.-Gen. Edward Aritonang said in Bali that investigators had questioned 67 people about the nightclub blasts, but said there were no formal suspects.

More than 100 foreign investigators from Australia, the United States, France, Germany and Japan are working in Bali. They expect to reopen the blast site to the public Wednesday.

Bashir is likely to be released from Muhammadiyah Hospital in two days, doctors said. Police officials told reporters that questioning would be postponed until then.

It was unclear what would happen to Bashir afterward, but options include confining him to Solo -- between his home and the hospital -- under police supervision, or taking him to a police hospital in Jakarta.

Several dozen riot policemen were posted at the hospital to prevent Bashir's students from mounting street protests.

Indonesia has been under international pressure to arrest Bashir for months. The government, fearing an Islamic extremist backlash, balked and said there was not enough evidence.

Officials changed their position Friday after a team of Indonesian investigators returned from questioning Omar al-Faruq, an alleged al-Qaida operative in Southeast Asia who was arrested in Indonesia and turned over to the United States in June.

Al-Faruq fingered Bashir as ordering the church bombings, and implicated him in the activities of Jemaah Islamiyah. Bashir said he does not know al-Faruq.

"A lot of information and the progress of our intelligence work confirm that Hambali is Abu Bakar Bashir's vice-chairman," Matori said. "Hambali is a terrorist from Indonesia. He's always been mentioned by those who did bombings in the past as their commander."

"It is illogical if Abu Bakar Bashir says that he doesn't know about the bombings in Indonesia," Matori said.

Bashir, 64, hospitalized since Friday with breathing problems, is under police guard at the main hospital in his home town of Solo in the western part of Indonesia's main island of Java.

Saturday afternoon, authorities sent police doctors to Solo to determine if Bashir is healthy enough to travel to Jakarta.

"The police don't believe he is sick," said National Police spokesman Gen. Saleh Saaf. "He might be pretending."

Bashir, who runs an Islamic school, has not been named as a suspect in the Bali attacks. His arrest Saturday stemmed from his alleged connection to a spate of church bombings Dec. 24, 2000, in which 19 people died. He has denied involvement in those attacks as well as the Bali bombings.

The carnage in Bali triggered international demands that Indonesia -- the world's most populous Muslim country -- crack down on extremists and militants allegedly linked to al-Qaida.

Warning of the threat of new attacks, Australia urged its citizens to leave Indonesia, saying areas in Jakarta could be hit. The United States, which has evacuated 350 diplomats and dependants, advised Americans to put off travel to the country. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa issued a similar travel bulletin for Canadians on Friday. People have also been advised to avoid crowded areas frequented by foreigners.

President Megawati Sukarnoputri, slow to act against religious militancy in the past because of Islamic sensitivities, on Friday rammed through emergency measures by decree after months of legislative delay. It was made retroactive to cover those responsible for the Bali bombing.

"After what happened in Bali, Indonesia urgently needs a law to fight terrorism," Justice Minister Yusril Mahendra said.

The decree allows for suspects to be detained initially for three days. With a judge's approval, that can be extended by another six months without charge. Those convicted of carrying out or threatening acts of terror will face prison sentences ranging from four years to life or the death penalty.

The measures will be enforced by the police. Many human rights activists are leery of wider powers for the Indonesian military, which has a long record of brutal abuses. Human Rights Watch warned that the decree could lead to abuses due to the weak judiciary and rampant corruption.

Police Brig.-Gen. Edward Aritonang said in Bali that investigators had questioned 67 people about the nightclub blasts, but said there were no formal suspects.

More than 100 foreign investigators from Australia, the United States, France, Germany and Japan are working in Bali. They expect to reopen the blast site to the public Wednesday.

Bashir is likely to be released from Muhammadiyah Hospital in two days, doctors said. Police officials told reporters that questioning would be postponed until then.

It was unclear what would happen to Bashir afterward, but options include confining him to Solo -- between his home and the hospital -- under police supervision, or taking him to a police hospital in Jakarta.

Several dozen riot policemen were posted at the hospital to prevent Bashir's students from mounting street protests.

Indonesia has been under international pressure to arrest Bashir for months. The government, fearing an Islamic extremist backlash, balked and said there was not enough evidence.

Officials changed their position Friday after a team of Indonesian investigators returned from questioning Omar al-Faruq, an alleged al-Qaida operative in Southeast Asia who was arrested in Indonesia and turned over to the United States in June.

Al-Faruq fingered Bashir as ordering the church bombings, and implicated him in the activities of Jemaah Islamiyah. Bashir said he does not know al-Faruq.

Indonesian cleric charged in church bombings 

Officials have linked Abu Bakar Bashir to Al Qaeda terror network 

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP-CP) -- Indonesia today arrested the spiritual leader of a militant Islamic group suspected in last week's Bali nightclub bombing and blamed the attack on Al Qaeda and its allies in Southeast Asia.

Defence Minister Matori Abdul Djalil said the cleric, Abu Bakar Bashir, was linked to Al Qaeda and that his right-hand man, known as Hambali, was behind many of the country's terrorist bombings.

Matori stopped short of accusing Bashir of organizing the Bali attack, but said that it was logical to believe that Hambali, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, helped orchestrate them and that Bashir knew about it.

The two men are accused of being leaders of Jemaah Islamiyah, Al Qaeda's biggest ally in Southeast Asia.

Hambali is one of the region's most-wanted figures. He is accused of arranging a meeting of two of the Sept. 11 hijackers with other Al Qaeda figures in Malaysia in January 2000 and was behind an alleged plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy and other western targets in Singapore.

"Al Qaeda and its internal network is behind this Bali bomb blast," Matori told a news conference in Bali, a week after bombs tore through a nightclub district and killed at least 183 people and injured more than 300, mostly foreign tourists. Four Canadians were injured in the blast and another is missing.

<pre>israeli nazis, or zionazi pigs and toilet scum

A funny thing happened in Iran the other day. The official
Iranian news agency, IRNA, published a poll on Iranian
attitudes toward America, conducted by Iran's National
Institute for Research Studies and Opinion Polls. The poll
asked 1,500 Iranians whether they favored opening talks
with America, and 75 percent said "yes." More interesting,
46 percent said U.S. policies on Iran - which include an
economic boycott and labeling Iran part of an "axis of
evil" - were "to some extent correct." 

Oops! 

You can imagine what happened next. Iran's hard-liners shut
down the polling institute and threatened the IRNA official
who published the results. Never mind. The fact that the
hard-liners had to do such a thing shows how out of touch
they are with Iran's courageous mainstream. 

I relate this incident because it is very useful in
thinking about the task of democratic transition in the
Middle East. The Arab and Muslim worlds today are largely
dominated by autocratic regimes. If you want to know what
it would look like for them to move from autocracy to
democracy, check out Iran. In many countries it will
involve an Iranian-like mixture of theocracy and democracy,
in which the Islamists initially win power by the ballot
box, but then can't deliver the jobs and rising living
standards that their young people desire, so they come
under popular pressure and can only hold on to power by
force. 

But eventually they will lose, because the young generation
in Iran today knows two things: (1) They've had enough
democracy to know they want more of it. (2) They've had
enough theocracy crammed down their throats to know they
want less of it. Eventually, they will force a new balance
in Iran, involving real democracy and an honored place for
Islam, but not an imposed one. 

But why is it taking so long? Why isn't Iran like Poland or
Hungary after the fall of the Berlin Wall? And why might
Iraq not be like them after the fall of Saddam? The answer
is spelled O-I-L. 

The transition from autocracy to real democracy in Iran is
dragged out much longer than in Europe for many reasons,
but the most important is because the hard-line mullahs
control Iran's oil wealth. What that means is that they
have a pool of money that they can use to monopolize all
the instruments of coercion - the army, police and
intelligence services. And their pool of money is not
dependent on their opening Iran's economy or political
system or being truly responsive to their people's
aspirations. 

Think of it like this: There are two ways for a government
to get rich in the Middle East. One is by drilling a sand
dune and the other is by drilling the talents,
intelligence, creativity and energy of its men and women.
As long as the autocratic leaders of Iran, Iraq or Saudi
Arabia can get rich by drilling their natural resources,
they can stay in power a long, long time. All they have to
do is capture control of the oil tap. Only when a
government has to drill its human resources will it
organize itself in a way that enables it to extract those
talents - with modern education, open trade, and freedom of
thought, of scientific enquiry and of the press. 

For all these reasons, if we really want to hasten the
transition from autocracy to something more democratic in
places like Iraq or Iran, the most important thing we can
do is gradually, but steadily, bring down the price of oil
- through conservation and alternative energies. 

I know that Dick Cheney thinks conservation is for sissies.
Real men send B-52's. But he's dead wrong. In the Middle
East, conservation and alternative energies are strategic
tools. Ronald Reagan helped bring down the Soviet Union by
using two tactics: he delegitimized the Soviets and he
defueled them. He delegitimized them by branding the Soviet
Union an "Evil Empire," and by exposing its youth to what
was going on elsewhere in the world, and he defueled them
by so outspending them on Star Wars that the Soviet Union
went bankrupt. In the Middle East today, the Bush team is
delegitimizing the worst regimes as an "axis of evil," but
it is doing nothing to defuel them. Just the opposite. We
refuel them with our big cars. 

Which was the first and only real Arab democracy? Lebanon.
Which Arab country had no oil? Lebanon. Which is the first
Arab oil state to turn itself into a constitutional
monarchy? Bahrain. Which is the first Arab oil state to run
out of oil? Bahrain. 

Ousting Saddam is necessary for promoting the spread of
democracy in the Middle East, but it won't be sufficient,
it won't stick, without the Mideast states kicking their
oil dependency and without us kicking ours.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hi, everyone!

I apologize to everyone for your misfortune in being on an email list with a
pro-Palestinian activist. Hundreds of activists have been forged, and spam
sent in their names, to numerous Yahoo! groups of which they are a part. As
Yahoo! checks only the content of the "from" line for membership rather than
the actual originating host, it's relatively easy for the forgeries to pass
through.

This article from Wired News gives an overview of the problem:
http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,54708,00.html

This has been an attempt to target pro-Palestinian activists. It usually
occurs on pro-Palestine-only lists, rather than in random places. I
sincerely hope the spammer has had his fun and will not return.

-Charlotte

The Serial Sniper has had once 

Condom-Lisa-Rise in his viewer 

and he did not shoot her. 

Not because he did not want to 

as much as that he was stunned 

by her ugliness, 

not her very obvious political-ugliness 

but rather her physical one. 



If I were to be a Sniper, 

I would have done a favor to many people 

especially to her husband. 



Before someone accuses me of "Hate-Mail" 

I insist to inform that I am not a "Sniper" 

and that my weapon is not a "gun" 





Back to Mrs. Condom-Lisa-Rice.... 

before anyone accuses me also 

as "Male-chauvinist" 

I ask you , who would ever make love 

to a person with such a face ?? 



Having said that , 

I would still forgive her ugly face 



What bothers me , is exactly , what bothers 

Harry Bellafonte who compared her to the 

"slaves still serving their Masters" 

100 years after Abe Lincoln 

noticed that America needs the Africans. 



I would not go so far as Harry Bellafonte 

but I would suggest that

would allow Codom-lisa as member....... 

How ? 

Very easy !! 

once she will wear their "uniform"

no one could tell 

how ugly her politics is. 

I guess Colin Powell could also join , as well.

Terror network growing in Asia, Australia 

SINGAPORE (CNN) --Intelligence officials say that Jemaah Islamiya -- a militant Islamic group suspected of having links to the bombings in Bali as well as recent attacks in the Philippines -- appears to have set up networks throughout Southeast Asia and Australia. 

Though the man alleged to be the group's spiritual leader, radical Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, has been arrested by Indonesian authorities, intelligence officials say a threat from the group still remains. 

The officials tell CNN they believe Ba'asyir's deputy and operations chief Riduan Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, is still directing operatives across the region from Indonesia. 

Singapore intelligence says Hambali is a long-time al Qaeda member who sits on the shura or consultative council of both al Qaeda and its regional network, the Jemaah Islamiya (JI). 

"The Jemaah Islamiya network is more or less the al Qaeda cell in Southeast Asia," Southeast Asian analysts Zachary Abuza says. 
Regional cells 

Regional intelligence documents obtained by CNN show operational cells, known as mantiqis, have carved out the region: 

Mantiqi 1 covers Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. 
Mantiqi 2 covers most of Indonesia. 
Mantiqi 3 is the Philippines, Brunei, east Malaysia and Kalimantan and Sulawesi in Indonesia. 
Mantiqi 4 operates in Australia and West Papua. 

However, sources say it is unclear whether the JI cells thought to have been set up inside Australia itself are for logistical support or if they are operational. 

Intelligence sources say they believe the nightclub involved in the Bali bombings was chosen because of the predominance of Australians among its clientele. 

Although he has been placed under arrest, Ba'asyir has not been linked to the Bali blasts, despite authorities' suspicions that his group is linked to the attack. 
Hybrid groups 

Intelligence officials say that three key al Qaeda operatives, working with JI, infiltrated and co-opted homegrown Muslim groups, like the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the Philippines or Laskar Jundullah in Indonesia. 

"They are plugging into the different extremist organizations in each country which may have its own agenda, but at the same time, they can work together to perpetrate these attacks," Concepcion Clamor from the Philippine National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) says. 

Regional intelligence sources tell CNN that these hybrid groups account for at least 12 tons of explosives missing in the region -- 4 tons from Malaysia, 4.6 tons in the Philippines and at least 4 tons from Indonesia. 

U.S. intelligence sources tell CNN a Saudi sheikh -- a pseudonym used by Osama Bin Laden -- wired $74,000 to Ba'asyir to purchase several tons of explosives. 

"It is very likely that a portion of that explosives was used to construct the device and the devices that were detonated in Bali," terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna says. 

Security experts say governments in the region need to work closely together to dismantle this existing network and find the missing explosives. 

If they delay, analysts warn, it will only be a matter of time before the next attack takes place. Find this article at:

People, Issues and Politics:  Talks with candidates for New
Brunswick mayor

Drumming to a different beat

Published 10/19/02
New Brunswick Spokesman/The Somerset Spectator

By MARK GRIECO
Staff writer

NEW BRUNSWICK � Even if you don't like his politics, it's
difficult
to not like the man, say some city residents.  He is, as his
campaign literature has assured the voters in four unsuccessful
mayoral elections, "the real deal", and now in his fifth mayoral
bid "the only deal".

He wears his heart on his sleeve, whether he's talking about his
Royal Unique Drill Team and Drum Corp, his blue-collar roots, or the
older cops, white and black, that watched over him as a kid on the
streets of New Brunswick and later mentored him when he joined their
ranks.

This is not a slick politician dispensing sound bytes with a sickly-
sweet smile. This is old-school and occasionally in your face
stuff: "The first order of business is to get rid of this Mayor
(that's one-time baseball teammate Mayor James Cahill)."  Yep, one
hundred per cent bona fide James Neal, 24-7.

"Kids want to get involved, you've got to find a way for them to do
that," he says.  He's talking in reference to his passion, the Royal
Unique Drill Team and Drum Corp, a nationally competing marching
band that he founded and has led for 20 years. "Instead of guns and
drugs, they have band practice. It improves their concentration and
they do better in school."

After some 45 minutes of watching marching band clips on his wide-
screen TV and being shown marching band catalogs,  I began to wonder
when we would talk about politics.  Typically, candidates want to
wow you with their wealth of knowledge of bond issues, housing, land
use planning, etc. � real wonk issues.

That's not Neal, this guy is about matters of the heart; pride,
dignity, community. He'll tell you frankly as mayor he can hire
experts to talk about the day-to-day running of the machinery of the
city.  Micro- management is not his gig, people are.

"A $51 million budget is not that big," he says.   "It just takes a
caring man. I'm people oriented. I'll listen to them. It's what the
people want, not what Neal wants."

A wall of his modest city home � located in a neighborhood rough
enough that he insisted I park my bicycle in his living room instead
of locking it outside � is filled with plaques commemorating his
work with the Uniques and other city youth.

Neal has financially backed the band on what he earns as a city
patrolman.  "My pension and paycheck go to the Uniques," he said.
Other funding comes from the kids asking for donations at the
intersection of Handy Street and Jersey Avenue.  Parents help, but
it's clear the band bears his philosophy.

He believes that given the chance, and some help, people will lift
themselves up from where they're at. Speaking of the kids in the
band  � some 80 kids a year are involved � he said, "It's
amazing.
They'll rise to the occasion if they're supported. Kids need
stability." Arguably, the Royal Unique experience is a model for
what he says he could do as mayor: lift people up.

A Mayor Neal?

Asked what a typical day in the life of a Mayor Neal would be like,
he's short on details of policy and comes back to what he believes
he knows best: people.

"I would be the best mayor," he said. "People would walk with their
heads up because they know I care."

This goes beyond being merely chipper, this is almost a spiritual
happiness he's talking about. "We'd have a world class city, not
just materially, the soul would be better."

He added, "I'd be busy helping folks... trying to get them jobs, a
place to stay, encouraging them to be better students."

The chance to build a shining city upon the hill, or in this case on
the banks of the Raritan, has eluded him four times � this is his
fifth run for mayor.  Conventional political wisdom would probably
say, "Give it up, already."

Critics have also said that once again, Neal's ticket � this time
it's Danny Rosado and Joe Smith for council against incumbents
Blanquita Valenti and Joseph Egan � will be splitting the anti-
incumbent vote.

Another independent ticket � mayoral candidate Keith Thomas is
challenging incumbent Mayor James Cahill, and council candidates
Benjamin Rivera and Kelley Stephenson round out Thomas's ticket �
have been grabbing the headlines lately with their rent leveling
petition and class action suit involving the mayor.  If controversy
is an indication of voter support, Thomas's ticket could well be the
front running challengers, say observers.

Already a political career

Neal is unfazed.  He's out-lived, politically speaking, other
challengers to Cahill , who accepted the torch of Democratic
leadership passed to him from the legendary Mayor John Lynch.  Neal
is the perennial challenger;  always losing, but always fighting.
He rattles off the names of people that have challenged the regular
Democrats, lost, then eventually dropped out of sight: Dave
Meiswinkle, Tom Clark, Mike Shapiro.

He doesn't mention them, but the list of council challengers �
the
regular Democrats have yet to lose a council seat in most residents'
life time � is certainly even longer and the names escapes most
residents' memories.

"I haven't failed, I've gained," says Neal. "Other people," he
claims as he shows me campaign literature from around the state,"
have stolen my ideas."

He adds,"I'm the one that can beat Cahill. I don't see Keith Thomas
as a threat. That's their [Thomas's slate] right to run. But if they
were sincere, they'd be behind me."

There's no doubt in his head who should be the front running
challenger: "I'm a legitimate candidate.  I've gotten votes. I've
been consistent for the last 16 years."

"Commitment is the key. My wife and I [Deborah] are committed to the
city," he said. "I'm out to win this election."

Neal, often animated and streetwise, has been around this city his
whole life. But he gets quiet, emotional, talking about his parents.
His dad was a truck driver and his mother was a domestic servant for
a family in Metuchen. They were a deacon and deaconess at their
church.  Mets fans, too.

Days gone by

Born and raised in the city, Neal remembers the days before the
nation's civil rights period.  The site where the Foodtown on
Livingston Avenue now sits was once a city swimming pool...for
whites only.

A star athlete at New Brunswick High School, and an African-
American, he often looked longingly at the pool as he walked home
from practice. When civil rights advances enforced African-
Americans' right to enter the pool, he claims it was promptly
demolished and a new one built in Milltown, then a virtually all-
white town.

According to Neal, not much is different today for city residents.
He points to what he describes as a failing school system, poor
housing, drugs on the city's streets � "all the major components
that rate a city" � and contends "little has changed."

He said, "If you look at the things that matter, the taxpayers will
agree with me."

Neal claims that most of the city's cops, firefighters, and
teachers, live outside the city.  That's something he would try to
change. "I'd provide grants for them to own homes in the city. If we
can give tax abatements to wealthy developers, we can give residents
respect and do the same," he says.

The city's police have been a major influence in his life. "I knew
all the cops as a kid, black and white. I guess that's why I'm one
now," says Neal, who has over 25 years on the force. "Older cops
inspired me to care about people.  If I was mayor, the Juvenile Aid
Bureau would be as important as the patrol division."

Anyone in the game as long as Neal has taken a few hits and had some
good days, too.  Asked about a personal low point, he gives me one
about the city as a whole: "I see the city continuing down the road
for the rich and the special interests and not for people that have
been living here for years."

High point? "Being there, bringing issues to the city. Putting a
smile on somebody's face when you're trying to help them. You try to
make a difference and they appreciate it."

If he should lose, then what?  "There's other races we can run like
freeholder ... assembly," he says.

Critics might point out that it would be difficult to see how after
losing several city races, he could be a viable candidate for larger
office.  Again, he is unfazed by what some might say is practical
politics.

"I'm older, my ego is not in this, my heart is."

<pre>Baraka's son to attend rally in New Brunswick

Published in the Home News Tribune 10/26/02
By SHARON WATERS
STAFF WRITER

NEW BRUNSWICK: Newark Deputy Mayor Ras Baraka, son of the state's poet 
laureate, will attend a People's Campaign rally today and decide whether to 
endorse the slate of independent candidates.

The rally will be held today at Feaster Park on Throop Avenue from 1 to 3 
p.m. The People's Campaign ticket includes mayoral candidate James Neal and 
City Council candidates Danny Rosado and Joe Smith.

Baraka is the son of New Jersey's poet laureate Amiri Baraka, who made 
headlines recently when some lines in one of his poems were viewed as 
anti-Semitic. The father rebuffed the governor's request to resign.

Smith supported Baraka in his run for Newark City Council, as did members of 
New Brunswick United, a second set of independent candidates. Both groups 
want Baraka's endorsement.

Keith V. Thomas, mayoral candidate with New Brunswick United, said his 
campaign would like to be endorsed by Baraka but won't push the issue. 
Thomas is running with council candidates Benjamin Rivera and Kelley 
Stephenson.

"I intend to come down there and see what's going on," said Ras Baraka about 
the rally.

The independents face Democratic incumbents Mayor Jim Cahill and council 
members Joseph V. Egan and Blanquita Valenti.

"The people of New Brunswick are the ones who will decide this election, not 
a politician coming in from Newark," said city spokesman Edward Bray.

Subject:why wont cahill debate?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>New Brunswick Peoples� Campaign 2002

Why Won�t Cahill Debate?

To the Editor:

New Brunswick Mayor James Cahill says he has no time to debate challenger 
James Neal before the November 5 election.  This must be because Cahill 
knows how long it would take to explain his corrupt, backward 
administration.

Corporate slogans and glossy brochures don�t take much time for Mayor 
Cahill, but how would he quickly answer �Why was the mayor a key character 
witness for convicted pimps, James Marshall and Marco Chinchilla, who held 
high rank on his police force?�  Testimony shows one of their brothels was 
on Paterson St., around the corner from Cahill�s City Hall.

Cahill must not have been so pressed for time that day in court, but it 
might take a minute to explain �Why did his appointed police chief, Michael 
Beltranena, quit the force within a month of the guilty verdict, to take a 
job in Montgomery?�  �Why did his police force offer a $10,000 reward for 
the capture of a fabricated Young Black Male suspect, after dirty 
detectives, Marshall and Chinchilla, staged a Remsen Ave. neighborhood 
shoot-out, in order to file for early retirement to avoid their prostitution 
prosecution?�

Cahill must not have time to explain why his appointed board of education 
produces the worst test scores in Middlesex County, with only 12% of Lincoln 
School 4th graders passing their recent statewide proficiency tests, and 
only 51% of New Brunswick High School 11th graders passed the HSPT, required 
for graduation.

Cahill may need time to explain why his aides, like Kevin Jones, pay 
cut-rate rents in Renaissance Apartments, while Cahill�s tenants paid 
illegally inflated rents, and most of the former residents of the demolished 
Memorial Homes projects still have a memory, but no homes, in New Brunswick.

It may disturb Cahill�s busy schedule to explain how many of his proclaimed 
�new jobs� are the temporary, minimum wage grinds of undocumented 
immigrants, with no voting rights, security, benefits, or health care.

Why is there no school band to support the undefeated Zebra football team?  
How can $100+ million be found to build a corporate tower at Monument 
Square, while premiere Crossroads� Theater is vacated from its lease across 
the street? How come the fabulous city superstar, Jaheim, will have a #1 
album, �Still Ghetto�, release on election day, but he is not promoted by 
the city? Why is there no Women�s Center in the city? Why is there no public 
pool?

The Douglass College Government Association will sponsor a debate at 8:00 
pm, Wednesday, October 30, in the Douglass Student Center.  James Neal will 
be there to openly address the concerns of the community.  Will James Cahill 
be watching the clock?

thanks for the response. I will contact your Mr. Neal and see where hes at.
Xavier called me and spoke to me for about a half hour about your man and 
the
election. I told him that i didnt want to be in the middle of you guys 
fight,
especially if I had no idea what the issues were or what the fight was 
about.


while I am grateful for what you guys done in Newark, and appreciate you
putting in seriously invaluable work and time, I do not reject Xavier 
because
he didnt do the same....many did not show. Our movement is divided and oft
times secular. I do want to support Joe and I would like to be allowed to do
that . To come down and participate  as I see fit. Let me get a feel for
whats happening in NB. I would love to come to your rally or motorcade. Let
me do that and send me info on the campaign,

Ras

Subject:Re: Israel goes on collective punishment rampage<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>NetCloak 3.2.3f
2:40 PM, 11/5/02

You may think you know what happened on Jan. 3, when Israeli Navy Seals seized the Karine A, a cargo ship carrying 50 tons of contraband Katyusha rockets, anti-tank missiles, mortars, mines, explosives, and sniper rifles.

You may think the ship's captain acknowledged on TV that he is a Palestinian Authority (PA) employee acting under military orders, that he was dispatched to the Iranian shoreline to load the arms onto his ship. You may think he was heading to the waters off Gaza to release the arms in watertight cases for a pick-up by small Palestinian boats.

If you thought this, you would be in good company. "Unequivocal" was how Israel's chief of staff called the evidence of this being a PA smuggling operation. Condoleezza Rice, the U.S. national security advisor, said her government "seriously suspects" PA Chairman Yasser Arafat himself knew about the shipment. And Arafat, while denying personal culpability, acknowledged that his officers were implicated in the scheme.

But the Middle East media knows better. "The story of the arms ship is but a licensed fabrication by Israel," announces the editor-in-chief of the Egyptian government's daily, Al-Akhbar.

Saudi media agree that the episode was a hoax, with Arab News calling it "an elaborate trap" and Ar-Riyadh alleging that it "was necessary to fabricate the ship story" to implicate other Arab and Muslim countries as sponsors of terrorism. Qatar's Ash-Sharq interpreted it as an Israeli "pretext for more oppression and terrorism against the Palestinians" and a story that "no sane person can believe."

In other words, Middle Eastern media engaged in a bald, flat-out, and blatant denial of reality.

This fits into a well-established and important pattern. The home-video showing Osama bin Laden smirking as he described the devastation at the World Trade Center struck many Muslims as a fake. "I think this recording is forged . . . I don't believe this tape is authentic," announced Muhammad Salih, a Saudi religious figure.

The head of Jordan's Islamic Action Front, 'Abd al-Latif 'Arabiyat agreed: "Do the Americans really thing the world is that stupid to think that it would believe that this tape is evidence?"

Hani Siba'i of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad accused the Pentagon of using technology to simulate bin Laden's laugh. "It's a fake," he told Al-Jazeera. "The Americans fabricated it."

Muhammad Rizieq of the radical Indonesian Defenders Front called the tape "U.S. propaganda to cover up their war crimes in Afghanistan."

Of course, the Muslim world also refused responsibility for the attacks on Sept. 11: Gen. Hameed Gul, former head of Pakistani intelligence, deemed Israeli and U.S. agents "the obvious culprits. . . . This was clearly an inside job."

The father of Mohamed Atta, the alleged ringleader of the 9/11 attacks, completely refused to acknowledge his son's complicity, calling the evidence "a farce . . . a forgery, a fabrication."

Such willful denial is not new. Just last year, Iraqi Defense Minister Lt.-Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmed declared that because the U.S. government did not accomplish its goals in the 1991 Kuwait war, it had "lost the war," a sentiment shared by many in the region.

Likewise, the Egyptian government claimed victory over Israel in the October War of 1973 - and even built a museum dedicated to this fantasy. One Egyptian diplomat acknowledges, "I never knew we lost the war until I was 26." As his experience suggests, these lies are so often repeated that they become widely believed.

This pattern of avoiding unpleasant facts offers an insight into the problems of Muslim society. Turning defeat into victory, evidence into forgery, and terrorism into an "inside job" creates an alternate and more hospitable world.

But this denial avoids problems rather than dealing with them. Not acknowledging who carried out the 9/11 atrocities, for example, means ignoring its many causes, from a radicalized school curriculum to the use of Islamic "charities" for money-laundering.

Part of the U.S. war on terrorism, therefore, has to be working with Muslim governments and pressing them to face reality. This will not be easy, but so long as they remain in denial, the stage is set for fresh disasters.

Friends,

On Monday November 4. 2002, the Daily Targum, Rutgers University Campus
paper, published a racist advertisement attacking Palestinians ( In order to

will launch an ad campaign in the targum in order to:

1. Condemn the Targum for allowing racist ads to run
2. To educate students on the topic by providing informative, factual ads
such as UN resolutions, Amnesty international PR's, etc.

New Jersey Solidarity needs your help. In order to purchase space in the
Targum we will need donations from the community. Please help us fight
racism on campus,  in our community, our country and in the world . You can

Additional information:

ANTI-ARAB RACISM: The Last Acceptable Bigotry?
This advertisement appeared in the Daily Targum, the daily newspaper of
Rutgers University, on Monday, November 4, 2002. Posing as counterpoints the
alleged "heroes" of Israeli and Palestinian children, the advertisement
demonizes and dehumanizes the Palestinian people. In its association of
militancy and militarism solely with Palestinians (ignoring the ubiquity of
the Israeli army, the fourth-most-powerful in the world), it dramatically
misrepresents the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Beyond those political distortions, however, lies the real danger of this
advertisement. It is not merely a bit of pro-Israeli sloganeering. Rather,
it is an overtly racist attack upon the Palestinian people, young and old,
portraying them as somehow internally prone to violence and hatred--and
clearly inferior to Israelis, who are portrayed as instinctually heroic,
happy and positive.

The advertisement does not merely put forth a political perspective. It
demonizes Palestinians and seemingly exposes an inherent inferiority and
propensity to violence on the part of Palestinians. Even the youngest,
most innocent Palestinian--the school child--is demonized as nothing
morethan a future gunman. In the view of this advertisement, only some lives
are precious--and none of those are Palestinian. Rather than recognizing
common humanity, criticizing a political system, action or law, this
advertisement classifies all Palestinians as dangerous terrorists, whose
lives are not worth protecting--after all, every Palestinian will
inevitably grow into a life of violence. In its depiction of what is
clearly a "superior" race or ethnic group, and an "inferior" group, this
advertisement is blatant racism. Unlike student articles and commentaries,
which may raise issues of freedom of speech, this racist advertisement is
a paid promotion for anti-Arab racism. While we pay Targum fees on our
term bill every semester, the Targum should not be seeking profit in the
promotion of racism, bigotry and hatred.

The Daily Targum should NOT profit from racism! DEMAND AN APOLOGY!

New Brunswick Peoples� Campaign 2002
unite the many, defeat the few!

Strike Together--First Beat Cahill/J&amp;J�s shill!

The local split between progressive forces will guarantee one thing: victory 
to the backwards rule of J-Cahill, his cohorts, and especially the 
imperialist dictators he represents.   But a truce can, if we do the work, 
bring us to the doorstep of peoples� victory.

The Peoples� Campaign offers to immediately withdraw the candidacy of Joe 
Smith for city council, if it will help advance a united peoples� campaign.  
  This leaves us with 5 candidates for 3 positions, the deadline for ballot 
adjustments being September 12.  If we truly represent the people, we need 
to make moves now.

Informal discussions between members of the campaigns resulted in the 
proposal of a late-August joint, public event centered around mutual 
endorsement of each other�s ballot issues: functioning rent control and an 
elected board of education.  The intent being to bring the two groups to the 
same table in working unity, to strengthen the issues, and to create motion 
toward one democratic campaign, not two.

*Cahill can be expected to draw 5000+ votes in a tight race.
*Factoring the cheat, we must pull 10,000 votes to ensure a win.
*Ras Baraka lost Newark City Council by 114 votes of 9,000.
*Bush2 won(?) tie-breaking Florida by several hundred.
*We cannot afford a close race--it must be all-out!

Lenin said �March separately, strike together!�  Let us also.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
The _Daily Targum_ has, thus far, refused to apologize for printing the
racist advertisement on page 11 of the Monday, November 4 issue. When
confronted, the editorial staff and the business staff have referred
concerned students and community members to each other. We demand
accountability!

Advertisements may clearly be distinguished from student commentaries--and
while the Targum edits and rejects student commentaries, it applies a
principle of free speech seemingly only when that speech is *paid* speech.
Our communities deserve not only an apology for the racist advertisement,
but equal space--free--to raise our concerns about racism in the Targum,
at the university, and in our society. The rights of speech should not
belong to those who have the money to pay for it. For more information on
the racist advertisement, please see the Action Alert at
http://www.njsolidarity.org

As the Targum has been unresponsive, we must contact University
administration. Please contact Dr. Dennis' office and tell them that you
are concerned and upset about _Targum_ racism! Dr. Dennis has been
receptive to student concerns in the past. Please let him know how you
feel about racism!

Open Letter from Assata Shakur

    My name is Assata Shakur, and I am a 20th century escaped slave. Because 
of government persecution, I was left with no other choice than to flee from 
the political repression, racism and violence that dominate the US 
government's policy towards people of color. I am an ex-political prisoner, 
and I have been living in exile in Cuba since 1984.

    I have been a political activist most of my life, and although the U.S. 
government has done everything in its power to criminalize me, I am not a 
criminal, nor have I ever been one. In the 1960s, I participated in various 
struggles: the black liberation movement, the student rights movement, and 
the movement to end the war in Vietnam. I joined the Black Panther Party. By 
1969 the Black Panther Party had become the number one organization targeted 
by the FBI's COINTELPRO program. Because the Black Panther Party demanded 
the total liberation of black people, J. Edgar Hoover called it "greatest 
threat to the internal security of the country" and vowed to destroy it and 
its leaders and activists.

    In 1978, my case was one of many cases bought before the United Nations 
Organization in a petition filed by the National Conference of Black 
Lawyers, the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, and 
the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, exposing the 
existence of political prisoners in the United States, their political 
persecution, and the cruel and inhuman treatment they receive in US prisons. 
According to the report:

    The FBI and the New York Police Department in particular, charged and 
accused Assata Shakur of participating in attacks on law enforcement 
personnel and widely circulated such charges and accusations among police 
agencies and units. The FBI and the NYPD further charged her as being a 
leader of the Black Liberation Army which the government and its respective 
agencies described as an organization engaged in the shooting of police 
officers. This description of the Black Liberation Army and the accusation 
of Assata Shakur's relationship to it was widely circulated by government 
agents among police agencies and units. As a result of these activities by 
the government, Ms. Shakur became a hunted person; posters in police 
precincts and banks described her as being involved in serious criminal 
activities; she was highlighted on the FBI's most wanted list; and to police 
at all levels she became a 'shoot- to-kill' target."

    I was falsely accused in six different "criminal cases" and in all six 
of these cases I was eventually acquitted or the charges were dismissed. The 
fact that I was acquitted or that the charges were dismissed, did not mean 
that I received justice in the courts, that was certainly not the case. It 
only meant that the "evidence" presented against me was so flimsy and false 
that my innocence became evident. This political persecution was part and 
parcel of the government's policy of eliminating political opponents by 
charging them with crimes and arresting them with no regard to the factual 
basis of such charges.

    On May 2, 1973 I, along with Zayd Malik Shakur and Sundiata Acoli were 
stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike, supposedly for a "faulty tail light." 
Sundiata Acoli got out of the car to determine why we were stopped. Zayd and 
I remained in the car. State trooper Harper then came to the car, opened the 
door and began to question us. Because we were black, and riding in a car 
with Vermont license plates, he claimed he became "suspicious." He then drew 
his gun, pointed it at us, and told us to put our hands up in the air, in 
front of us, where he could see them. I complied and in a split second, 
there was a sound that came from outside the car, there was a sudden 
movement, and I was shot once with my arms held up in the air, and then once 
again from the back. Zayd Malik Shakur was later killed, trooper Werner 
Foerster was killed, and even though trooper Harper admitted that he shot 
and killed Zayd Malik Shakur, under the New Jersey felony murder law, I was 
charged with killing both Zayd Malik Shakur, who was my closest friend and 
comrade, and charged in the death of trooper Forester. Never in my life have 
I felt such grief. Zayd had vowed to protect me, and to help me to get to a 
safe place, and it was clear that he had lost his life, trying to protect 
both me and Sundiata. Although he was also unarmed, and the gun that killed 
trooper Foerster was found under Zayd's leg, Sundiata Acoli, who was 
captured later, was also charged with both deaths. Neither Sundiata Acoli 
nor I ever received a fair trial We were both convicted in the news media 
way before our trials. No news media was ever permitted to interview us, 
although the New Jersey police and the FBI fed stories to the press on a 
daily basis. In 1977, I was convicted by an all- white jury and sentenced to 
life plus 33 years in prison. In 1979, fearing that I would be murdered in 
prison, and knowing that I would never receive any justice, I was liberated 
from prison, aided by committed comrades who understood the depths of the 
injustices in my case, and who were also extremely fearful for my life.

    The U.S. Senate's 1976 Church Commission report on intelligence 
operations inside the USA, revealed that "The FBI has attempted covertly to 
influence the public's perception of persons and organizations by 
disseminating derogatory information to the press, either anonymously or 
through "friendly" news contacts." This same policy is evidently still very 
much in effect today.

    On December 24, 1997, The New Jersey State called a press conference to 
announce that New Jersey State Police had written a letter to Pope John Paul 
II asking him to intervene on their behalf and to aid in having me 
extradited back to New Jersey prisons. The New Jersey State Police refused 
to make their letter public. Knowing that they had probably totally distort 
the facts, and attempted to get the Pope to do the devils work in the name 
of religion, I decided to write the Pope to inform him about the reality of' 
"justice" for black people in the State of New Jersey and in the United 
States. (See attached Letter to the Pope).

    In January of 1998, during the pope's visit to Cuba, I agreed to do an 
interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza around my letter to the Pope, 
about my experiences in New Jersey court system, and about the changes I saw 
in the United States and it's treatment of Black people in the last 25 
years. I agreed to do this interview because I saw this secret letter to the 
Pope as a vicious, vulgar, publicity maneuver on the part of the New Jersey 
State Police, and as a cynical attempt to manipulate Pope John Paul II. I 
have lived in Cuba for many years, and was completely out of touch with the 
sensationalist, dishonest, nature of the establishment media today. It is 
worse today than it was 30 years ago. After years of being victimized by the 
"establishment" media it was naive of me to hope that I might finally get 
the opportunity to tell "my side of the story." Instead of an interview with 
me, what took place was a "staged media event" in three parts, full of
distortions, inaccuracies and outright lies. NBC purposely misrepresented 
the facts. Not only did NBC spend thousands of dollars promoting this 
"exclusive interview series" on NBC, they also spent a great deal of money 
advertising this "exclusive interview" on black radio stations and also 
placed notices in local newspapers.

    DISTORTIONS AND LIES IN THE NBC SERIES

        In an NBC interview Gov. Whitman was quoted as saying that "this has 
nothing to do with race, this had everything to do with crime." Either Gov. 
Whitman is completely unfamiliar with the facts in my case, or her 
sensitivity to racism and to the plight of black people and other people of 
color in the United States is at a sub-zero level. In 1973 the trial in 
Middlesex County had to be stopped because of the overwhelming racism 
expressed in the jury room. The court was finally forced to rule that the 
entire jury panel had been contaminated by racist comments like "If she's 
black, she's guilty." In an obvious effort to prevent us from being tried by 
"a jury of our peers the New Jersey courts ordered that a jury be selected 
from Morris County, New Jersey where only 2.2 percent of the population was 
black and 97.5 percent of potential jurors were white. In a study done in 
Morris County, one of the wealthiest counties in the country, 92 percent of 
the registered voters said that they were familiar with the case through the 
news media, and 72 percent believed we were guilty based on pretrial 
publicity. During the jury selection process in Morris County, white 
supremacists from the National Social White People's Party, wearing 
Swastikas, demonstrated carrying signs reading "SUPPORT WHITE POLICE." The 
trial was later moved back to Middlesex County where 70 percent thought I 
was guilty based on pretrial publicity I was tried by an all-white jury, 
where the presumption of innocence was not the criteria for jury selection. 
Potential jurors were merely asked if they could "put their prejudices 
aside, and "render a fair verdict." The basic reality in the United States 
is that being black is a crime and black people are always "suspects" and an 
accusation is usually a conviction. Most white people still think that being 
a "black militant" or a "black revolutionary" is tantamount to being guilty 
of some kind of crime. The current situation in New Jersey's prisons, 
underlines the racism that dominates the politics of the state of New 
Jersey, in particular and in the U.S. as a whole. Although the population of 
New Jersey is approximately 78 percent white, more than 75 percent of New 
Jersey's prison population is made up of blacks and Latinos. 80 percent of 
the women in Jersey prisons are people of color. That may not seem like 
racism to Gov. Whitman, but it reeks of of racism to us.

        The NBC story implied that Governor Christie Whitman raised the 
reward for my capture based on my interview with NBC. The fact of the matter 
is that she has been campaigning since she was elected into office to double 
the reward for my capture. In 1994, she appointed Col. Carl Williams who 
immediately vowed to make my capture a priority. In 1995, Gov. Whitman 
sought to "match a $25,000 departmental appropriation sponsored by an 
"unidentified legislator." I watched a tape of Gov. Whitman's "testimony" in 
her interview with NBC. She gave a very dramatic, exaggerated version of 
what happened, but there is no evidence whatsoever to support her claim that 
Trooper Foerster had "four bullets in him at least, and then they got up and 
with his own gun, fired two bullets into his head." She claimed that she was 
writing Janet Reno for federal assistance in my capture, based on what she 
saw in the NBC interview. If this is the kind of "information" that is being 
passed on to Janet Reno and the Pope, it is clear that the facts have been 
totally distorted. Whitman also claimed that my return to prison should be a 
condition for "normalizing relations with Cuba". How did I get so important 
that my life can determine the foreign relations between two governments? 
Anybody who knows anything about New Jersey politics can be certain that her 
motives are purely political. She, like Torrecelli and several other 
opportunistic politicians in New Jersey came to power, as part- time 
lobbyists for the Batistia faction - soliciting votes from right wing 
Cubans. They want to use my case as a barrier for normalizing relations with 
Cuba, and as a pretext for maintaining the immoral blockade against the 
Cuban people.

        In what can only be called deliberate deception and slander NBC 
aired a photograph of a woman with a gun in her hand implying that the woman 
in the photograph was me. I was not, in fact, the woman in the photograph. 
The photograph was taken from a highly publicized case where I was accused 
of bank robbery. Not only did I voluntarily insist on participating in a 
lineup, during which witnesses selected another woman, but during the trial, 
several witnesses, including the manager of the bank, testified that the 
woman in that photograph was not me. I was acquitted of that bank robbery. 
NBC aired that photograph on at least 5 different occasions, representing 
the woman in the photograph as me. How is it possible, that the New Jersey 
State Police, who claim to have a detective working full time on my case, 
Governor of New Jersey Christine Whitman, who claimed she reviewed all the 
"evidence," or NBC, which has an extensive research department, did not know 
that the photograph was false? It was a vile, fraudulent attempt to make me 
look guilty. NBC deliberately misrepresented the truth. Even after many 
people had called in, and there was massive fax, and e-mail campaign 
protesting NBC's mutilation of the facts, Ralph Penza and NBC continued to 
broadcast that photograph, representing it as me. Not once have the New 
Jersey State Police, Governor Christine Whitman, or NBC come forth and 
stated that I was not the woman in the photograph, or that I had been 
acquitted of that charge.

        Another major lie and distortion was that we had left trooper Werner 
Foerster on the roadside to die. The truth is that there was a major 
cover-up as to what happened on May 2, 1973. Trooper Harper, the same man 
who shot me with my arms raised in the air, testified that he returned to 
the State Police Headquarters which was less than 200 yards away, "To seek 
aid." However, tape recordings and police reports made on May 2, 1973 prove 
that not only did Trooper Harper give several conflicting statements about 
what happened on the turnpike, but he never once mentioned the name of 
Werner Foerster, or the fact that the incident took place right in front of 
the Trooper Headquarters. In an effort to hide his tracks and cover his 
guilt he said nothing whatsoever about Foerster to his superiors or to his 
fellow officers.

        In a clear attempt to discredit me, Col. Carl Williams of the New 
Jersey State Police was allowed to give blow by blow distortions of my 
interview. In my interview I stated that on the night of May 2, 1973 I was 
shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back. Williams stated 
"that is absolutely false. Our records show that she reached in her 
pocketbook, pulled out a nine millimeter weapon and started firing." 
However, the claim that I reached into my pocketbook and pulled out a gun, 
while inside the car was even contested by trooper Harper. Although on three 
official reports, and when he testified before the grand jury he stated that 
he saw me take a gun out of my pocketbook, he finally admitted under 
cross-examination that he never saw me with my hands in a pocketbook, never 
saw me with a weapon inside the car, and that he did not see me shoot him.

        The truth is that I was examined by 3 medical specialists:
            (1) A Neurologist who testified that I was immediately paralyzed 
immediately after the being shot.
            (2) A Surgeon who testified that "It was absolutely anatomically 
necessary that both arms be in the air for Mrs. Chesimard to receive the 
wounds." The same surgeon also testified that the claim by Trooper Harper 
that I had been crouching in a firing position when I was shot was "totally 
anatomically
impossible."
            (3) A Pathologist who testified that "There is no conceivable 
way that it [the bullet] could have traveled over to hit the clavicle if her 
arm was down." he said "It was impossible to have that trajectory"
        The prosecutors presented no medical testimony whatsoever to refute 
the above medical evidence.

        No evidence whatsoever was ever presented that I had a 9-millimeter 
weapon, in fact New Jersey State Police testified that the 9-millimeter 
weapon belonged to Zayd Malik Shakur based on a holster fitting the weapon 
that they was recovered from his body.

        There were no fingerprints, or any other evidence whatsoever that 
linked me to any guns or ammunition.

        The results of the Neutron Activation test to determine whether or 
not I had fired a weapon were negative.

        Although Col. Williams refers to us as the "criminal element" 
neither Zayd, or Sundiata Acoli or I were criminals, we were political 
activists. I was a college student until the police kicked down my door in 
an effort to force me to "cooperate" with them and Sundiata Acoli was a 
computer expert who had worked for NASA, before he joined the Black Panther 
Party and was targeted by COINTELPRO.

        In an obvious maneuver to provoke sympathy for the police, the NBC 
series juxtaposed my interview with the weeping widow of Werner Foerster. 
While I can sympathize with her grief, I believe that her appearance was 
deliberately included to appeal to people's emotions, to blur the facts, to 
make me look like a villain, and to create the kind of lynch mob mentality 
that has historically been associated with white women portrayed as victims 
of black people. In essence the supposed interview with me became a forum 
for the New State Police, Foerster's widow, and the obviously hostile 
commentary of Ralph Penza. The two initial programs together lasted 3.5 
minutes - me - 59 seconds, the widow 50 seconds, the state police 38 
seconds, and Penza - 68 seconds. Not once in the interview was I ever asked 
about Zayd, Sundiata or their families. As the interview went on, it was 
painfully evident that Ralph Penza would never see me as a human being. 
Although I tried to talk about racism and about the victims of government 
and police repression, it was clear that he was totally uninterested.

        I have stated publicly on various occasions that I was ashamed of 
participating in my trial in New Jersey trial because it was so racist, but 
I did testify. Even though I was extremely limited by the judge, as to what 
I could testfy about, I testified as clearly as I could about what happened 
that night. After being almost fatally wounded I managed to climb in the 
back seat of the car to get away from the shooting. Sundiata drove the car 
five miles down the road carried me into a grassy area because he was afraid 
that the police would see the car parked on the side of the road and just 
start shooting into it again. Yes, it was five miles down the highway where 
I wascaptured, dragged out of the car, stomped and then left on the ground. 
Although I drifted in and out of consciousness I remember clearly that both 
while I was lying on the ground, and while I was in the ambulance, I kept 
hearing the State troopers ask "is she dead yet?" Because of my condition I 
have no independent recollection of how long I was on the ground, or how 
long it was before the ambulance was allowed to leave for the hospital, but 
in the trial transcript trooper Harper stated that it was while he was being 
questioned, some time after 2:00 am that a detective told him that I had 
just been brought into the hospital. I was the only live "suspect" in 
custody, and prior to that time Harper, had never told anyone that a woman 
had shot him.

        As I watched Governor Whitman's interview the one thing that struck 
me was her "outrage" at my joy about being a grandmother, and my "quite nice 
life" as she put it here in Cuba. While I love the Cuban people and the 
solidarity they have shown me, the pain of being torn away from everybody I 
love has been intense. I have never had the opportunity to see or to hold my 
grandchild. If Gov. Whitman thinks that my life has been so nice, that 50 
years of dealing with racism, poverty, persecution, brutality, prison, 
underground, exile and blatant lies has been so nice, then I'd be more than 
happy to let her walk in my shoes for a while so she can get a taste of how 
it feels. I am a proud black woman, and I'm not about to get on the 
television and cry for Ralph Penza or any other journalist, but the way I 
have suffered in my lifetime, and the way my people have suffered, only god 
can bear witness to.

    Col. Williams of the New Jersey State Police stated "we would do 
everything we could go get her off the island of Cuba and if that includes 
kidnaping, we would do it." I guess the theory is that if they could kidnap 
millions of Africans from Africa 400 years ago, they should be able to 
kidnap one African woman today. It is nothing but an attempt to bring about 
the re-incarnation of the Fugitive Slave Act. All I represent is just 
another slave that they want to bring back to the plantation. Well, I might 
be a slave, but I will go to my grave a rebellious slave. I am and I feel 
like a maroon woman. I will never voluntarily accept the condition of 
slavery, whether it's de-facto or ipso- facto, official, or unofficial. In 
another recent interview, Williams talked about asking the federal 
government to add to the $50,000 reward for my capture. He also talked about 
seeking "outside money, or something like that, a benefactor, whatever." Now 
who is he looking to "contribute" to that "cause"? The Ku Klux Klan, the Neo 
Nazi Parties, the white militia organizations? But the plot gets even 
thicker. He says that the money might lure bounty hunters. "There are 
individuals out there, I guess they call themselves 'soldiers of fortune' 
who might be interested in doing something, in turning her over to us" Well, 
in the old days they used to call them slave- catchers, trackers, or 
patter-rollers, now they are called mercenaries. Neither the governor nor 
the state police say one word about "justice." They have no moral authority 
to do so. The level of their moral and ethical bankruptcy is evident in 
their eagerness to not only break the law and hire hoodlums, all in the name 
of "law and order." But you know what gets to me, what makes me truly 
indignant? With the schools in Paterson, N.J. falling down, with areas of 
Newark looking like a disaster area, with the crack epidemic, with the 
wide-spread poverty and unemployment in New Jersey, these depraved, 
decadent, would-be slave-masters want federal funds to help put this "nigger 
wench" back in her place. They call me the "most wanted woman" in Amerika. I 
find that ironic. I've never felt very "wanted" before. When it came to 
jobs, I was never the "most wanted," when it came to "economic opportunities 
I was never the "most wanted, when it came to decent housing." It seems like 
the only time Black people are on the "most wanted" list is when they want 
to put us in prison.

    But at this moment, I am not so concerned about myself. Everybody has to 
die sometime, and all I want is to go with dignity. I am more concerned 
about the growing poverty, the growing despair that is rife in Amerika. I am 
more concerned about our younger generations, who represent our future. I am 
more concerned that one-third of young black are either in prison or under 
the jurisdiction of the "criminal in-justice system." I am more concerned 
about the rise of the prison-industrial complex that is turning our people 
into slaves again. I am more concerned about the repression, the police 
brutality, violence, the rising wave of racism that makes up the political 
landscape of the U.S. today. Our young people deserve a future, and I 
consider it the mandate of my ancestors to be part of the struggle to insure 
that they have one. They have the right to live free from political 
repression. The U.S. is becoming more and more of a police state and that 
fact compels us to fight against political repression. I urge you all, every 
single person who reads this statement, to fight to free all political 
prisoners. As the concentration camps in the U.S. turn into death camps, I 
urge you to fight to abolish the death penalty. I make a special, urgent 
appeal to you to fight to save the life of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the only 
political prisoner who is currently on death row.

    It has been a long time since I have lived inside the United States. But 
during my lifetime I have seen every prominent black leader, politician or 
activist come under attack by the establishment media. When African 
-Americans appear on news programs they are usually talking  about sports, 
entertainment or they are in handcuffs. When we have a protest they ridicule 
it, minimized it, or cut the numbers of the people who attended in half. The 
news is big business and it is owned operated by affluent white men. 
Unfortunately, they shape the way that many people see the world, and even 
the way people see themselves. Too often black journalists, and other 
journalists of color mimic their white counterparts. They often gear their 
reports to reflect the foreign policies and the domestic policies of the 
same people who are oppressing their people. In the establishment media, the 
bombing and of murder of thousands of innocent women and children in Libya 
or Iraq or Panama is seen as "patriotic," while those who fight for freedom, 
no matter where they are, are seen as "radicals," "extremists," or 
"terrorists."

    Like most poor and oppressed people in the United States, I do not have 
a voice. Black people, poor people in the U.S. have no real freedom of 
speech, no real freedom of expression and very little freedom of the press. 
The black press and the progressive media has historically played an 
essential role in the struggle for social justice. We need to continue and 
to expand that tradition. We need to create media outlets that help to 
educate our people and our children, and not annihilate their minds. I am 
only one woman. I own no TV stations, or Radio Stations or Newspapers. But I 
feel that people need to be educated as to what is going on, and to 
understand the connection between the news media and the instruments of 
repression in Amerika. All I have is my voice, my spirit and the will to 
tell the truth. But I sincerely ask, those of you in the Black media, those 
of you in the progressive media, those of you who believe in truth freedom, 
To publish this statement and to let people know what is happening. We have 
no voice, so you must be the voice of the voiceless.

Free all Political Prisoners,
I send you Love and Revolutionary Greetings
From Cuba, One of the Largest, Most Resistant and
Most Courageous Palenques (Maroon Camps)
That has ever existed on the Face of this Planet.


Assata Shakur
Havana, Cuba

unite the many, defeat the few!

Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques

10 November, 2003

Just in from the Peace and Justice Camp

1.  Throughout the day today, three war ships were seen in Vieques coastal 
waters.  From the Peace and Justice Camp, members of the Committee for the 
Rescue and Development of Vieques (CRDV) could see the US Navy ships in 
waters south of the island.  Information available from our advisors on 
military maneuvers, indicate that the "jtfex" exercises (Joint Forces 
Exercises) of the battle group of the USS Harry S. Trumanthe aircraft 
carrier, took place in North Carolina from 28 October to November 6th.  The 
same calendar includes as the next maneuvers in our area, the COMPUTEX 
exercises of the USS Theodroe Roosevelt and its battle group, from January 
22 until February 20th.  Spokespersons for the CRDV denounced the presence 
of the ships in Vieques waters as a violation of the peace of the people of 
Vieques and the region.  They signalled that the appearance of the war ships 
without previous notification to fishermen or local government officials is 
indicative of the arrogance and secretivity with which the Navy has acted 
here for decades.  Nilda Medina, spokeswoman for the Committee and 
coordinator of the Peace and Justice Camp, expressed concern that the 
military could maintain this posture beyond May of 2003, and she urged all 
those in solidarity with the struggle for peace on Vieques to denounce the 
continued use of Vieques and its waters by the Navy to prepare for war 
against Irak or any other military aggression.

2.  On Monday, November 11th, we conmemorate the anniversary of the death of 
Angel Rodr�guez Crist�bal, arrested on May 19th, 1979, as part of "the 21", 
a group of civil disobedients participating in an ecumenical activity in 
restricted lands inside Camp Garc�a here.  Angel was sentenced to six months 
in federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida.  On 11 November, 1979, he was 
murdered in his jail cell by federal officers.  On this date each year we 
remember Angel and reafirm our committment to the struggle in Vieques.  The 
activities will take place at 11AM in front of the bust of Angel at the 
beach in Esperanza.

3.  Work continues on the reconstruction at the Peace and Justice Camp.  We 
make great efforts to move the office of the CRDV from the house it has 
occupied for the past three years, to a building next door,  also within the 
PJC. by the end of this month.   The work implies a significant investment 
of human and economic resources.  The work on preparing the small structure 
that will house the office beginning 1 December, includes plastering inside 
and out, installation of water, electricity and phone lines, secure windows 
and doors, among other chores.  We ask for your economic help to assure the 
continuation of the CRDV�s work at this important space in the struggle for 
peace on Vieques.

exercises of the USS Theodroe Roosevelt and its battle group, from January 
22 until February 20th.  Spokespersons for the CRDV denounced the presence 
of the ships in Vieques waters as a violation of the peace of the people of 
Vieques and the region.  They signalled that the appearance of the war ships 
without previous notification to fishermen or local government officials is 
indicative of the arrogance and secretivity with which the Navy has acted 
here for decades.  Nilda Medina, spokeswoman for the Committee and 
coordinator of the Peace and Justice Camp, expressed concern that the 
military could maintain this posture beyond May of 2003, and she urged all 
those in solidarity with the struggle for peace on Vieques to denounce the 
continued use of Vieques and its waters by the Navy to prepare for war 
against Irak or any other military aggression.

2.  On Monday, November 11th, we conmemorate the anniversary of the death of 
Angel Rodr�guez Crist�bal, arrested on May 19th, 1979, as part of "the 21", 
a group of civil disobedients participating in an ecumenical activity in 
restricted lands inside Camp Garc�a here.  Angel was sentenced to six months 
in federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida.  On 11 November, 1979, he was 
murdered in his jail cell by federal officers.  On this date each year we 
remember Angel and reafirm our committment to the struggle in Vieques.  The 
activities will take place at 11AM in front of the bust of Angel at the 
beach in Esperanza.

3.  Work continues on the reconstruction at the Peace and Justice Camp.  We 
make great efforts to move the office of the CRDV from the house it has 
occupied for the past three years, to a building next door,  also within the 
PJC. by the end of this month.   The work implies a significant investment 
of human and economic resources.  The work on preparing the small structure 
that will house the office beginning 1 December, includes plastering inside 
and out, installation of water, electricity and phone lines, secure windows 
and doors, among other chores.  We ask for your economic help to assure the 
continuation of the CRDV�s work at this important space in the struggle for 
peace on Vieques.

RALLY AGAINST TARGUM RACISM * TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 12 * 1:00 PM * BROWER
COMMONS * COLLEGE AVENUE CAMPUS * RUTGERS UNIVERSITY * NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ

The DAILY TARGUM, the daily campus newspaper of Rutgers University, on
Monday, November 4, 2002, ran a racist advertisement demonizing all
Palestinian children as future suicide bombers, declaring that while an
athlete is "Israeli school children's hero," a suicide bomber is
"Palestinian school children's hero." Despite previous precedent of--at the
very least--publishing an editors' note indicating the offensive nature of
the advertisement, the Targum printed the half-page advertisement without
comment. For more information on the racist advertisement, please see the
Action Alert at http://www.njsolidarity.org/.

Since that time, the Targum has received numerous phone calls, letters, and
meetings with student and community representatives demanding an apology for
running the racist advertisement, free space to affected communities at the
University to respond (as was provided in past incidents of Targum-published
racist material) and fair and balanced coverage. Despite the volume of
complaints received, the Targum has refused to make a public statement about
the issue or apologize for its lack of recognition of anti-Arab racism.

OUR VOICES MUST BE HEARD!

We call upon ALL communities affected by media racism to come together in
common struggle! Unite against media bias and racism--speak out! Only
through our unity and action will change be won. Come out and rally on
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 12 at 1:00 PM at BROWER COMMONS at RUTGERS UNIVERSITY in
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ!

Wednesday, November 13, 2002 is the National Day of Action to Divest from
Israeli Apartheid. Across the country, campus and community activists are
organizing events and activities to demand that their universities divest
from investment in Israel, corporations stop doing business with Israel, and
our government cease tax-funded aid to Israel. So long as our dollars go
toward perpetuating the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and
the oppression of the Palestinian people, we are forced to be complicit in
that oppression. We say: Not in our name! Please see the Day of Action
website at http://november13.pathbot.com/ for information on actions across
the country.

Here in New Brunswick, New Jersey, New Jersey Solidarity activists and
Rutgers University students will protest STARBUCKS COFFEE at 391 George
Street in downtown New Brunswick, NJ from 12 noon-1 pm on Wednesday,
November 13! Throughout the US and around the world, Starbucks has been
targeted for boycott by those seeking justice in Palestine. In addition to
Starbucks' overall shoddy corporate record, Starbucks chairman Harold
Schultz is an active Zionist and champion of Israel. He has worked actively
as a propagandist for the Israeli foreign ministry (which has praised him
for his efforts in presenting the Israeli view on various campuses), and has
been awarded "The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award" by the Jerusalem
Fund of Aish HaTorah. In addition, Starbucks has numerous stores operating
in Israel and is looking toward expanding its Israeli presence.

BOYCOTT ISRAEL-BOYCOTT STARBUCKS! RALLY 12 NOON - 1 PM NOVEMBER 13 at
STARBUCKS!

Iraq Advised to Reject U.N. Plan

By SAMEER N. YACOUB
Associated Press Writer

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A key lawmaker told an emergency session of Parliament 
Monday that the Iraqi leadership should reject a tough, new U.N. resolution 
governing weapons inspections.

"The committee advises ... the rejection of Security Council Resolution 1441 
and to not agree to it," Salim al-Koubaisi, head of the foreign relations 
committee, told lawmakers in the rubber-stamp Parliament.

President Saddam Hussein, who is under a new U.N. demand for him to 
eliminate weapons of mass destruction, called the emergency session Sunday.

The open session of parliament was being shown live on Iraqi satellite 
television, a day after Arab ministers urged Baghdad to cooperate with 
weapons inspectors to avoid war.

"The ill intentions in this resolution are flagrant and loud in ignoring all 
the work that has been achieved in past years," said Parliament speaker 
Saadoun Hamadi, as he opened the special session.

Parliament's response to the new U.N. resolution, which demands Iraq 
cooperate with U.N. inspectors hunting for weapons of mass destruction, will 
be a recommendation to the Revolutionary Command Council, Iraq's major 
executive body headed by Saddam.

Should parliament recommend acceptance, Saddam would have some cover for 
retreating from previous objections to any new resolution governing weapons 
inspections.

Iraq has until Friday to accept or reject the resolution, approved 
unanimously by the 15-member U.N. Security Council last week. It threatens 
Iraq with "serious consequences" unless it cooperates.

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice dismissed the legislative 
gathering as "ludicrous."

"Saddam Hussein is an absolute dictator and tyrant, and the idea that 
somehow he expects the Iraqi parliament to debate this - they've never 
debated anything else," Rice said on ABC's "This Week." "I'm surprised he's 
even bothering to go through this ploy."

Senior Bush administration officials said the president has approved 
tentative Pentagon plans for invading Iraq should a new U.N. arms inspection 
effort fail. The strategy calls for a land, sea and air force of 200,000 to 
250,000 troops, officials said.

"Should military action become necessary for our own security, I will commit 
the full force and might of the United States military and we will prevail," 
President Bush said Monday in a White House speech.

The resolution gives inspectors unrestricted access to any suspected weapons 
site and the right to interview Iraqi scientists outside the country and 
without Iraqi officials present - both issues that could become points of 
dispute.

Iraq has insisted on respect for its sovereignty, an argument it has used in 
the past to restrict access to Saddam's palaces.

On Sunday, the U.S. Central Command said in a statement on its Web site that 
U.S.-British aircraft enforcing a no-fly zone in southern Iraq fired 
precision-guided weapons at two surface-to-air missile sites near Talil, 175 
miles southeast of Baghdad, in response to Iraqi hostile acts. There was no 
word from Baghdad on the strike, and the U.S. military said damage 
assessment was ongoing.

In Baghdad, the state-run al-Jumhuriya daily urged Arab governments and 
people on Monday to "stand firm against U.S. aggressive schemes" against 
Iraq and the Arabs. In a front-page editorial, the newspaper called on Arab 
governments to use oil as a weapon against the United States and Britain.

Saddam has called on Arab oil exporters to boycott the West before, but Gulf 
oil producers say such a move would be impractical and not in their 
interest.

In Cairo, foreign ministers of Arab League nations ended a two-day meeting 
with a final communique that seeks to avoid U.S.-Iraq confrontation.

It urges Iraq and the United Nations to work together to implement the 
resolution and calls on the United States to commit to pledges it gave Syria 
that the resolution could not be used to justify military action.

"In our deliberations, the consensus was to deal with the Security Council 
resolution, accepting its direction, and this is left for the government of 
Iraq to decide," Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa told reporters 
late Sunday after the meeting ended.

The Arab ministers put forward a united position of "absolute rejection" of 
any military action against Iraq, saying it represents a threat to the 
security of all Arab nations - a view Iraqi officials have pressed in recent 
lobbying of fellow Arab leaders.

They also demanded Arab experts be included on U.N. weapons inspection 
teams, but did not specify numbers or nationalities, and called on the 
Security Council to require Israel to rid itself of weapons of mass 
destruction.

In Damascus, the opposition Iraqi Communist Party in exile urged the 
government to accept the resolution, calling it "the last chance for a 
diplomatic and peaceful solution."

Lawyers Criticize Sniper Case Leaks

By MATTHEW BARAKAT
Associated Press Writer

Gilbert reports Malvo's attorneys are slamming authorities over how they've 
handled the questioning of their client. (Audio)

McLEAN, Va. (AP) -- Lawyers for the sniper suspects criticized the police 
interrogation of 17-year-old John Lee Malvo and said they would seek to bar 
his alleged confession from court.

Malvo reportedly confessed to being the triggerman in several of the 
Washington-area sniper shootings, including the Virginia slaying in which 
his alleged accomplice, 41-year-old John Allen Muhammad, is charged with 
murder.

Malvo's lawyer, Michael Arif, criticized police for questioning Malvo 
without his court-appointed guardian or attorney and for leaking the alleged 
confession to The Washington Post.

"The police are flooding the media and poisoning the jury pool with their 
own paraphrasing and subjective interpretations of statements made during an 
unconstitutional interrogation," Arif said.

He said the leak "suggests an insecurity on the part of the commonwealth 
with the admissibility of these statements."

Malvo talked to investigators for seven hours after he and Muhammad were 
handed over to Virginia authorities Thursday for prosecution on 
death-penalty murder charges. Sources told the Post that Malvo was talkative 
and even bragged in some of his responses, but kept quiet about Muhammad.

For a murder conviction, prosecutors must show that the defendant was the 
triggerman. However, under the state's post-Sept. 11 anti-terrorism law, 
Muhammad could face the death penalty even if he is not found to be the 
gunman.

A Fairfax County police spokesman declined to comment on the interrogation, 
and Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Robert F. Horan Jr. did not 
return calls.

One of the shootings for which Malvo reportedly took responsibility is the 
Oct. 14 slaying of FBI analyst Linda Franklin. Fairfax County prosecutors 
charged Malvo with capital murder in that killing.

Muhammad is being prosecuted in Prince William County for the Oct. 9 slaying 
of Dean Harold Meyers. It is unclear how Malvo's alleged confession to that 
crime might affect Muhammad's case.

Muhammad's attorney, Peter Greenspun, declined to comment on the case 
directly, but said the interrogation of Malvo without his court-appointed 
representatives was wrong.

"I think everybody should be concerned about that, not just lawyers," he 
said.

Todd G. Petit, Malvo's appointed guardian, said he went to police 
headquarters Thursday and asked that questioning be halted. Petit said a 
police commander agreed to pass on his request, then ordered him to leave.

Arif said he will seek to suppress any incriminating statements.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel O. Osbourne, the New Jersey man who befriended the two 
suspects, said he felt sorry for them and helped Muhammad buy and register 
the blue 1990 Chevrolet Caprice that was later allegedly used in the 
attacks.

"He never talked to me about anything of a criminal nature," Osbourne told 
the Post in Monday's editions. "People may ask, 'Did they present themselves 
as vicious criminals?' And I never saw that."

Osbourne, who was freed last week by federal authorities after being 
detained as a material witness, said when they arrived in New Jersey in 
early September, apparently by bus, they were disheveled and nearly 
penniless, reeking in soiled clothes. Their goal, he said, was to get a car 
to continue their travels.

"They wanted a car from the beginning," Osbourne said.

"I had great compassion for them when I saw them," he recalled. "I looked at 
them, man, and said to myself, 'Life is no promise. There is no guarantee.'"

<pre>The president's real goal in Iraq
Jay Bookman
Bookman is the deputy editorial
page editor of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution

By JAY BOOKMAN

The official story on Iraq has never made sense. The connection that the 
Bush administration has tried to draw between Iraq and al-Qaida has always 
seemed contrived and artificial. In fact, it was hard to believe that smart 
people in the Bush administration would start a major war based on such 
flimsy evidence.

CONTRIBUTORS TO 2000 REPORT
"Rebuilding America's Defenses," a 2000 report by the Project for the New 
American Century, listed 27 people as having attended meetings or 
contributed papers in preparation of the report. Among them are six who have 
since assumed key defense and foreign policy positions in the Bush 
administration. And the report seems to have become a blueprint for Bush's 
foreign and defense policy.


Paul Wolfowitz
Political science doctorate from University of Chicago and dean of the 
international relations program at Johns Hopkins University during the 
1990s. Served in the Reagan State Department, moved to the Pentagon during 
the first Bush administration as undersecretary of defense for policy. Sworn 
in as deputy defense secretary in March 2001.

John Bolton
Yale Law grad who worked in the Reagan administration as an assistant 
attorney general. Switched to the State Department in the first Bush 
administration as assistant secretary for international organization 
affairs. Sworn in as undersecretary of state for arms control and 
international security, May 2001.

Eliot Cohen
Harvard doctorate in government who taught at Harvard and at the Naval War 
College. Now directs strategic studies at Johns Hopkins and is the author of 
several books on military strategy. Was on the Defense Department's policy 
planning staff in the first Bush administration and is now on Donald 
Rumsfeld's Defense Policy Board.

I. Lewis Libby
Law degree from Columbia (Yale undergrad). Held advisory positions in the 
Reagan State Department. Was a partner in a Washington law firm in the late 
'80s before becoming deputy undersecretary of defense for policy in the 
first Bush administration (under Dick Cheney). Now is the vice president's 
chief of staff.

Dov Zakheim
Doctorate in economics and politics from Oxford University. Worked on policy 
issues in the Reagan Defense Department and went into private defense 
consulting during the 1990s. Was foreign policy adviser to the 2000 Bush 
campaign. Sworn in as undersecretary of defense (comptroller) and chief 
financial officer for the Pentagon, May 2001.

Stephen Cambone
Political science doctorate from Claremont Graduate School. Was in charge of 
strategic defense policy at the Defense Department in the first Bush 
administration. Now heads the Office of Program, Analysis and Evaluation at 
the Defense Department.


The pieces just didn't fit. Something else had to be going on; something was 
missing.

In recent days, those missing pieces have finally begun to fall into place. 
As it turns out, this is not really about Iraq. It is not about weapons of 
mass destruction, or terrorism, or Saddam, or U.N. resolutions.

This war, should it come, is intended to mark the official emergence of the 
United States as a full-fledged global empire, seizing sole responsibility 
and authority as planetary policeman. It would be the culmination of a plan 
10 years or more in the making, carried out by those who believe the United 
States must seize the opportunity for global domination, even if it means 
becoming the "American imperialists" that our enemies always claimed we 
were.

Once that is understood, other mysteries solve themselves. For example, why 
does the administration seem unconcerned about an exit strategy from Iraq 
once Saddam is toppled?

Because we won't be leaving. Having conquered Iraq, the United States will 
create permanent military bases in that country from which to dominate the 
Middle East, including neighboring Iran.

In an interview Friday, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld brushed aside that 
suggestion, noting that the United States does not covet other nations' 
territory. That may be true, but 57 years after World War II ended, we still 
have major bases in Germany and Japan. We will do the same in Iraq.

And why has the administration dismissed the option of containing and 
deterring Iraq, as we had the Soviet Union for 45 years? Because even if it 
worked, containment and deterrence would not allow the expansion of American 
power. Besides, they are beneath us as an empire. Rome did not stoop to 
containment; it conquered. And so should we.

Among the architects of this would-be American Empire are a group of 
brilliant and powerful people who now hold key positions in the Bush 
administration: They envision the creation and enforcement of what they call 
a worldwide "Pax Americana," or American peace. But so far, the American 
people have not appreciated the true extent of that ambition.

Part of it's laid out in the National Security Strategy, a document in which 
each administration outlines its approach to defending the country. The Bush 
administration plan, released Sept. 20, marks a significant departure from 
previous approaches, a change that it attributes largely to the attacks of 
Sept. 11.

To address the terrorism threat, the president's report lays out a newly 
aggressive military and foreign policy, embracing pre-emptive attack against 
perceived enemies. It speaks in blunt terms of what it calls "American 
internationalism," of ignoring international opinion if that suits U.S. 
interests. "The best defense is a good offense," the document asserts.

It dismisses deterrence as a Cold War relic and instead talks of "convincing 
or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities."

In essence, it lays out a plan for permanent U.S. military and economic 
domination of every region on the globe, unfettered by international treaty 
or concern. And to make that plan a reality, it envisions a stark expansion 
of our global military presence.

"The United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western 
Europe and Northeast Asia," the document warns, "as well as temporary access 
arrangements for the long-distance deployment of U.S. troops."

The report's repeated references to terrorism are misleading, however, 
because the approach of the new National Security Strategy was clearly not 
inspired by the events of Sept. 11. They can be found in much the same 
language in a report issued in September 2000 by the Project for the New 
American Century, a group of conservative interventionists outraged by the 
thought that the United States might be forfeiting its chance at a global 
empire.

"At no time in history has the international security order been as 
conducive to American interests and ideals," the report said. stated two 
years ago. "The challenge of this coming century is to preserve and enhance 
this 'American peace.' "

Familiar themes

Overall, that 2000 report reads like a blueprint for current Bush defense 
policy. Most of what it advocates, the Bush administration has tried to 
accomplish. For example, the project report urged the repudiation of the 
anti-ballistic missile treaty and a commitment to a global missile defense 
system. The administration has taken that course.

It recommended that to project sufficient power worldwide to enforce Pax 
Americana, the United States would have to increase defense spending from 3 
percent of gross domestic product to as much as 3.8 percent. For next year, 
the Bush administration has requested a defense budget of $379 billion, 
almost exactly 3.8 percent of GDP.

It advocates the "transformation" of the U.S. military to meet its expanded 
obligations, including the cancellation of such outmoded defense programs as 
the Crusader artillery system. That's exactly the message being preached by 
Rumsfeld and others.

It urges the development of small nuclear warheads "required in targeting 
the very deep, underground hardened bunkers that are being built by many of 
our potential adversaries." This year the GOP-led U.S. House gave the 
Pentagon the green light to develop such a weapon, called the Robust Nuclear 
Earth Penetrator, while the Senate has so far balked.

That close tracking of recommendation with current policy is hardly 
surprising, given the current positions of the people who contributed to the 
2000 report.

Paul Wolfowitz is now deputy defense secretary. John Bolton is 
undersecretary of state. Stephen Cambone is head of the Pentagon's Office of 
Program, Analysis and Evaluation. Eliot Cohen and Devon Cross are members of 
the Defense Policy Board, which advises Rumsfeld. I. Lewis Libby is chief of 
staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. Dov Zakheim is comptroller for the 
Defense Department.

'Constabulary duties'

Because they were still just private citizens in 2000, the authors of the 
project report could be more frank and less diplomatic than they were in 
drafting the National Security Strategy. Back in 2000, they clearly 
identified Iran, Iraq and North Korea as primary short-term targets, well 
before President Bush tagged them as the Axis of Evil. In their report, they 
criticize the fact that in war planning against North Korea and Iraq, "past 
Pentagon wargames have given little or no consideration to the force 
requirements necessary not only to defeat an attack but to remove these 
regimes from power."

To preserve the Pax Americana, the report says U.S. forces will be required 
to perform "constabulary duties" -- the United States acting as policeman of 
the world -- and says that such actions "demand American political 
leadership rather than that of the United Nations."

To meet those responsibilities, and to ensure that no country dares to 
challenge the United States, the report advocates a much larger military 
presence spread over more of the globe, in addition to the roughly 130 
nations in which U.S. troops are already deployed.

More specifically, they argue that we need permanent military bases in the 
Middle East, in Southeast Europe, in Latin America and in Southeast Asia, 
where no such bases now exist. That helps to explain another of the 
mysteries of our post-Sept. 11 reaction, in which the Bush administration 
rushed to install U.S. troops in Georgia and the Philippines, as well as our 
eagerness to send military advisers to assist in the civil war in Colombia.

The 2000 report directly acknowledges its debt to a still earlier document, 
drafted in 1992 by the Defense Department. That document had also envisioned 
the United States as a colossus astride the world, imposing its will and 
keeping world peace through military and economic power. When leaked in 
final draft form, however, the proposal drew so much criticism that it was 
hastily withdrawn and repudiated by the first President Bush.

Effect on allies

The defense secretary in 1992 was Richard Cheney; the document was drafted 
by Wolfowitz, who at the time was defense undersecretary for policy.

The potential implications of a Pax Americana are immense.

One is the effect on our allies. Once we assert the unilateral right to act 
as the world's policeman, our allies will quickly recede into the 
background. Eventually, we will be forced to spend American wealth and 
American blood protecting the peace while other nations redirect their 
wealth to such things as health care for their citizenry.

Donald Kagan, a professor of classical Greek history at Yale and an 
influential advocate of a more aggressive foreign policy -- he served as 
co-chairman of the 2000 New Century project -- acknowledges that likelihood.

"If [our allies] want a free ride, and they probably will, we can't stop 
that," he says. But he also argues that the United States, given its unique 
position, has no choice but to act anyway.

"You saw the movie 'High Noon'? he asks. "We're Gary Cooper."

Accepting the Cooper role would be an historic change in who we are as a 
nation, and in how we operate in the international arena. Candidate Bush 
certainly did not campaign on such a change. It is not something that he or 
others have dared to discuss honestly with the American people. To the 
contrary, in his foreign policy debate with Al Gore, Bush pointedly 
advocated a more humble foreign policy, a position calculated to appeal to 
voters leery of military intervention.

For the same reason, Kagan and others shy away from terms such as empire, 
understanding its connotations. But they also argue that it would be naive 
and dangerous to reject the role that history has thrust upon us. Kagan, for 
example, willingly embraces the idea that the United States would establish 
permanent military bases in a post-war Iraq.

"I think that's highly possible," he says. "We will probably need a major 
concentration of forces in the Middle East over a long period of time. That 
will come at a price, but think of the price of not having it. When we have 
economic problems, it's been caused by disruptions in our oil supply. If we 
have a force in Iraq, there will be no disruption in oil supplies."

Costly global commitment

Rumsfeld and Kagan believe that a successful war against Iraq will produce 
other benefits, such as serving an object lesson for nations such as Iran 
and Syria. Rumsfeld, as befits his sensitive position, puts it rather 
gently. If a regime change were to take place in Iraq, other nations 
pursuing weapons of mass destruction "would get the message that having them 
. . . is attracting attention that is not favorable and is not helpful," he 
says.

Kagan is more blunt.

"People worry a lot about how the Arab street is going to react," he notes. 
"Well, I see that the Arab street has gotten very, very quiet since we 
started blowing things up."

The cost of such a global commitment would be enormous. In 2000, we spent 
$281 billion on our military, which was more than the next 11 nations 
combined. By 2003, our expenditures will have risen to $378 billion. In 
other words, the increase in our defense budget from 1999-2003 will be more 
than the total amount spent annually by China, our next largest competitor.

The lure of empire is ancient and powerful, and over the millennia it has 
driven men to commit terrible crimes on its behalf. But with the end of the 
Cold War and the disappearance of the Soviet Union, a global empire was 
essentially laid at the feet of the United States. To the chagrin of some, 
we did not seize it at the time, in large part because the American people 
have never been comfortable with themselves as a New Rome.

Now, more than a decade later, the events of Sept. 11 have given those 
advocates of empire a new opportunity to press their case with a new 
president. So in debating whether to invade Iraq, we are really debating the 
role that the United States will play in the years and decades to come.

Are peace and security best achieved by seeking strong alliances and 
international consensus, led by the United States? Or is it necessary to 
take a more unilateral approach, accepting and enhancing the global 
dominance that, according to some, history has thrust upon us?

If we do decide to seize empire, we should make that decision knowingly, as 
a democracy. The price of maintaining an empire is always high. Kagan and 
others argue that the price of rejecting it would be higher still.

That's what this is about.

Iraqi Parliament Condemns U.N. Plan

By SAMEER N. YACOUB
Associated Press Writer

Arif says his client, John Lee Malvo, is a juvenile who's having difficulty 
coping with being in jail. (Audio)

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi lawmakers denounced a tough, new U.N. resolution 
on weapons inspections Monday as dishonest, provocative and worthy of 
rejection - despite the risk of war. But parliament said it ultimately will 
trust whatever President Saddam Hussein decides.

One after the other, senior lawmakers rejected the resolution, the latest in 
a long effort to ensure Iraq scraps its weapons of mass destruction. This 
time, however, the United States and Britain have made clear they will 
attack Iraq if it does not fully comply.

Parliament speaker Saadoun Hamadi said the resolution was stacked with "ill 
intentions", "falsehood", "lies" and "dishonesty." Salim al-Koubaisi, head 
of parliament's foreign relations committee, recommended rejecting the 
resolution but also advised deferring to the "wise Iraqi leadership" to act 
as it sees fit to defend Iraq's people and dignity.

"The committee advises ... the rejection of Security Council Resolution 
1441, and to not agree to it in response to the opinions of our people, who 
put their trust in us," al-Koubaisi told fellow lawmakers.

Saddam has used parliament's action as cover for difficult decisions in the 
past, and harsh rhetoric does not necessarily mean parliament will reject 
the proposal. Saddam ordered parliament to recommend a formal response, and 
lawmakers were expected to vote on recommendations for the Iraqi leadership 
Tuesday.

According to the resolution, Iraq has until Friday to accept or reject the 
resolution, approved unanimously last week by the U.N. Security Council.

U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said there are numerous interpretations for the 
deadline - the minute the resolution was adopted, the minute Iraq was 
notified, the end of business Friday, or midnight on Friday. It is up to the 
Security Council to interpret its own resolution, Eckhard said.

Anne Power, a spokeswoman with the British mission at the United Nations, 
said Britain intepreted the deadline to be seven 24-hour periods from the 
minute the resolution was adopted. That would mean that Iraq has until 10:17 
a.m. EST Friday, Nov. 15 to respond. Other Security Council members could 
have different interpretations however. Chinese deputy ambassador Zhang 
Yishan, the current council president, said he was checking on the exact 
deadline.

If Saddam fails to follow through, a Pentagon plan calls for more than 
200,000 troops to invade Iraq.

Parliament's advice on the new U.N. resolution, which demands Iraq cooperate 
with U.N. weapons inspectors or face "serious consequences," will go to the 
Revolutionary Command Council, Iraq's ruling body headed by Saddam.

Should parliament recommend acceptance, it would allow Saddam to claim the 
decision was the will of the Iraqi people and more smoothly retreat from 
previous objections to any new resolution governing weapons inspections.

In Washington, President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, 
rejected the legitimacy of the parliament debate.

"One has to be a bit skeptical of the independence of the Iraqi parliament 
from Saddam Hussein," she said. "I don't think anyone believes this is 
anything but an absolute dictatorship and this decision is up to Saddam 
Hussein."

She also said Iraq has no right to accept or reject the resolution. "They 
are obligated to accept, but the U.N. thought it best to ask for 
return-receipt requested," Rice said.

On Sunday, Arab League foreign ministers ended meetings in Cairo, Egypt, 
with a final communique urging cooperation between Iraq and the United 
Nations. The Arab ministers also called on the United States to commit to 
pledges Syria said it received that the resolution could not be used to 
justify military action. They also put forward a united position of 
"absolute rejection" of military action.

In a statement Monday, Saudi Arabia urged the Iraqis to accept the 
resolution "in order not to provide any opportunity for harm to come to the 
Iraqi people."

Parliament is stacked with Saddam's allies. During opening speeches aired 
live on Iraqi television. lawmakers applauded every mention of Saddam's name 
in speeches praising "His Excellency Mr. President, the holy warrior leader 
Saddam Hussein."

Wafa Samir, a 30-year-old teacher, watched the speeches on television at a 
Baghdad shopping center. "For how long will they keep issuing resolutions 
and expect Iraq to implement them?" she asked. "They have to stop some time 
for the Iraqis' sake."

On convening the session, Hamadi, the parliament speaker, told lawmakers the 
resolution "does not have the minimum of fairness, objectivity and balance," 
and violates international law.

"The ill intentions in this resolution are flagrant and loud in ignoring all 
the work that has been achieved in past years ... and takes the issue back 
to square one," Hamadi said. "This resolution includes many impossible 
demands that can't be executed."

Iraq maintains it no longer has any weapons of mass destruction. Lawmaker 
Ismail Nasif Jassim called the 30-day period for Iraq to provide documents 
on its weapons programs "illogical and a way to provoke Iraq."

The U.N. resolution gives inspectors unrestricted access to any suspected 
weapons site and the right to interview Iraqi scientists outside the country 
and without Iraqi officials present - both issues that could become points 
of dispute.

Jassim called the provision for interviewing scientists "a violation of 
human rights because it demands of any Iraqi they want to interview to 
travel abroad with their family."

Iraq has insisted on respect for its sovereignty, an argument it has used in 
the past to restrict access to Saddam's palaces.

"Whoever formulated the text of that resolution deliberately chose (points) 
that contradict Iraq's sovereignty and conflict with the dignity of the 
people," Hamadi said.

Saeed Mousawi, a senior official at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, noted the 
resolution had changed the rules by expanding the inspectors' powers to 
decide where to go and whom to interview. "This decision creates a wide 
ground for upcoming crises, and not for a solution," he told the parliament.

Subject:The African Roots of the War<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The African Roots of the War
W.E.B. DuBois
May, 1915

�Semper novi quid ex Africa,� cried the Roman proconsul; and he voiced the 
verdict of forty centuries.  Yet there are those who would write world 
history and leave out this most marvelous of continents.  Particularly 
to-day most men assume that Africa lies far afield from the centers of our 
burning social problems, and especially from our present problem of World 
War.

Yet in a very real sense Africa is a prime cause of this terrible 
overturning of civilization which we have lived to see; and these words seek 
to show how in the Dark Continent are hidden the roots, not simply of war 
to-day but of the menace of wars tomorrow.

Always Africa is giving us something new or some metempsychosis of a 
world-old thing.  On its black bosom arose one of the earliest, if not the 
earliest, of self-protecting civilizations, and grew so mightily that it 
still furnishes superlatives to thinking and speaking men.  Out of its 
darker and more remote forest fastnesses, came, if we may credit many recent 
scientists, the first welding of iron, and we know that agriculture and 
trade flourished there when Europe was a wilderness.

Nearly every human empire that has arisen in the world, material and 
spiritual, has found some of its greatest crises on this continent of 
Africa, from Greece to Great Britain.  As Mommsen says, �It was through 
Africa that Christianity became the religion of the world.�  In Africa the 
last flood of Germanic invasions spent itself within hearing of the last 
gasp of Byzantium, and it was again through Africa that Islam came to play 
its great role of conqueror and civilizer.

With the Renaissance and the widened world of modern thought, Africa came no 
less suddenly with her new old gift.  Shakespeare�s Ancient Pistol cries�

�A foutre for the world, and worldlings base!
I speak of Africa, and folden joys�.�

So much for the past; and now to-day: the Berlin Conference to apportion the 
rising riches of Africa among the white peoples met on the fifteenth day of 
November, 1884.  Eleven days earlier, three Germans left Zanzibar (whither 
they had gone secretly disguised as mechanics), and before the Berlin 
Conference had finished its deliberations they had annexed to Germany an 
area over half as large again as the whole German Empire in Europe.  Only in 
its dramatic suddenness was this undisguised robbery of the land of seven 
million natives different from the methods by which Great Britain and France 
got four million square miles each, Portugal three quarters of a million, 
and Italy and Spain smaller but substantial areas.

The methods by which this continent has been stolen have been contemptible 
and dishonest beyond expression.  Lying treaties, rivers of rum, murder, 
assassination, mutilation, rape, and torture have marked the progress of 
Englishman, German, Frenchman, and Belgian on the dark continent.  The only 
way in which the world has been able to endure the horrible tale is by 
deliberately opping its ears and changing the subject of conversation while 
the deviltry went on.

It all began, singularly enough, like the present war, with Belgium.  Many 
of us remember Stanley�s great solution of the puzzle of Central Africa when 
he traced the mighty Congo sixteen hundred miles from Nyangwe to the sea.  
Suddenly the world knew that here lay the key to the riches of Central 
Africa.  It stirred uneasily, but Leopold of Belgium was first on his feet, 
and the result was the Congo Free State�God save the mark!  But the Congo 
Free State, with all its magniloquent heralding of Peace, Christianity, and 
Commerce, degenerating into murder, mutilation and downright robbery, 
differed only in degree and concentration from the tale of all Africa in 
this rape of a continent already furiously mangled by the slave trade.  That 
sinister traffic, on which the British Empire and the American Republic were 
largely built, cost black Africa no less than 100,000,000 souls, the 
wreckage of its political and social life, and left the continent in 
precisely that state of helplessness which invites aggression and 
exploitation.  �Color� became in the world�s thought synonymous with 
inferiority, �Negro� lost its capitalization, and Africa was another name 
for bestiality and barbarism.

Thus the world began to invest in color prejudice.  The �Color Line� began 
to pay dividends.  For indeed, while the exploration of the valley of the 
Congo was the occasion of the scramble of Africa, the cause lay deeper.  The 
Franco-Prussian War turned the eyes of those who sought power and dominion 
away from Europe.  Already England was in Africa, cleaning away the debris 
of the slave trade and half consciously groping toward the new Imperialism.  
France, humiliated and impoverished, looked toward a new northern African 
empire sweeping from the Atlantic to the Red Sea.  More slowly Germany began 
to see the dawning of a new day, and, shut out from America by the Monroe 
Doctrine, looked to Asia and Africa for colonies.  Portugal sought anew to 
make good her claim to her ancient African realm; and thus a continent where 
Europe claimed but a tenth of the land in 1875, was in twenty-five more 
years practically absorbed.


Why was this?  What was the new call for dominion?  It must have been 
strong, for consider a moment the desperate flames of war that have shot up 
in Africa in new call for dominion?�

The answer to this riddle we shall find in the economic changes in Europe.  
Remember what the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have meant to organized 
industry in European civilization.  Slowly the divine right of the few to 
determine economic income and distribute the goods and services of the world 
has been questioned and curtailed.  We called the process Revolution in the 
eighteenth century, advancing Democracy in the nineteenth, and Socialization 
of Wealth in the twentieth.  But whatever we call it, the movement is the 
same: the dipping of more and grimier hands into the wealth-bag of the 
nation, until to-day only the ultra stubborn fail to see that Democracy in 
determining income is the next inevitable step to Democracy in political 
power.

With the waning of the possibility of the Big Fortune, gathered by 
starvation wage and boundless exploitation of one�s weaker and poorer 
fellows at home, arose more magnificently the dream of exploitation abroad.  
Always, of course, the individual merchant had at his own risk and in his 
own way tapped the riches of foreign lands.  Later, special trading 
monopolies had entered the field and founded empires over-seas.  Soon, 
however, the mass of merchants at home demanded a share in this golden 
stream; and finally, in the twentieth century, the laborer at home is 
demanding and beginning to receive a part of his share.

The theory of this new democratic despotism has not been clearly formulated. 
  Most philosophers see the ship of state launched on the broad, 
irresistible tide of democracy, with only delaying eddies here and there: 
others, looking closer, are more disturbed.  Are we, they ask, reverting to 
aristocracy and despotism�the rule of might?  They cry out and then rub 
their eyes, for surely they cannot fail to see strengthening democracy all 
about them?

It is this paradox which has confounded philanthropists, curiously betrayed 
the Socialists, and reconciled the Imperialists, and captains of industry to 
any amount of �Democracy.� It is this paradox which allows in America the 
most rapid advance of democracy to go hand in hand in its very centers with 
increased aristocracy and hatred toward darker races, and which excuses and 
defends an inhumanity that does not shrink from the public burning of human 
beings.

Yet the paradox is easily explained: the white workingman has been asked to 
share the spoil of exploiting �chinks and niggers.�  It is no longer simply 
the merchant prince, or the aristocratic monopoly, or even the employing 
class, that is exploiting the world: it is the nation; a new democratic 
nation composed of united capital and labor.  The laborers are not yet 
getting, to be sure, as large a share as they want or will get, and there 
are still at the bottom large and restless excluded classes.  But the 
laborer�s equity is recognized, and his just share is a matter of time, 
intelligence and skillful negotiation.

Such nations it is that rule the modern world.  Their national bond is no 
mere sentimental patriotism, loyalty, or ancestor-worship.  It is increased 
wealth, power, and luxury for all classes on a scale the world never saw 
before.  Never before was the average citizen of England, France, and 
Germany so rich, with such splendid prospects of greater riches.

Whence comes this new wealth and on what does its accumulation depend?  It 
comes primarily from the darker nations of the world�Asia and Africa, South 
and Central America, the West Indies and the islands of the South Seas.  
There are still, we may well believe, many parts of white countries like 
Russia and North America, not to mention Europe itself, where the older 
exploitation still holds.  But the knell has sounded faint and far, even 
there.  In the lands of darker fold, however, no knell has sounded.  
Chinese, East Indians, Negroes, and South American Indians, are by common 
consent for governance by white folk and economic subjection to them.  To 
the furtherance of this highly profitable economic dictum has been brought 
every available resource of science and religion.  Thus arises the 
astonishing doctrine of the natural inferiority of most men to the few, and 
the interpretation of �Christian brotherhood� as meaning anything that one 
of the �brothers� may at any time want it to mean.

Like all world-schemes, however, this one is not quite complex.  First of 
all, yellow Japan has apparently escaped the cordon of this color bar.  This 
is disconcerting and dangerous to white hegemony.  If, of course, Japan 
would join heart and soul with the whites against the rest of the yellows, 
browns, and blacks, well and good.  There are even good-natured attempts to 
prove the Japanese �Aryan,� provided they act �white.�  But blood is thick, 
and there are signs that Japan does not dream of a world governed mainly by 
white men.  This is the �Yellow Peril,� and it may be necessary, as the 
German Emperor and many white Americans think, to start a world-crusade 
against this presumptuous nation which demands �white� treatment.

Then, too, the Chinese have recently shown unexpected signs of independence 
and autonomy, which may possibly make it necessary to take them into account 
a few decades hence.  As a result, the problem in Asia has resolved itself 
into a race for �spheres� of economic �influence,� each provided with a more 
or less �open door� for business opportunity.  This reduces the danger of 
open clash between European nations, and gives the yellow folk such chance 
for desperate unarmed resistance as was shown by China�s repulse of the Six 
Nations of Bankers.  There is still hope among some whites that conservative 
North China and  the radical South may in time come to blows and allow 
actual white dominion.

One thing, however, is certain:  Africa is prostrate.  There at least are 
few signs of self-consciousness that need at present be heeded.  To be sure, 
Abyssinia must be wheedled, and in America and the West Indies Negroes have 
attempted futile steps toward freedom; but such steps have been pretty 
effectually stopped (save through the breech of �miscegenation�), although 
the ten million Negroes in the United States need, to many men�s minds, 
careful watching and ruthless repression.


Thus the white European mind has worked, and worked the more feverishly 
because Africa is the Land of the Twentieth Century.  The world knows 
something of the gold and diamonds of South Africa, the cocoa of Angola and 
Nigeria, the rubber and ivory of the Congo, and the palm oil of the West 
Coast.  But does the ordinary citizen realize the extraordinary economic 
advances of Africa and, too, of black Africa, in recent years?�There can be 
no doubt of the economic possibilities of Africa in the near future.  There 
are not only the well-known and traditional products, but boundless chances 
in a hundred different directions, and above all, there is a throng of human 
beings who, could they once be reduced to the docility and steadiness of 
Chinese coolies or of seventeenth and eighteenth century European laborers, 
would furnish to their masters a spoil exceeding the gold-haunted dreams of 
the most modern of Imperialists.

This, then, is the real secret of that desperate struggle for Africa which 
began in 1877 and is now culminating.  Economic dominion outside Africa has, 
of course, played its part, and we were on the verge of the partition of 
Asia when Asiatic shrewdness warded it off.  America was saved from direct 
political dominion by the Monroe Doctrine.  Thus, more and more, the 
Imperialists have concentrated on Africa.

The greater the concentration the more deadly the rivalry.  From Fashoda to 
Agadir, repeatedly the spark has been applied to the European magazine and a 
general conflagration narrowly averted.  We speak of the Balkans as the 
storm-center of Europe and the cause of war, but this is mere habit.  The 
Balkans are convenient for occasions, but the ownership of materials and men 
in the darker world is the real prize that is setting the nations of Europe 
at each other�s throats today.

The present world war is, then, the result of jealousies engendered by the 
recent rise of armed national associations of labor and capital whose aim is 
the exploitation of the wealth of he world mainly outside the European 
circle of nations.  These associations, grown jealous and suspicious at the 
division of the spoils of trade-empire, are fighting to enlarge their 
respective shares; they look for expansion, not in Europe but in Asia, and 
particularly in Africa.  �We want no inch of French territory,� said Germany 
to England, but Germany was �unable to give� similar assurances as to France 
in Africa.

The difficulties of this imperial movement are internal as well as external. 
  Successful aggression in economic expansion calls for a close union 
between capital and labor at home.  Now the rising demands of the white 
laborer, not simply for wages but for conditions of work and a voice in the 
conduct of industry, make industrial peace difficult.  The workingmen have 
been appeased by all sorts of essays in state socialism, on the one hand, 
and on the other hand by public threats of competition by colored labor.  By 
threatening to send English capital to China and Mexico, by threatening to 
send English capital to China and Mexico, by threatening to hire Negro 
laborers in America, as well as by old-age pensions and accident insurance, 
we gain industrial peace at home at the mightier cost of war abroad.

In addition to these national war-engendering jealousies there is a more 
subtle movement arising from the attempt to unite labor and capital in 
world-wide freebooting.  Democracy in economic organization, while an 
acknowledged ideal, is today working itself out by admitting to a share in 
the spoils of capital only the aristocracy of labor�the more intelligent and 
shrewder and cannier workingmen.  The ignorant, unskilled, and restless 
still form a large, threatening, and to a growing extent, revolutionary 
group in advanced countries.

The resultant jealousies and bitter hatreds tend continually to fester along 
the color line.  We must fight the Chinese, the laborer argues, or the 
Chinese will take our bread and butter.  We must keep Negroes in their 
places, or Negroes will take our jobs.  All over the world there leaps to 
articulate speech and ready action that singular assumption that if white 
men do not throttle colored men, then China, India, and Africa will do to 
Europe what Europe had done and seeks to do to them.

On the other hand, in the minds of yellow, brown, and black men the brutal 
truth is clearing: a white man is privileged to go to any land where 
advantage beckons and behave as he pleases; the black or colored man is 
being more and more confined to these parts of the world where life for 
climatic, historical, economic, and political reasons is most difficult to 
live and most easily dominated by Europe for Europe�s gain.


What, then, are we to do, who desire peace and the civilization of all men?  
Hitherto the peace movement has confined itself chiefly to figures about the 
cost of war and platitudes on humanity.  What do nations care about the cost 
of war, if by spending a few hundred millions in steel and gunpowder they 
can gain a thousand millions in diamonds and cocoa?  How can love of 
humanity appeal as a motive to nations whose love of luxury is built on the 
inhuman exploitation of human beings, and who, especially in recent years, 
have been taught to regard these human beings, as inhuman?  I appealed to 
the last meeting of peace societies in St. Louis, saying, �Should you not 
discuss racial prejudice as a prime cause of war?�  The secretary was sorry 
but was unwilling to introduce controversial matters!

We, then, who want peace, must remove the real causes of war.  We have 
extended gradually our conception of democracy beyond our social class to 
all social classes in our nation; we have gone further and extended our 
democratic ideals not simply to all classes of our own nation, but to those 
of other nations of our blood and lineage�to what we call �European� 
civilization.  If we want real peace and lasting culture, however, we must 
go further.  We must extend the democratic ideal to the yellow, brown and 
black peoples.

To say this, is to evoke on the faces of modern men a look of blank 
hopelessness.  Impossible! We are told, and for some many 
reasons�scientific, social and what not�that argument is useless.  But let 
us not conclude too quickly.  Suppose we have to choose between this 
unspeakably inhuman outrage on decency and intelligence and religion which 
we call the World War and the attempt to treat black men as human, sentient, 
responsible beings?  We have sold them as cattle.  We are working them as 
beasts of burden.  We shall not drive war from this world until we treat 
them as free and equal citizens in a world-democracy of all races and 
nations.  Impossible?  Democracy is a method of doing the impossible.  It is 
the only method yet discovered of making the education and development of 
all men a matter of all men�s desperate desire.  It is putting firearms in 
the hands of a child with the object of compelling the child�s neighbors to 
teach him, not only the real and legitimate uses of a dangerous tool but the 
uses of himself in all things.  Are there other and less costly ways of 
accomplishing this?  There may be in some better world.  But for a world 
just emerging from the rough chains of an almost universal poverty, and 
faced by the temptation of luxury and indulgence through the enslaving of 
defenseless men, there is but one adequate method of salvation�the giving of 
democratic weapons of self-defense to the defenseless.

Nor need we quibble over those ideas,--wealth, education, and political 
power�soil which we have so forested with claim and counter-claim that we 
see nothing for the woods.

What the primitive peoples of Africa and the world need and must have if war 
is to abolished is perfectly clear:

First: land.  Today Africa is being enslaved by the theft of her land and 
natural resources�.

Second: we must train native races in modern civilization.  This can be 
done.  Modern methods of educating children, honestly and effectively 
applied, would make modern, civilized nations out of the vast majority of 
human beings on earth today.

Lastly, the principle of home rule must extend to groups, nations, and 
races.  The ruling of one people for another people�s whim or gain must 
stop.  This kind of despotism has been in later days more and more 
skillfully disguised.  But the brute fact remains: the white man is ruling 
black Africa�. Can such a situation bring peace?  Will any amount of 
European accord or disarmament settle this injustice?

Political power today is but the weapon to force economic power.  Tomorrow, 
it may give us spiritual vision and artistic sensibility.  Today, it gives 
us or tries to give us bread and butter, and those classes or nations or 
races who are without starve, and starvation is the weapon of the white 
world to reduce them to slavery.

We are calling for European concord today; but at the utmost European 
concord will mean satisfaction with, or acquiescence in, a given division of 
the spoils of world-dominion.  After all, European disarmament cannot go 
below the necessity of defending the aggressions of the white against the 
black and browns and yellows.  From this will arise three perpetual dangers 
of war.  First, renewed jealousy at any division of colonies or sphere of 
influence agreed upon, if at any future time the present division comes to 
seem unfair.  Who cared for Africa in the early nineteenth century?  Let 
England have the scraps left from the golden feast of the slave trade.  But 
in the twentieth century?  The end was war.  These scraps looked too 
tempting to Germany.  Secondly: war will come from the revolutionary revolt 
of the lowest workers.  The greater the international jealousies, the 
greater the corresponding costs of armament and the more difficult to 
fulfill the promises of industrial democracy in advanced countries.  
Finally, the colored peoples will not always submit passively to foreign 
domination.  To some this is a lightly tossed truism.  When a people deserve 
liberty they fight for it and get it, say such philosophers; thus making war 
a regular, necessary step to liberty.  Colored people are familiar with this 
complacent judgement.  They endure the contemptuous treatment meted out by 
whites to those not �strong� enough to be free.  These nations and races, 
composing as they do a vast majority of humanity, are going to endure this 
treatment just as long as they must and not a moment longer.  Then they are 
going to fight and the War of the Color Line will outdo in savage inhumanity 
any war this world has yet seen.  For colored folk have much to remember and 
they will not forget.

But is this inevitable?  Must we sit helpless before this awful prospect?  
While we are planning, as a result of the present holocaust, the disarmament 
of Europe and a European international world-police, must the rest of the 
world be left naked to the inevitable horror or war, especially when we know 
that it is directly in this outer circle of races, and not in the inner 
circle of European households, that the real causes of present European 
fighting are to be found?

Our duty is clear.  Racial slander must go.  Racial prejudice will follow.  
Steadfast faith in humanity must come.  The domination of one people by 
another without the other�s consent, be the subject people black or white, 
must stop.  The doctrine of forcible economic expansion over subject peoples 
must go.  Religious hypocrisy must stop.  �Blood-thirsty� Mwanga of Uganda 
killed an English bishop because he feared that his coming meant English 
domination.  It did mean English domination, and the world and the bishop 
knew it, and yet the world was �horrified�!  Such missionary hypocrisy must 
go.  With clean hands and honest hearts we must front high Heaven and beg 
peace in our time.

In this great work who can help us?  In the Orient, the awakened Japanese 
and the awakening leaders of New China; in India and Egypt, the young men 
trained in Europe and European ideals, who now form the stuff that 
Revolution is born of.  But in Africa?  Who better than the twenty-five 
million grandchildren of the European slave trade, spread though the 
Americas, and now writhing desperately for freedom and a place in the world? 
  And of these millions first of all the ten million black fold of the 
United States, now a problem, then a world-salvation.

Twenty centuries before the Christ a great cloud swept over sea and settled 
on Africa, darkening and well-nigh blotting out the culture of the land of 
Egypt.  For half a thousand years it rested there until a black woman, Queen 
Nefertari, �the most venerated figure in Egyptian history,� rose to the 
throne of the Pharoahs and redeemed the world and her people.  Twenty 
centuries after Christ, black Africa, prostrate, raped, and shamed, lies at 
the feet of the conquering Philistine of Europe.  Beyond the awful sea a 
black woman is weeping and waiting with her sons on her breasts.  What shall 
the end be?  The world-old and fearful things, War and Wealth, Murder and 
Luxury?  Or shall it be a new thing�a new peace and new democracy of all 
races: a great humanity of equal men?  �Semper novi quid ex Africa!�


unite the many, defeat the few!

Wednesday, November 13, 2002 is the National Day of Action to Divest from
Israeli Apartheid. Across the country, campus and community activists are
organizing events and activities to demand that their universities divest
from investment in Israel, corporations stop doing business with Israel, and
our government cease tax-funded aid to Israel. So long as our dollars go
toward perpetuating the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and
the oppression of the Palestinian people, we are forced to be complicit in
that oppression. We say: Not in our name! Please see the Day of Action
website at http://november13.pathbot.com/ for information on actions across
the country.

Here in New Brunswick, New Jersey, New Jersey Solidarity activists and
Rutgers University students will protest STARBUCKS COFFEE at 391 George
Street in downtown New Brunswick, NJ from 12 noon-1 pm on Wednesday,
November 13! Throughout the US and around the world, Starbucks has been
targeted for boycott by those seeking justice in Palestine. In addition to
Starbucks' overall shoddy corporate record, Starbucks chairman Harold
Schultz is an active Zionist and champion of Israel. He has worked actively
as a propagandist for the Israeli foreign ministry (which has praised him
for his efforts in presenting the Israeli view on various campuses), and has
been awarded "The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award" by the Jerusalem
Fund of Aish HaTorah. In addition, Starbucks has numerous stores operating
in Israel and is looking toward expanding its Israeli presence.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign sends our most heart felt condolences to 
Juan Segarra Palmer, a Puerto Rican Political Prisoner, and his family for 
the recent loss of his father, Don Juan Enrique Segarra Irizarry.

Don Juan passed away in Florida, where he had moved several months ago to 
recover from a stroke he had in September and to be closer to his son Juan 
Segarra, who is incarcerated in FCI Coleman.


We send our well wishes, condolences and love to Juan and his family.  We 
ask that the movement in solidarity with the Puerto Rican Political 
Prisoners send a letter, post card or note to Juan letting him know that at 
this time he is supported and loved.  You can write to Juan at:

Juan Segarra Palmer
#15357-077
FCI Coleman Med.
P.O. Box 1032
Coleman, FL 33521

This is a translated article on Don Juan from El Nuevo Dia:

Juan Enrique Segarra Irizarry, father of Juan Segarra Palmer, who is serving 
a federal sentence for the 1983 robbery of Wells Fargo Company truck in 
Hartford, Connecticut, died this past Saturday without being able to see his 
son, family members stated.

Family members denounced the fact that Segarra Irizarry died Saturday in the 
state of Florida where he spent the last two weeks of his life waiting to be 
given a special permit to visit his son in prison.

In the face of this situation, the family sent a letter to La Fortaleza 
asking that Puerto Rico Governor Sila M. Calderon intervene so that the 
prisoner be granted a special pass on humanitarian grounds so that he may be 
present at his fathers burial. Segarra Palmer�s family said that at the same 
time they will also be appealing to the Catholic Church to help to 
facilitate their petition.

Segarra Irizarry died at the age of 81, due to cancer related complications 
and his body has been viewed since Saturday in open casket in the Ehret 
Funeral Parlor in Rio Piedras.  He will be buried will be tomorrow 
(Wednesday, November 13) in the Cemetery of Old San Juan.

Segarra Irizarry is survived by his sons Luis Alberto, Antonio Virgilio and 
Adela Josefina.

Segarra Palmer was sentenced in 1989 to 65 years in prison for his 
participation in the million-dollar robbery of a charted Wells Fargo truck.

The so-called National Liberation Army, better known as Los Macheteros, 
assumed responsibility for the robbery, which netted more than 7 million 
dollars and which according to U.S. historical documentaries, is classified 
as one of the 10 most spectacular robberies which has taken place on U.S. 
territory.

Since his sentencing, Segarra Palmer has been incarcerated in various 
federal jails and in recent years he was transferred to the Federal 
Correctional Center at Coleman, Florida.

In 1999, when then U.S. President Bill Clinton granted conditional amnesty 
to a group of prisoners arrested for their participation in this robbery, it 
was determined that Segarra Palmer would be able to ask for parole in 
September of 2003.

With great sadness we inform you that early this morning 5 year-old
Milivi Adams died. This little girl from Vieques had been battling
several types of cancer product of the contamination from the USA
military exercises in her island. Her parents, Zuleyka Calderon and
Jose Adams, had brought her to Philadelphia for treatment in
Children's Hospital. Earlier this week, her doctors said that there
was no more they could do to restore Milivi's health.

Funds are urgently needed for the return trip home of Milivi and her
family. They need to get back by next Tuesday, November 19. Please
donate whatever you can. If you are in the Philadelphia area, please

Farouk Abdel Muhti has been in jail for more than six months. He needs
our help if he is to regain his freedom in the near future. There have been 
many cases of immigrants held by the INS for years. We do not want this to 
happen to Farouk. We are demanding that the INS free him NOW!

This Saturday, November 23, we will march to the INS building in Newark
to demand Farouk's freedom. To get there simply take the Path train which 
goes to Newark at 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. The trip takes 
less than an hour and the fare is $1.50. We will congregate in front of Penn 
Station and Market Street in Newark at 12:30 pm. The INS building is just 
seven blocks away.  We hope you can find a couple of hours for this 
important event. Please forward this message.

Thanks,

Daniel Vila

************************************

New York-area Palestinian activist Farouk Abdel
Muhti, who has lived in the US for more than 24
years, has been held in jail by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service for seven months. He is not
charged with any crime; he is being held allegedly
on the  basis of a 1995 deportation order-even
though the INS been unable to deport stateless
Palestinians like Farouk.

Since his arrest on April 26, he has lost considerable weight,
his eyesight has deteriorated and is taking medicine for high
blood pressure. Farouk sometimes has problems with
bleeding.

Farouk was clearly arrested for political reasons. In March of
this year he began working regularly at WBAI-FM,
arranging interviews with Palestinian spokespeople at a time
when the Israeli military was invading West Bank cities and
towns.

His legal team has demanded his release pursuant to
the Supreme Court's 2001 decision in Zadvydas v. Davis,
which limits detention to six months for most immigrants
facing deportation. But public pressure will be the decisive
factor in freeing Farouk.

Saturday, November 23 12:30 PM
March from Newark Penn Station to the Federal
Building at Broad Street and Court.
New Yorkers can take the Path train at 33rd Street and 6th Avenue to
Newark (fare is $1.50).We will march two blocks to Broad Street and four 
blocks to the Peter W. Rodino Jr. Federal Building, which is just one block 
from Newark's City Hall.

<pre>hey peoples campaigners,

attached below is the first email of a long succession
of emails regarding a December 7th peace train to
Newark. the train leaves at 11:38 from new brunz, but
people will be at the train station trying to inform
the commuting public about the war situation and the
reasons why there shouldn't be one.

it looks like they regularly send emails out to
progressive egroups but i guess not to
nbpeoplescampaign??!!

the key contacts for the peace train info are tina
weishaus (weishaus@...) and bob witanek
(bwitanek@...)

but for a more personal contact, try marc shapiro at

Station Organizers 
Hello All!

There has been significant response from the New
Brunswick area of folks who
plan to attend the December 7 Peace Train march
through New Brunswick
Against the War on Iraq - and to attend a local feeder
rally at the train
station that morning.

Tina Weishaus has agreed to try to help coordinate the
New Brunswick train
station rally.  mailto:weishaus@...

If you are interested in participating
organizationally or individually,
please contact her, especially if you plan to
participate organizationally,
want to have a speaker (very brief as the whole rally
at New B station will
be 30 - 40 minutes before the train arrival), want to
endorse, want to help
get fliers out, etc.

I am not familiar with all of the New Brunswick  /
Rutgers list serves so if
this information is appropriate on any other lists you
participate in,
please forward it out.

Thanks!

- Bob

NEW BRUNSWICK: Along with a movie star, Olympic medal winner and
congresswoman, New Brunswick High School valedictorian Angela Salazar ranks 
as one of the 11 women of the year according to Latina magazine.


Home News Tribune/June

Angela Salazar
Valedictorian is now a Woman of the Year


Salazar, who made headlines in June by demanding to deliver her commencement 
speech in English and Spanish, is featured in the magazine along with 
actress Salma Hayek, pop star Shakira, Olympic speed skater Jennifer 
Rodriguez and California Rep. Loretta Sanchez.

"The mujeres (women) you're about to meet did more than just open doors in 
2002. They tore them down," reads the introduction to the six-page spread in 
the December issue of Latina. The issue, with Jennifer Lopez on the cover, 
hit racks nationwide this week.

Salazar, now a freshman biology major at Montclair State University, said 
she was honored but somewhat surprised to be on the list.

"That's something very special. They are comparing me to people who go 
around the world and represent Hispanic culture," said Salazar. "They're big 
stars. It feels good to be compared to them."

Salazar, who spoke little English when she arrived here from Ecuador four 
years ago, wanted to deliver her valedictory in English and Spanish. She 
said a bilingual speech would benefit audience members at a ceremony for a 
high school where 40 percent of the students speak Spanish as their native 
language.

Citing tradition, school officials rebuffed Salazar's request, saying the 
speech must be primarily in English. Officials eventually acquiesced -- a 
decision opposed by some fellow graduates who turned their backs on Salazar 
during the June 24 bilingual speech.

Latina chose to honor Salazar and 10 other women for making a difference in 
their communities or industries, said magazine spokeswoman Carolina A. 
Miranda.

"It took real guts to do what she did -- stand up to school officials -- and 
for something she truly believed in. The fact that she was so young made it 
even more impactful to the editors here at Latina, especially since we're a 
bilingual magazine," said Miranda, who put the publication's readership at 
1.2 million.

The list in Latina also includes a principal, author, playwright, 
politician, garment worker and activist fighting domestic violence.

On page 89, Salazar is pictured in her commencement cap and gown delivering 
her speech. The seven sentences of English text discuss Salazar's insistence 
on saying her address in both languages after school officials said no. 
Under the heading "Why She Rules," the magazine states, "She threatened to 
sue the school board. Not surprisingly, officials reversed their decision."

Superintendent of Schools Ronald F. Larkin, who had tangled with the
valedictorian about the speech, said the magazine article was a tribute to 
Salazar, her family and the school district.

"We take some pride in her accomplishments. She's, after all, a graduate of 
New Brunswick High School," Larkin said. "We hope to share in many more 
achievements with her in the future."

He declined to talk about the speech controversy.

"I think our statements in the past should be left in the past," Larkin 
said.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>    
    Build the Work for Reparations to the African Community! 

    The Nov. 16-17th events on Reparations to the African community were a 
great success.   They included the Nov. 16th Hearing on Truth Reconciliation 
and Reparations to the African Community that featured a line up of educators 
and activists who detailed the violent history of America and this area in 
particular that fostered  the economic exploitation and genocide of African 
people. The hearing was sponsored by the African People’s Solidarity Commit
tee (APSC) an organization based in the white community that works under 
the leadership of the Uhuru Movement. (See the article on pg. 18 of the 
Nov.10,  2002 issue of the Phila. Weekly.) 
    Sun. Nov. 17th the International People’s Democratic Uhuru Movement held 
a powerful conference that brought together a broad spectrum of African 
people and organizations who are working on many different fronts to make 
Reparations  a reality.
     A special thanks everyone who came out and participated, the speakers, 
volunteers, the donors, and all of you.  These events are part of an ongoing 
process to use international law and community organizing to expose  the 
injustices against African people and to rectify the terrible crimes against 
African people perpetrated by the U.S. government and white society. 
    We urge everyone to come out and help build this important work by coming 
to one of the following meetings.
 
Monday Dec. 2nd 6-8pm
Robin’s Bookstore
108 S. 13th st.
Center City Phila. 
More info 215-552-8722
(and every first and 3rd Monday)
APSC calls on white people to take the campaign for Truth Reconciliation and 
Reparations to the African community out into the white population.

Wednesday Dec. 4th 7:30pm 
Uhuru House 1021 S. 49th st. at Chester
Southwest Phila. 
more info 215-724-3535
This is the first meeting of the organizing committee to build for the World 
Tribunal on Reparations for African People in the U.S. to be held in Phila. 
Nov. 15-16, 2003. Tribunal meetings will be held the first Wednesday of every 
month.

Come to regular meetings every Wed. at
Uhuru house 1021 S. 49th St.

28 November, 2002
Special Report from the Peace and Justice Camp

A member of the Horseman for Peace on Vieques informed us of military 
activities visible from different points on the island during the past two 
weeks.  Following is the information offered:

"...Yesterday morining I spoke with a friend working on a construction site 
close to the fence at Monte Carmelo (next to the Navy base), and he 
commented that last week he saw around 30 soldiers walking on the military 
road next to the fence, all with their backpacks, possibly some type of an 
exercise, since they were very well equipped.  They walked in single file, 
two groups of five in front, escorted by a pick up truck in front and behind 
the group.  This could also be some type of reconnaisance of the fence area 
to try to impede the disobedience - something they cannot do."


This same "compa�ero" informed us a few days ago that from the public beach, 
Sun Bay, helicopters could be seen carrying out "rescue" type exercises in 
waters close to the South Coast of Vieques.

This information describes the context of the recent incident at the Luisa 
Guadalupe Camp in which military helicopters flew so low over the area that 
pieces of zinc, wood and other materiales were blown about, causing injuries 
to several members of the camp.

These unannounced maneuvers are training activities of the Special 
Operations Forces - South, of the Southern Command, relocated two years ago 
to Roosevelt Roads after many years operating from Panama.  According to the 
Environmental Evaluation related to the transfer to Puerto Rico of SOCSOUTH, 
this brigade specializes in Psychological Warfare, among other areas of 
expertise.

 &gt; ACTION ALERT:
 &gt; HBO Recycling Gulf War Hoax?
 &gt;
 &gt; December 4, 2002
 &gt;
 &gt; The fraudulent story of Iraqi soldiers throwing Kuwaiti babies out of
 &gt; incubators during the occupation of Kuwait in 1990 is depicted as if it
 &gt; were true in "Live from Baghdad," the HBO film premiering on the cable
 &gt; network this Saturday that purports to tell the story behind CNN's
 &gt; coverage of the Gulf War.  HBO and CNN are both owned by the AOL Time
 &gt; Warner media conglomerate.
 &gt;
 &gt; In the months before the Gulf War began, media uncritically repeated the
 &gt; claim that Iraqi soldiers were removing Kuwaiti babies from incubators.
 &gt; The story was launched by the testimony of a 15-year-old Kuwaiti girl
 &gt; before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in October 1990.  
Eventually,
 &gt; as repeated in the media by the first President Bush and countless 
others,
 &gt; it blossomed into a tale involving over 300 Kuwaiti babies.
 &gt;
 &gt; What was not reported at the time was the fact that the public relations
 &gt; company Hill &amp; Knowlton was partly behind the effort, and the girl who
 &gt; testified was actually the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to
 &gt; Washington.  Subsequent investigations, including one by Amnesty
 &gt; International, found no evidence for the claims (ABC World News Tonight,
 &gt; 3/15/91).
 &gt;
 &gt; In the film, the story is turned upside down, portrayed as a deft public
 &gt; relations move by the Iraqi government, who grant CNN access to Kuwait in
 &gt; a calculated attempt to discredit the rumors that their soldiers were
 &gt; pulling babies from incubators.  CNN reporters are ushered to a hospital
 &gt; in Kuwait, where a doctor, under obvious pressure from Iraqi soldiers,
 &gt; tells the reporters that no babies had been pulled from the incubators.
 &gt;
 &gt; The CNN team does not believe the obviously nervous doctor is telling the
 &gt; truth, and the Iraqi officials pick up on this, promptly cutting the
 &gt; interview short.  The scene ends with the doctor being led away by Iraqi
 &gt; officials.  Moments later, the CNN crew listens to a BBC report on the
 &gt; radio that suggests that CNN had debunked the story of Iraqi soldiers
 &gt; killing Kuwaiti babies, and CNN's reporters are upset that they've been
 &gt; used by the Iraqi officials.
 &gt;
 &gt; The key exchange happens as follows:
 &gt;
 &gt; ------
 &gt; CNN correspondent: You are aware of the allegations, doctor?
 &gt; Doctor:  I have heard these stories.
 &gt; CNN producer Ingrid Formanek (whisper): This sucks. He's scared.
 &gt; CNN producer Robert Wiener (whisper): Yeah, this is bad.
 &gt; Doctor: I can tell you, nothing has happened at this hospital... that I
 &gt; know.
 &gt; Correspondent: But at other hospitals?
 &gt; Doctor: I cannot tell about other hospitals.
 &gt; Iraqi handler: Finish! Finish! We go now!
 &gt; Formanek: To the other hospitals?
 &gt; Handler: No, back to Baghdad!
 &gt; Wiener: Hey, hey, that was part of the deal!
 &gt; Handler: That is story.
 &gt; ------
 &gt;
 &gt; The clear implication is that the CNN reporters were used by the Iraqi
 &gt; government to make a true story of atrocities seem false.  A review of 
the
 &gt; movie in the Indianapolis Star (12/1/02) arrived at that very conclusion,
 &gt; noting that CNN "played into the Iraqis' hands on a couple of occasions,
 &gt; including an ill-fated trip to Kuwait where the Iraqis used the CNN crew
 &gt; to counter reports that their soldiers had been removing Kuwaiti babies
 &gt; from hospital incubators and leaving them on the floor to die."
 &gt;
 &gt; "Live from Baghdad" is a dramatization, not a documentary, but it is 
being
 &gt; presented by HBO as a "behind-the-scenes true story" of the Gulf War and
 &gt; is being released at a crucial political moment.  HBO's version of 
history
 &gt; never makes clear that the incubator story was fraudulent, and in fact 
had
 &gt; been managed by an American PR firm, not Iraq.  Curiously, however, the
 &gt; truth seems to have been clear to Robert Wiener, the former CNN producer
 &gt; who co-wrote "Live from Baghdad."  As he explained to CNN's Wolf Blitzer
 &gt; (11/21/02), "that story turned out to be false because those accusations
 &gt; were made by the daughter of the Kuwaiti minister of information and were
 &gt; never proven."
 &gt;
 &gt; Unfortunately, HBO viewers won't know that when they see the film.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; ACTION:
 &gt; Let HBO know you are concerned about the distortion of history in their
 &gt; movie "Live From Baghdad." With another war with Iraq looming, HBO could
 &gt; better serve viewers by debunking wartime propaganda, instead of 
re-airing
 &gt; it.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>from the Central NJ Coalition to Stop the War on Iraq



----Original Message Follows----
From: "Bob Witanek" &lt;bwitanek@...&gt;
To: &lt;bwitanek@...&gt;
Subject: Tis the Season to STOP THE WAR!
Date: Sun, 8 Dec 2002 22:23:25 -0500

What Next?  Eve of Christmas / Eve of War!

Tis not be the season to be jolly and there is nothing to "Fa la la" about.

The New York Times reports today that the US has almost enough "heavy tanks,
warships, aircraft, bombs and troops in the Persian Gulf region to enable it
to begin an attack against Iraq sometime in January."

In my view, one of the reasons the US was in agreement to wait for a UN
process instead of attacking sooner is simple logistics - they wanted to get
their ducks in a row anyway and they played it off as if they are looking
for consensus - so they could be ready to hit real hard right from the
start.  Most are probably aware that the US has been real busy lining up
NATO support and approaching over 100 countries with financial enticements
and veiled threats to get them to join its gang of aggressors against Iraq.

It has already been reported that the US is preparing its next full court
press on the UN to declare Iraq in breach, reportedly not to immediately
attack but to ratchet up the inspections regime, recruiting dozens more
inspectors and conducting more aggressive, simultaneous inspections, etc.
Certainly, as soon as the generals notify the commander in chief that they
are fully prepared, a breach will be declared by the US with likely
acquiescence from other nations.

Many who celebrate Christmas have their noses in mail order catalogues and
are chasing around at the malls.  Meanwhile, the US is inching closer and
closer toward full-scale warfare, invasion, occupation and takeover of the
nation of Iraq (and of course the $1 trillion oil prize).

On the heels of the very successful Peace Train march and rally in Newark,
the NJ Coalition Against War on Iraq (http://www.NoWarNJ.org ) is calling
upon groups and individuals to organize vigils, rallies, marches, etc., in
as many locations around the state of NJ as possibly during the days of
December 19 - 22, in what we are calling the Eve of Christmas / Eve of War
actions.  We call upon activists, regardless of their faiths and of whether
they celebrate Christmas to participate.  We must ALL demand that ALL
Americans take pause during this season that is supposed to be dedicated to
peace and love for fellow humanity to call upon the government to
immediately halt the war build up and Iraq invasion plans.

Already, there are events scheduled in about 1 dozen locations.  There
should be potential for such events in many dozen if not over 100 locations
around the state.  Bring it to your group today and get something going.  It
does not need to be immense.  If you have something that you are doing
already, we will help you make it more successful for that weekend.  We can
help you by publicizing the event and providing you with contacts in your
area who could be open to participating.

It is not time to sit back and say - well we had a big march - now we can
take a break.  The war is on and the clock is ticking toward the forward
charge order.  Instead it is time to do whatever we can to harness whatever
momentum there is from the December 7 successful event into even greater
success through local actions throughout the state during the Eve of
Christmas / Eve of War events, December 19 - 22.

Make your commitment:

Send replies to mailto:bwitanek@... , njsane@... and
cfpa@... .

Please respond IMMEDIATELY!

Yes, I want to participate in an event against the war during the dates
December 19 - 22.  ___

Yes, I will help organize such an event in my neighborhood or a nearby
neighborhood. ____
