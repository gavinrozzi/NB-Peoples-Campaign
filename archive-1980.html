&gt; &gt; &gt;I know neither one of these (the original or the response) are about the
&gt; &gt; &gt;NBPC but...Um, Paul, are you on Crack?  Did you notice the Nader has 3-6%
&gt; &gt; &gt;in each area?  Gore may not be this "serial killer, et al" that you called
&gt; &gt; &gt;Bush, but he is a LIAR!  An outright, flaming, liar...he doesn't even know
&gt; &gt; &gt;what he did and did not do -- can I just site the Internet as just ONE
&gt; &gt; &gt;example out of many contradictions/outright lies he has told?  If the
&gt; &gt; &gt;Republicans win, this country will drop like a rock and maybe it'll be
&gt; &gt; &gt;easier to fight back from dead zero than to sit on the crap we have had for
&gt; &gt; &gt;the past 8 years in the White House.

&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Dear Mr. Nader and Campaign Staff:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I write visceral and blunt urgings for your organization to reexamine
&gt; &gt; &gt;your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;role in the presidential election.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I submit the following as cause to back out of the race at this eleventh
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hour:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1.  George Bush is a serial killer, a chronic privatizer, and an
&gt; &gt; &gt;incoherent
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;babbler. Al Gore is not. The first two facts have most impact for
&gt; &gt; &gt;minorities
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;who have never had the franchise in this country. Those minorities are
&gt; &gt; &gt;not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;voting Nader this year.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;2.  Al Gore is inextricably tied to the Democratic Party, making him
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;accountable to local organizations around the country, not just finance
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;capital. That's what makes a party, independent local organizations. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have to beat dems and reps in local elections to have a snowball's chance
&gt; &gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hell to win nationally.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;3.  I think it's clear that your party will not win its five percent
&gt; &gt; &gt;popular
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;vote to get federal funds, so why run anymore? There are no more gains to
&gt; &gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;made for the national Green Party at this point.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;4.  Lastly, I cite the example of Rudy "sans the little moustache"
&gt; &gt; &gt;Ghouliani
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in NYC. Rudy ran against Dinkins in '94. Many of the same "Left" groups
&gt; &gt; &gt;who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;support Nader for President ran massive publicity campaigns against
&gt; &gt; &gt;Dinkins.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;These groups mainly called Dinkins a sellout, sd he wasn't revolutionary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;enough, called him a Tom, etc.  Dinkins was not a serial killer, a
&gt; &gt; &gt;chronic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;privatizer, an undying friend of the most reactionary sectors of finance
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;capital since Weimar Germany-- but Herr Giuliani is!!!  So these
&gt; &gt; &gt;so-called
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Left groups succeeded in knocking down Dinkins so much that fascist
&gt; &gt; &gt;Giuliani
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;got elected.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Don't make the same mistake that these lefties made.  Make no mistake,
&gt; &gt; &gt;Bush
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;likes fascism. Let's not confuse party-building with spoiler politics.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

Actually, this is the point.  The People's Campaign can win the election. secondly if
we lose it is the same people in office who would have been there anyway.  The point
is we have a fail safe in New Brunswick.  We can not lose anything.  A vot for the
People's Campaign is not a protest, it is actaully a vote to remove those who we
usually have to protest to.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What a wonderful line of thinking!  In fact, you've just about justified
&gt; why not to vote for the People's Campaign.

&gt; &gt;Oct. 28, 2000 | Oh yes: Along the way, I stayed out of the 1968 vote -- and
&gt; &gt;therefore, in the light of unforgiving history, did my tiny bit to help
&gt; &gt;Nixon win, and all for the best of reasons, namely, emotions in revolt,
&gt; &gt;disgust for Humphrey's pro-war position, and willful blindness about the
&gt; &gt;left's marginality and the political payoff that could be expected for
&gt; &gt;going it alone.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; (Matthew writes:) A preface:  I believe this is a reference to
&gt; anti-war/civil-rights movement people who opted agianst the "lesser of two
&gt; evils" line, (much like the Nader-ites/Greens) thereby ushering in Nixon,
&gt; and the ensuing widespread FBI surveillance, infiltration and systematic
&gt; dismantling of leftist, progressive and revolutionary organizations form
&gt; Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to Labor Unions to the
&gt; Black Panther Party for Self-Defense (AKA: CoIntelPro).  If anyone knows
&gt; more about this, please speak up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;We come to the claim that a Nader vote is costless because his candidacy
&gt; &gt;creates its own constituency, bringing masses hitherto demobilized (and
&gt; &gt;rationally so) out of the woodwork. Turnout is surely important, especially
&gt; &gt;for the unregistered blue-collar voters, but waiting for a rescue mission
&gt; &gt;from suddenly lefty voters is the political equivalent of the beam-me-up
&gt; &gt;wishfulness practiced by millennial cults -- and it has the same function.
&gt; &gt;The trouble is, there's no persuasive evidence that large numbers of voters
&gt; &gt;have been staying home because they've lacked a left-wing alternative.
&gt; &gt;That's not the country we're living in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; (Matthew) Right and wrong:  Nader's campaign has certainly been rushed. I
&gt; received an email at the beginning of this summer that Nader was "really in
&gt; it this time".  I was wondering where he had been for the last 3 1/2 years
&gt; since his last run (read:walk) for presidency. And this gets to my biggest
&gt; criticism of the Green Party/Nader campaign: They're trying to go for the
&gt; head (ie: the throne) before they build up the body (a real mass movement)
&gt; But, this is where our author friend goes wrong.  There's an immense amount
&gt; of evidence that voters have been staying home for lack of a candidate that
&gt; truly represents their interests.  First of all, the huge rallies of support
&gt; that Nader has been getting is the most immediate indicator.  Also, most
&gt; people are simply not benifiting from this golden-calf economy.  All the
&gt; corporate downsizing means that countless people are put out of work, real
&gt; wages are far lower than they were 20 or 30 years ago, job security is
&gt; practically nonexistant, more people are working 2 and 3 jobs without the
&gt; benifits, and if you haven't noticed the lack of democracy in the inner
&gt; cities, then reconsider the meriad of marches and protests against police
&gt; brutality in cities all over the country...these are people for whom
&gt; low-income housing is being replaced with prisons.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Then, on practical grounds, we hear that a Nader vote builds up popular
&gt; &gt;support for the Greens so they can get to 5 percent and therefore receive
&gt; &gt;federal funds in 2004. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that Nader does
&gt; &gt;get 5 percent, and the Greens get federal funds in future elections. Then
&gt; &gt;what? On the off-chance that the Greens can avoid breaking into warring
&gt; &gt;camps, � la the Reform Party, what they can realistically look forward to
&gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt;someday becoming, say, an 8 percent party. And then? After at least one
&gt; &gt;term
&gt; &gt;of Republican rule, with its unambiguous passion for big oil, against a
&gt; &gt;nuclear test ban, for Star Wars, against labor organizing, for HMO's, for
&gt; &gt;kindness toward the Pinochets of the world, etc., maybe eight years on we
&gt; &gt;get to -- 9 percent? 11 percent? The odds are for shrinkage, not increase,
&gt; &gt;in a third party. This is a doomed enterprise.
&gt;
&gt; This is where our author really lets his cynicism get the best of him.  The
&gt; fact is that it would be an amazing and historic leap foward if the Greens
&gt; got 5% of the vote (guaranteed Bush looses) But until Nov 7th at 8pm, this
&gt; is amounts to reckless speculation and fantasizing for a quick solution to
&gt; our country's deep social and economic problems.  IT AMOUNTS TO PLAYING
&gt; RUSSIAN ROULLET WITH THE LIVES OF THE MOST VULNERABLE SECTIONS OF OUR
&gt; POPULATION WHO WILL BE TROUNCED BY A BUSH VICTORY!
&gt;
&gt; But we do indeed need a legitamate 3rd party movement. Again, the
&gt; Green/Nader campaign should have been building up a UNITED FRONT/COALITION
&gt; grassroots movement for the last 4 years, buy they haven't.  I saw Nader &amp;
&gt; Co. speak in Newark last week, and to be brutally honest, the audience
&gt; didn't look a thing like Newark! It was primarily marginalized middle-class
&gt; lefties from the 'burbs who came to Newark to declair themselves the
&gt; People's Choice!  Bull-shit! Newark has a such deep and broad history of
&gt; political and social struggle, countless community organizations that have
&gt; for years taken on the "powers that be" fighting for more democracy and
&gt; community control over the city's institutions.  Why weren't they
&gt; represented?  The only Newark organization that I saw was the People's
&gt; Organization for Progress, which has historically struggled against police
&gt; brutality in Essex County and beyond.  A true third party movement has to
&gt; include the entire spectrum of grassroots organizations, labor unions,
&gt; student organizations, etc, etc. not one group or party to jump up at the
&gt; 11th hour and play savior at the risk of fucking us all for the next four
&gt; years and more!
&gt;
&gt; The Constitution is
&gt; &gt;decisively tilted against it. In parliamentary systems, a single-digit
&gt; &gt;party
&gt; &gt;can win seats, enter governments, make policy -- as witness the Greens in
&gt; &gt;Germany and elsewhere in Europe. But in the American winner-take-all
&gt; &gt;presidential system -- which is not going away -- the payoff for a
&gt; &gt;third-party effort is the chance to be a spoiler again.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is true and extremely important as we consider what it will mean to
&gt; democratize the United States.  The only possible way that we can create the
&gt; scope of change that is called for is to have a political aperatus
&gt; completely entrenched in a broad based mass movement that is prepared to
&gt; back up a call, let's say to abolish the Electoral College, or for that
&gt; matter, the millionare's club called the Senate!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does voting for a third party contribute to "building a movement"? Claims
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt;this sort are always made by charismatic figures. The results are never --
&gt; &gt;never -- delivered. The claim amounts to feel-good rhetoric to rationalize
&gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt;heady campaign. Tomorrow never comes. It is a parochial fantasy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Too true, too true!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Nader's claim that he's not the spoiler is bad faith. Perhaps he knows it,
&gt; &gt;perhaps not. But there is a deeper force at work. What is at work in the
&gt; &gt;Naderite camp, what lies behind the fantasy that the masses hanker for
&gt; &gt;radical change, is a purist approach to politics.
&gt;
&gt; Check it out: At the Nader forum, that jerk who's running for NJ Senate for
&gt; the Greens, Bruce Afrin, had the nerve to get up on stage and moralize about
&gt; Corzine trying to buy a Senate seat (no kidding), claiming it would be
&gt; better to have an "honest conservative"!  I quote: "I will be proud if my
&gt; campaign causes Jon Corzine to lose the election" Afrin's lucky he didn't
&gt; leave the Brick City with a brick up side his head.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The arrogance of this "worsism" -- the worse, the better -- is chillingly
&gt; &gt;expressed by a Nader voter in Portland, Ore., interviewed in Friday's New
&gt; &gt;York Times: "If Bush gets in, I feel that it might bring things to a head
&gt; &gt;much more quickly. Pollution's going to increase in the short term, but I
&gt; &gt;think that will bring a lot more people into the environmental movement a
&gt; &gt;lot more quickly. Sometimes you've got to hit bottom before you come back
&gt; &gt;up." Notice how the means -- "a lot more people into the environmental
&gt; &gt;movement" -- has become the end. Notice the spurious assumption that the
&gt; &gt;masses will rise up if things come "to a head." It didn't happen after
&gt; &gt;Reagan's depredations on the environment. It won't happen now.
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, this really get me too.  It's very telling that so many Nader
&gt; supporters that I speak to make this claim, to-wit: Even if Nader causes
&gt; Bush to win, it will bring the revolution on because people will have a
&gt; clear enemy.   This is more "quick sollution"-ism!  An instant movement in
&gt; Nader, and if not, an instant movement in Bush!  This is sort of impatient
&gt; and whimsical "organizing" is dangerous and stupid.  It is put out by people
&gt; who don't want to commit to the real, bare-knuckels, down-to-earth,
&gt; day-to-day struggle to build a strong, sustainable movement, And, dare I
&gt; say, it is a line put out by people who generally have access to at least
&gt; basic resources and modest levels of democracy--who aren't worst hit by the
&gt; lack of democracy that is supposed to usher in the up-rising.  Look, if
&gt; people are out of work, they will be tired most of the time just trying to
&gt; make ends meet and feed the kids, probably too tired to fight.  However,
&gt; more democracy, such as low unemployment and strong unions empowers people
&gt; and gives them strength and the idea that they can win...therefor they will
&gt; fight harder.  Same goes for inner cities where less democracy means more
&gt; people in prison, schools falling apart, and more CIA-shipped drugs on the
&gt; street.  I've never heard any of these folks say, "Heck, I hope that cop
&gt; comes over here and wacks me with his billy-club...THEN the revolution will
&gt; come!"
&gt;
&gt; As for the
&gt; &gt;Nader movement, it's well-meaning and broad but an inch deep. In Eric
&gt; &gt;Alterman's trenchant words in the Nation, Nader's "nascent leftist movement
&gt; &gt;has virtually no support among African-Americans, Latinos or
&gt; &gt;Asian-Americans. It has no support among organized feminist groups,
&gt; &gt;organized gay rights groups or mainstream environmental groups. To top it
&gt; &gt;all off, it has no support in the national union movement. So Nader and
&gt; &gt;company are building a nonblack, non-Latino, non-Asian, nonfeminist,
&gt; &gt;nonenvironmentalist, nongay, non-working people's left: Now that really
&gt; &gt;would be quite an achievement."
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Once again: A real (and future) third party movement must represent all of
&gt; these forces and more.  It must be a coalition based united front of
&gt; democratic people, classes, businesses, organizations, parties, and anyone
&gt; else who will join in the historic effort to sieze political power away from
&gt; the international corporate powers that Nader so elloquently admonishes.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;True enough, after getting a boost from his "the people vs. the powerful"
&gt; &gt;convention speech, Gore moved fitfully toward the center, and one can fight
&gt; &gt;against his position on capital punishment and prisons, his trimming on gun
&gt; &gt;control -- dispute all this and more far more effectively if he is
&gt; &gt;president
&gt; &gt;than not.
&gt;
&gt; All this said, let it be known that I am voting AGAINST the phycopathic
&gt; Shrub and for Gore.  I congradulate Nader for bringing issues to the table
&gt; that may not otherwise have been brought up in the mainstream media.  But I
&gt; don't for a minute think that the Whore-Gore will represent the people's
&gt; wishes any more than his punk imperialist predecesor, Clinton, did.  WE MUST
&gt; BUILD THE INDEPENDANT POLITICAL PARTY MOVEMENT at the local level and build
&gt; up from there!
&gt;
&gt; So, to wrap up:  1) Keep Bush and his extreme right constituency out of
&gt; office on Nov. 7  2) Keep Gore beholden to his consituency as long as
&gt; possible (unions, black churches, environmental org.'s etc) but know that he
&gt; can't be trusted either, ultimately, &amp; 3) GET BUSY!!! Organize in your
&gt; neighborhood, on your block, at work, in school, wherever you can in
&gt; anticipation that the next election is right around the corner, and we're
&gt; going to have to be ready.  Rememeber, there are NO QUICK FIXES!
&gt;
&gt; And if you're still reading this, then your probably interested enough to
&gt; want to know that in New Brunswick, we're preparing to take the majority in
&gt; City Council on election day!  Our truly grass-roots People's Campaign has a
&gt; multi-national ticket running on a revolutionary-democratic platform, and
&gt; we've been campaigning even longer that Nader ;) in NB to fundamentally
&gt; transform and democratise NB.  AND WE NEED HELP!  If you can come down for
&gt; the day on Tuesday, Nov. 7th, or even for a few hours to help us get out the
&gt; vote, it may make all the difference in this race...for more info, email me,
&gt; or call the Headquarters at (732) 545-5756.

I think that this crisis in bourgeois democracy provides us a great
opportunity to advance direct democracy.  A poll published in todays
papers cited 80% of the population is oppossed to the electorial
college. Agitation, Education, and organization around this call could
be very effective.

more study is that usually the protection of the minority from tyranny of the majority
has little to do with protecting national or ethinic minorities and more to do with
protecting the property owning minority.
NJFO is orgainizing a discussion/study group on the electorial college.  On friday
dec. 1.  The idea is to come together to look at the history and the various lines on
the electorial college.

&gt; &gt; The slogan of revolutionary democracy should be
&gt; &gt; "Abolish the electorial college, let the popular vote decide!"
&gt;
&gt; I'm still an agnostic on this question.  Here's why.  I'm not 100%
&gt; certain that deemphasizing the state-by-state electoral vote system in
&gt; favor of 'letting the popular vote decide' will be empowering to those
&gt; places where the least politically powerful live.  To put it simply,
&gt; is this strategically good for the political interests of the rural
&gt; poor and the urban poor alike?
&gt;
&gt; Let's say you have state A and state B, and both traditionally go to
&gt; the Democrats because of their large urban minority population,
&gt; combined with, say, a large number of traditionally Democratic groups
&gt; living in the suburbs (Catholics and Jews, for example).  This might
&gt; roughly describe NY and NJ; I'm not thinking too hard here, though, so
&gt; let's just keep it hypothetical.  The Republicans won't really even
&gt; bother with these two states, usually, because the urban votes and
&gt; some of the suburban votes will outweigh the more conservative
&gt; suburban and rural voters by, maybe, 10%.
&gt;
&gt; Switch to direct election and you get this:  the Republicans will
&gt; suddenly campaign vigorously to get the conservative votes from those
&gt; two states, and be able to combine those votes to make them count
&gt; nationally in a way they never could before.
&gt;
&gt; This is just a (not that great) hypothetical.  But you get my point.
&gt; There's just as much possibility for a swing in favor of the
&gt; Republicans as there is in favor of the Democrats.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I think that this crisis in bourgeois democracy provides us a great
&gt; &gt; opportunity to advance direct democracy.  A poll published in todays
&gt; &gt; papers cited 80% of the population is oppossed to the electorial
&gt; &gt; college. Agitation, Education, and organization around this call
&gt; &gt; could be very effective.
&gt;
&gt; Well, first, 'direct democracy' in the sense of eliminating mediating
&gt; factors between the individual voter and Congress, the President, etc,
&gt; isn't necessarily a great thing.  It's definitely an excessive
&gt; exaggeration to call it 'revolutionary'.
&gt;
&gt; Here's how I'd look at it.  Progressive reforms, in the traditional
&gt; sense of the term 'Progressive', have always been quite
&gt; well-intentioned in terms of advancing democratic empowerment.  But
&gt; they tend to reduce politics to the rational choice of the individual,
&gt; solitary voter.  The means is seemingly very democratic, but the end
&gt; can _become_ bourgeois-liberal, as you'd say, in the worst sort of
&gt; way.  Think of the primary system: it's arguably become a disaster.
&gt; I'm not saying that Progressive reforms are uniformly 'bad', I'm just
&gt; identifying a problem or a tension that has to be taken seriously.
&gt;
&gt; As a secondary matter, perhaps you should be 'taking up the banner'
&gt; of rank-choice ('Individual Runoff Voting') voting rather than
&gt; worrying so much about the electoral college.  It's my understanding
&gt; that this may actually be workable under the Constitution, whereas the
&gt; abolition of the EC would require an amendment.  It's an uncommonly
&gt; good idea, I think.  You vote for your first choice, second choice,
&gt; and so on.  You can make, in short, Gore your second choice and Nader
&gt; your first; if nobody gets a majority of the votes, the second choices
&gt; are factored in.  In this way, Gore would've won.
&gt;
&gt; TTYL.

<pre>Democracy and the Presidential Elections

     The current crisis surrounding the presidential elections
highlights one of the many undemocratic features of the United States:
the electoral college.  In terms of the popular vote Gore leads Bush 2
by nearly 200,000 votes yet because of the electoral college it is
possible for Bush 2 to become president and lose the popular vote.
     Article Two of the U.S. Constitution explains how the electoral
college works. It also explains how the President will be chosen by the
House of Representatives if no candidate gains a majority of electors.
The move to the House of Representatives rather than to the popular vote
betrays the actual intention of the electoral college which is to
provide a fail safe in case of a popular upsurge against the propertied
interests of the minority.
     This crisis provides us with opportunity to raise the level of
struggle for democracy;  that is one person one vote.  A recent Gallup
poll found that 8 out of 10 people think that the electoral college
should be abolished. The time is ripe for petitions calling for a
national referendum to amend the constitution and abolish the electoral
college.  This struggle would also allow us to call into question other
undemocratic forms like the Senate, and appointed judges. The Senate as
Thomas Jefferson pointed out is based on the British model of a House of
Lords and a House of Commons.
     Not only do we need a third party allied with the middle class but
rooted in the working class, we need to abolish the entire winner take
all system. A parliamentary system where there is representation based
on the percentage of votes won would be a tremendous advance for
revolutionary democracy. This "crisis" is our opportunity.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>     Actually Hitler was well financed by not only the German big bourgeois but also
some Americans (Henry Ford for instance).  An explaination of Hitler's financing is
available in a book called "Who Financed Hitler".  .
     The point that the big bourgeois would prefer bourgeois democracy to outright
dictatorship I think is true.  Just look at them in the US they love to debate among
themselves on all sorts of things.  The reason the big bourgeois supported the
dicatorship of Hitler was first, they feared a working class revolution.  Their fear
was based not only on the victory of the proletariat in the Soviet Union but also on
the fact that the working class had taken state power in Germany in 1918.  Secondly,
Hitler gave the big bourgeois complete control over the economy.  Historically
speaking fascism attacks a retreating working class a kick 'em when their down kind of
thinking. R. Palm Dutt explains this in his book Fascism and Social Revolution.  He
uses the example of Italy, Austria and Germany to make a pretty convincing case.  All
three countries went fascist but only after the working class had  state power within
or in its grasp, only to be betrayed by its social democratic "leaders".
     I think that it is a mistake to say that fascism is the "primacy of politics over
economics".  In fact, I think it would be the other way around.  Fascism is the
outright dictatorship of monopoly capital. Humanity becomes completly subordinated to
the needs of big capital.  The needs of capital in times of severe economic crisis are
most easily met through war;  the destruction of the productive forces as a cure to
the economic crisis which is one of overproduction. Nazism is the most extreme form of
barbarous capitalism because it includes not only war as a means of destruction to
solve the economic crisis but genocide as well.

&gt; These are good points to bring up.
&gt;
&gt; So fascist rule in Germany was not supported by large industry at
&gt; all?  That's an interesting point that I was unaware of.  I was
&gt; probably thinking in terms of the coup in France, which I know more
&gt; about than the Nazi ascension to power.
&gt;
&gt; I believe I am right in saying that the Nazis appealed to the values
&gt; of the small bourgeoisie and agriculture.  The actual historical
&gt; situation may be more nuanced, but is that generally the case?
&gt;
&gt; Something I did forget to elaborate on was the difference between the
&gt; socialist movements at the time and the Nazi movement.  I only touched
&gt; on some ideological differences.  What specifically was the labor
&gt; movement's relationship to the Nazis?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I restrained myself from quoting the whole message.  Let me just
&gt; &gt; respond to one point that I think is important ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; make no mistake: while the fascist leader pays such lip service to
&gt; &gt; &gt; these classes, he is *actually* supported, the entire time, by the
&gt; &gt; &gt; most powerful industrialists.  The gran bourgeoisie, not the
&gt; petite
&gt; &gt; &gt; bourgeoisie, are the ones who abandon liberal democracy and bring
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; a Strongman to restore law and order against the proletariat.
&gt; (For
&gt; &gt; &gt; more on this aspect of fascism, see Karl Marx, 18th Brumaire of
&gt; &gt; Louis
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bonaparte, or Barrington Moore, Social Origins of Dictatorship and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Democracy).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Okay, the problem here is differentiating between 1) The
&gt; relationship
&gt; &gt; between capitalism and fascism at the time of the _creation_ of a
&gt; &gt; dictatorship ... versus 2) The relationship between capitalism and
&gt; &gt; fascism after the dictatorship has been fully established.  In other
&gt; &gt; words, do _capitalists_ intend a dictatorship (1) or do they (2)
&gt; &gt; merely adapt opportunistically to the dictatorship once it is
&gt; &gt; established?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Historically, capitalism adapted comfortably and happily to
&gt; Fascism.
&gt; &gt; But fascism was never intended by the 'big bourgeoisie'.  Especially
&gt; &gt; in Germany.  I'll briefly list the following articles of proof with
&gt; &gt; respect to the Nazis:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1)  The power to appoint the Chancellor (in 1933) stood with a tiny
&gt; &gt; clique of isolated individuals surrounding the aging President
&gt; &gt; Hindenberg.  These included a few trusted old military figures and
&gt; &gt; Hindenberg's son.  Hitler's ascension to power was indeed determined
&gt; &gt; by very contingent political factors, by human choices.  A military
&gt; &gt; dictatorship was all but fated; a Nazi dictatorship was not.  The
&gt; &gt; last Chancellor before Hitler, Kurt von Schleicher, could have
&gt; rather
&gt; &gt; easily lead a military coup, and there might have never been a Nazi
&gt; &gt; dictatorship.  In fact, he seriously considered doing so.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2)  The 'big bourgeoisie' mostly opposed the Nazis, at worst
&gt; &gt; supporting the more authoritarian of the basically liberal (if not
&gt; &gt; fully democratic) parties.  THIS is an important point:  there may
&gt; &gt; have been an element of elitism on the part of many industrialists.
&gt; &gt; But this elitism, paradoxically, looked down upon the Antisemitism
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; the Fascists as vulgar, ugly and stupid.  It may have even been
&gt; &gt; viewed as a phenomenon of 'mob rule'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3)  Many of the industrialists were at the head of industries that
&gt; &gt; benefitted from free trade policies.  The Nazis were shrill in their
&gt; &gt; condemnation of 'free trade'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4)  Exceedingly detailed research has been done on how the Nazi
&gt; party
&gt; &gt; was funded.  All records point to a mass-based funding model much
&gt; &gt; like the Communists and Social Democrats, with greater reliance on
&gt; &gt; money collected from party rallies (which were much more spectacular
&gt; &gt; than those of the SPD or CP).  Industrialists contributed almost
&gt; &gt; nothing; when they contributed at all, it was very late in the game,
&gt; &gt; and only as a kind of desperate bribe.  Only one steel magnate, a
&gt; man
&gt; &gt; by the name of Fritz Thyssen, openly supported and contributed to
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; Nazis.  In 1934, he recanted and fled the country.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is only one argument that would seem at all logical.  It's a
&gt; &gt; bit roundabout.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Industrialists during the Weimar period did _not_ contribute to the
&gt; &gt; Nazis, generally, nor support them.  They _did_, however, contribute
&gt; &gt; to the liberal parties, the left-liberal DDP and the right-liberal
&gt; &gt; DVP, in particular.  In the late 20's, they began to cut back their
&gt; &gt; funding, because they found that they were entirely unable to
&gt; &gt; influence the nation's economic policy through their support of, and
&gt; &gt; contributions to, these parties.  This helped lead to the collapse
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; the centrist parties, and thereby the parties that frequently
&gt; aligned
&gt; &gt; with the SPD to neutralize the Nazis. It also led to the effective
&gt; &gt; collapse of parliamentary rule.  But this hardly amounts to saying
&gt; &gt; that the bourgeoisie wanted fascism.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Otherwise, yes, the bourgeoisie adapted to Fascism just fine.  But
&gt; &gt; Fascism is primarily political; it means the primacy of politics
&gt; over
&gt; &gt; economics, not the other way around.

McGreevy For Governor, New Jersey Must Not Be Bushwhacked

By Keith Joseph

The People's Campaign, progressives, revolutionaries, and anyone
interested in seeing the movement for democracy advance must support
McGreevy this November in the race for governor in New Jersey. Either of
the potential Republican candidates would be a disaster. Not only for
New Jersey but also for the entire nation. The National Republican
leadership has announced that the New Jersey gubernatorial election will
be an opportunity for Bush's appointment as President of the United
States to be legitimated. We can not allow this to happen. We must make
the defeat of the Republicans in this election a protest against Bush's
presidency as well as the electoral college that made it possible.
     The Green Party has threatened to run a candidate despite the fact
Nader's candidacy delivered the people into the bloody hands of Bush.
They continue to posture as progressives yet the results of their
efforts could not be more reactionary. They already assisted in giving
us Bush and now they threaten to do the same in New Jersey.
     Actively participating in McGreevy's campaign would allow the
People's Campaign and progressive forces to build momentum for the local
elections in New Brunswick and Newark in 2002. We will be able to
register voters and also make the connections and build the networks
necessary for our future efforts. The working class and democratic small
businesses, students and professionals are obviously the constituency we
are seeking, it should also be obvious that they are connected in some
way to the Democratic Party. One reason for this is that they understand
the lesser of two evil tactic very clearly. In this country most people
are voting against a politician rather than for one. We too most utilize
the lesser of two evil tactic, as the only way to build our strength,
unity, and organization so that we can actually win democracy. Clearly
and openly uniting with working people and democratic middle classes in
their opposition to Republican reaction at the national and statewide
level is the only path to unity at the local level against Mayor Cahil
in 2002.

&gt;
&gt;  a. Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, the
&gt; governing body of any county or municipality may, by ordinance, or by
&gt; resolution in the case of a county whose charter does not provide for
&gt; the adoption of ordinances, create a body corporate and politic to be
&gt; known as the "Housing Authority of ...," inserting the name of the
&gt; county or municipality. The authority shall constitute an agency and
&gt; instrumentality of the municipality or county creating it. A housing
&gt; authority shall be created pursuant to the procedures of the "Local
&gt; Authorities Fiscal Control Law," P.L.1983, c. 313 (C. 40A:5A-1 et
&gt; seq.). The authority shall consist of seven members. In a county that
&gt; operates under the "county executive plan" set forth in the "Optional
&gt; County Charter Law," P.L.1972, c. 154 (C. 40:41A-1 et seq.), six
&gt; members shall be appointed by the county executive with the advice
&gt; and consent of the board of chosen freeholders, and one member shall
&gt; be appointed by the Commissioner of Community Affairs. In all other
&gt; counties and municipalities, five members shall be appointed by the
&gt; governing body of the county or municipality, as the case may be, one
&gt; by the mayor or other chief executive officer of the municipality, or
&gt; in the case of a county by the director of the board of chosen
&gt; freeholders or by the chief executive officer of the county if the
&gt; county's charter provides for such an officer, and one by the
&gt; Commissioner of Community Affairs. The members shall serve for terms
&gt; of five years and until their respective successors have been
&gt; appointed and qualified; except that of the five members first
&gt; appointed by the governing body one shall be appointed for a term of
&gt; one year, one for a term of two years, one for a term of three years,
&gt; one for a term of four years and one for a term of five years. All
&gt; appointments shall be subject to and made in the manner required by
&gt; the law under which the county or municipality is governed. Vacancies
&gt; shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointments were
&gt; made, but for the unexpired term. If a vacancy is not filled by the
&gt; county executive, governing body or chief executive officer within 90
&gt; days of the occurrence of the vacancy, the Commissioner of the
&gt; Department of Community Affairs shall notify the county executive,
&gt; governing body or chief executive officer of his intent to fill the
&gt; vacancy if it is not filled in 30 days. If the vacancy is not filled
&gt; within that 30 day period, the commissioner may appoint a member for
&gt; the unexpired term.
&gt;  In any county or municipality which has heretofore created a housing
&gt; authority pursuant to R.S. 55:14A-4, the members of the authority who
&gt; were appointed by the governing body and the chief executive officer
&gt; of the county or municipality and who are in office upon the
&gt; effective date of this act shall continue in office until the
&gt; expiration of the terms for which they are appointed and qualified in
&gt; accordance with the terms of this act.
&gt;  b. No municipality which has been included with its consent within
&gt; the area of operation of a county housing authority shall thereafter
&gt; create a municipal housing authority. Where there is no housing
&gt; authority in existence in any municipality of a county, the governing
&gt; body of that county may create a housing authority, and thereafter no
&gt; municipality within that county shall create an authority without the
&gt; consent of the county governing body and the county housing authority.
&gt;  c. A county may provide such publicly assisted housing programs as
&gt; it chooses anywhere within the county; but it may provide such

&gt; resolution of the housing authority consenting thereto.
&gt;  d. No more than one member of a housing authority may be an officer
&gt; or employee of the municipality or county by which the authority is
&gt; created. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any
&gt; member shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality or the
&gt; county, as the case may be, and that certificate shall be conclusive

&gt; shall be entitled to reimbursement for actual expenses necessarily
&gt; incurred in the discharge of the duties of membership, including
&gt; travel expenses. The powers of the authority shall be vested in the
&gt; members thereof in office from time to time. Four members shall

Message:<br><br>
<pre>I thought that this was a good discussion. I advocate Self D and Repartaions and Jim
and I have debated it in the past. The discussion was actaully moving forward, and
many times Jim made the case for Self-D without even meaning to. For insatnce when he
says that the overthrow of reconstruction resulted in "pre-modern classes" taking
control of the Soutrh. That is the point, the relationship of Afro-Americans to the US
is not even at the level that should be achieved in democratic anti-feudal
revolutions. Self-D addresses that very point.
However, to say that Jim's analysis is the same as the Klan is an ultra-left error and
a un- informed remark. First of all,  most people are against reparations that's why
we have to struggle for it; otherwise we would already have it. To say that Jim's
analysis is the same as the Klan (even though you did not call him a Klans man) is
counter-revolutionary because it disorganizes the people rather than organize them.
Instead of drawing revolutionary intellectuals and workers closer togther towards
unity around a common platform it pushes them away towards disunity.
I would take it as an extreme insult if someone were to say I had a line analgous to
the Klan given that I identify as a revolutionary, why would you expect Jim to do
otherwise? How does saying he has a line like the Klan educate him or change his mind
or even just contribute meaningfully to the debate?
This is one particular example of an ultra-left trend of which the attack on Curtis is
but another example. This line is sectarian because it creates an enemy where there
was/should/could be an ally.   The defeat of this ultra-left line and its
rectification along Marxist-Leninist lines will be a geat force towards uniting
revolutionarys in New Brunswick and in New Jersey and will go a long way in  defeating
the local Social-Democrat liberal missionary line that dominates NJFO and the People's
Campaign. If you can not maintain even an alliance with people like Jim and Curtis (to
name but two examples) the movemnt will not grow, no one will be organized and we will
have 5  organizations for four  people. Discussion is a good vehicle to bring
ideological clarity and unity but if discussion is just an excuse to force people to
accept your line with verbal abuse it becomes a servant of imperialsim.

&gt; most definitely robs its national "value".  impedes its economic, political,
&gt; &amp; cultural development.  what is the relationship of benny goodman to jazz,
&gt; of eminem to hiphop, of the nba to allen iverson?  who profit$ from these
&gt; Black national markets?  sony?
&gt;
&gt; if yr serious in understanding these relations, start with dubois "black
&gt; reconstruction" &amp; baraka's "black nation" or listen to some charles mingus.
&gt; yr analysis now is that of the klan.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the basis of imperialism is the rejection of national self-
&gt; &gt;determination &amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the theft of national resources.  your celebrated "modernism" is
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; ideology of Trooper Profiling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;No.  The basis of imperialism is the removal of real value from one
&gt; &gt;country and its transportation into another.  Loss of national
&gt; &gt;sovereignty is incidental to it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I wouldn't call the relationship between corporations in the U.S. and
&gt; &gt;the black ghettos "imperialist."  I read Fanon's book and Huey
&gt; &gt;Newton's interpretation of it.  I mean, you can say that if you like,
&gt; &gt;but it's not very meaningful.  Manufacture and industrialization has
&gt; &gt;long-since left the cities for the most part.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What do you want to say?  Corporations like J&amp;J are stealing national
&gt; &gt;resources from blacks?  Fine, say J&amp;J steals labor power.  I'll agree
&gt; &gt;to that.  But they don't just do it blacks.  That's a class question,
&gt; &gt;not a race question.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have no national relation to sanford st.  however democracy
&gt; &gt;means those
&gt; &gt; &gt; oppressed nationalities ghetto-ized into sanford st &amp; the US urban
&gt; &gt;centers,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Black Belt South &amp; Chicano SW &amp; Akwasasne Nations have the
&gt; &gt;right to
&gt; &gt; &gt; politically &amp; economically control those areas in which they are
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; plurality. to determine their relationship to the US, which they
&gt; &gt;have never
&gt; &gt; &gt; done. thru, at minimum, a national plebiscite of all Black peoples
&gt; &gt;in US.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Alright.  So you're talking about political control at the grassroots
&gt; &gt;level.  I can agree with that too.  But on the basis of *race*?  Why?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Do you extend this right to all local groups that identify themselves
&gt; &gt;as a "nation"?  Let's say the dingbats (to use your brother's word)
&gt; &gt;out in Kansas who voted to have Jesus in the classroom want to form
&gt; &gt;their own nation out there and do hell only knows what.  Should they
&gt; &gt;be allowed to?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Historically speaking, the move toward that kind of local government
&gt; &gt;(returning rights to the states, to municipalities, what have you)
&gt; &gt;has always been more regressive than progressive.  Say what you will
&gt; &gt;about the United States federal government, but at least they
&gt; &gt;enforced desegregation in schools in the south.  More than what the
&gt; &gt;state governments would have done.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For that matter, why do you want to divide the working class along
&gt; &gt;race and "cultural" lines.  The idea that a certain people are unique
&gt; &gt;based strictly upon their connection to some kind of cultural
&gt; &gt;heritage or land, something that that *outsiders* cannot understand,
&gt; &gt;sounds a lot of like fascism.  The cultural identity garbage is what
&gt; &gt;every totalitarian dictator from Mussollini to Idi Amin spouts before
&gt; &gt;sending people to the camps.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Look.  Are you a Marxist, or are you a communitarian?  Let's be real.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; you should develop a community consciousness at sanford st &amp; demand
&gt; &gt; &gt; community self-determination against j&amp;j dictatorship, which is the
&gt; &gt;heart of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the demand "community control". not "work with j&amp;j to solve
&gt; &gt;problems".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;J&amp;J will just go somewhere else, then.  They'll go to a community
&gt; &gt;where people don't have power, and they'll exploit there.  Or better
&gt; &gt;yet, they'll just leave the country.  What good is your self-
&gt; &gt;determination, then?  That's why you need to have an international
&gt; &gt;movement that unites the working class across all lines.  Class
&gt; &gt;alignment has to be first.  Once we defeat imperialism, then we can
&gt; &gt;talk about all the nice culture stuff.  Until then, we need something
&gt; &gt;concrete to unite on, and that is the mutual interest of the
&gt; &gt;proletariat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; you must recognize the overthrow of Reconstruction by fascist
&gt; &gt;terror. the
&gt; &gt; &gt; "modernist" industrialist sell-out of the 1876 hayes-tilden
&gt; &gt;scheme.  where
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the 40acres &amp; mule?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Yep.  Overthrow of reconstruction was none other than the return of
&gt; &gt;power to the states.  Putting power in the hands of the southern
&gt; &gt;cracker who is about as modern flint knife.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Face it.  If the United States government had enforced Reconstruction
&gt; &gt;by allowing the slaves to be armed and backed by the U.S. army, that
&gt; &gt;would have afforded them real local control and self-determination.
&gt; &gt;Instead they passed it off for the states to decide who could have
&gt; &gt;guns, who could run for state legislature, etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;How the hell are you going to enforce democracy if you don't
&gt; &gt;institutionalize it and back it up with some kind of federal force?
&gt; &gt;What good is freedom if people can decide to throw it away because it
&gt; &gt;does not blend well with their "cultural" conception?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Screw that.  We have to move forward, not back.  The line is drawn
&gt; &gt;between the people who produce value, and those to reap the harvest.
&gt; &gt;Not between black or white or geographical location.  Progress
&gt; &gt;requires an ideological and political unity of the part of human-kind
&gt; &gt;that embodies the potential for freedom, and that is the
&gt; &gt;proletariat.  Period.  If you want real democracy and real political
&gt; &gt;freedom, concretely, that's how you go about it.  You forget about
&gt; &gt;the "religious" differences.  Save religion for history class about
&gt; &gt;the middle ages.  Forget about color differences, because the idea
&gt; &gt;that people are different based upon "race" is exactly the idea we
&gt; &gt;want to get rid of.  It is, as you would say, part of the
&gt; &gt;superstructure.  And forget about the feeling of being a part of
&gt; &gt;the "land", like you're a German peasant or something.  Because you
&gt; &gt;better have a way of uniting the "black nation" once redevelopment
&gt; &gt;and revitalization pushes them out of the cities into enclaves in the
&gt; &gt;suburbs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;We have to find more reasons to unite and attack the power of the
&gt; &gt;bourgeoisie together.  How do you propose to do that by balkanizing
&gt; &gt;the United States?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Black America thoroughly meets the definition of nation: common
&gt; &gt;geographic
&gt; &gt; &gt; area, culture, history, developed economy, as put forward first by
&gt; &gt;Joe
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stalin, the great defender of oppressed nations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Oh irony.  You know, it always kills me when I think about how Joe
&gt; &gt;Stalin wrote that paper on national self-determination for Lenin, and
&gt; &gt;how he went and created an imperialist empire of satellites after the
&gt; &gt;war.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; self-determination &amp; reparations for women against patriarchy!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; self-determination &amp; reparations for workers against capital!
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Self-determination is a basic democratic right?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;So if I want to break off and form a country out of Sandford St.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;here, that's ok?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Make it more clear to me what you mean by self-determination.  I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not following.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I'm down with basic democratic rights.  Hell, I'm down with radical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;democratic rights, nevermind the basic ones.  But where do you get

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As a member of the New Brunswick People's Campaign, I am not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;convinced
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of the benefit of reparations for slavery.  That is, I have not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;heard
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a convincing argument in favor of it, and the only arguments I
&gt; &gt;can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;think of in favor of it can be beaten by arguments against it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The New Brunswick People's Campaign never voted on a statement
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reparations or national self-determination.  If the debate came
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;up, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would be against both of those lines.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As an advocate of concrete political radicalism, I cannot
&gt; &gt;condone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;national self-determination, especially not for the "black
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nation."  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reject this thesis, and if the Campaign endorsed self-
&gt; &gt;determination
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for the black nation, I would engage in heated debate over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;issue.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;In no case do I expect the New Brunswick People's Campaign or
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;members in it to share all of my opinions.  Since we have
&gt; &gt;never had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the discussion in any public meeting, why do you think it
&gt; &gt;belongs
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;press statement on police brutality, something we are against
&gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;theory and practice?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Campaign,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a broad-based coalition of New Brunswick residents and
&gt; &gt;their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;supporters, which includes local residents from all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nationalities
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;socioeconomic groups, issued the following statement today:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   The New Brunswick People's Campaign (NBPC) warmly
&gt; &gt;welcomes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the news that the Judiciary Committee of the New Jersey
&gt; &gt;State
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Senate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is calling for the resignation of Supreme Court Justice
&gt; &gt;Peter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Verniero.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Any police officer who engages in racial profiling and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;brutality against and mistreatment of people of color,
&gt; &gt;commits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;crime.  Such hate crimes must be addressed by swift and
&gt; &gt;severe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;punishment of those who commit them and their superiors who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;turn a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;blind eye to such acts.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   The removal of Justice Verniero would be consistent
&gt; &gt;with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;those principles.  Testimony before the Senate Judiciary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Committee
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;has amply demonstrated, to the NBPC's satisfaction, that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Justice
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Verniero had actual knowledge of racial profiling in the
&gt; &gt;state
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;police
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and that he failed to take steps to stop this hateful
&gt; &gt;practice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   The New Brunswick People's Campaign further calls
&gt; &gt;upon the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;New Brunswick City Council to pass a resolution calling for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Justice
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Verniero's resignation, just as the bipartisan group of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;senators
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the Senate Judiciary Committee have done.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   In light of the facts that have, at long last, been
&gt; &gt;revealed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to the public through the Senate Judiciary Committee's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hearings,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;need for community control over police is now more acute
&gt; &gt;than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ever.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;NBPC supports community control over police, and believes
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;community control, including democratically elected
&gt; &gt;civilian
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;police
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;review boards, will help bring a swift end to the hate
&gt; &gt;crimes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;racial profiling and mistreatment of people of color.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   The minority caucus of the State Legislature is
&gt; &gt;already
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;advancing such proposals.  We urge all legislators, if
&gt; &gt;they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;conscience, to support these efforts.

Perhaps I have not been as clear as I could be. As you know I stated
after
the elections in November That we made mistakes. I certainly do not
exclude
myself from those mistakes. I was a member of the streering committe and
the
People's Campaign's candidate.
I do think that it was a mistake to expel Bloc on Lock from the
campaign. I
think that we behaved towards them in the same fashion that they behaved

towards Curtis. Their attacks on Curtis should have been criticized
without
breaking the unity.
I do not think that Curtis's statement to the Home News was a big deal.
I
think that it could have been raised to him that we are fighting the
city
machine and that we need to break it, I think that we could have
discussed
the position of the campaign towards J&amp;J and used his remarks to the
press
to bring more clarity to that issue instead of just attacking Curtis for
his
statemnets. I think that expelling Block on lock was a short term
expedient
answer that dodged struggle rather than facing it head on.
     In terms of the recent discussion I was spreaking of expulsions in
refernce to the decesion to remove bloc on lock from the campaign list
serve. I was at the meeting with you and I clearly remember And I hope
it is
on video for posterity that the discussion to create an new list was
motivated by one desire and only one desire: to expel block on lock. I
am
very confused about it being spun in any other way.
    In terms of a general trend towads expulsions rather than struggle
for
unity, I am speaking about the history of the movemnt in New Brusnwick,
which has been quick to expel and quick to dismiss people who have
decide to
make a contribution in some other fashion or in some other city as if
New
Brunswick were the one and only city in which revolutuionary struggle is

taking place. (Although, at the same time I don't see anything
revolutionary
about being a dentist or herbalist or Ben &amp; Jerry)
   Cliff was expeled from NJFO because of his political line which,
while
it had an ultra-left tendency, also led the struggle against the
formulation
of "Maoism" and "the boycott the '96 election, both are worse line" of
Arthur Henson (which was eagerly taken up by everyone else in that
organization). The given reasons for Cliff's expulsion was (as X
admitted at
the last NJFO meeting) just a pretext.

The tendency to split or expel origniated with Arthur Henson who upon
being
criticized unceremoniously split from U&amp;S. ( as AB put it ran home and
took
his ball with him). X did the same thing when Baraka criticized him.

I am not denying that Bloc on Lock make it very difficult to with them
since
any person you organize can may be attcked as an imperialist agent if
they
do not emrge into the movement fully armed with Block on Locks'
interpretation of Marxism. Nonetheless, I don't think expulsions are
productive. Lenin and Trotsky were in the same Party and Lenin wrote an
article entitled "Judas Trotsky and the Trade Unions". We must struggle
for
unity not splits.

I also think taht it was a mistake to assist Frank Bright's political
aspirations. There is no problem with him being an activist in the
campaign
but in my opinion he had way to much influence over the political line
and
direction of the campaign. This was my mistake as much as anyone else's,
I
think that it was a right error. It was done with only the short term in

mind.

As to the debate over an office/"Center of Democarcy" I attached a copy
of a
simialr project that I worked on two years ago. It was a debacle that I
have
no interest in repeating. I have made many mistakes but I try my best
not to
repeat them.
I don't know if you have seen it before but it might be interesting,
perhaps
a similar budget is being drawn up now. I also have the "Break Even
Anaylsis" if anyone is interested. First time tragedy second time farce
as
they say.

keith,

though i don't agree with your analysis on the direction of the campaign
and
the majority in njfo (missionary work, etc.) I respect your position.
the
difference in positions will work itself out in practice, as we all
know. i
do have a question though:
were you not in the leadership of the campaign around one year ago when
the
decision was made to expel BoL? did you not agree/advocate that position
at
the time based on their actions against the campaign as a whole? have
you
changed your mind and do you now think that was a bad decision? i am
increasingly perplexed with you and matt's use of "expulsion" as a major

trend of the "right-wing" leadership, when both of you were
involved/agreed
to those decisions at the time (thus making you both "right wing" as
well,
no?). It appears that you are taking things out of context, which is to
say
that BoL didn't get kicked out last week.

<pre>Joe,
I misread your e-mail. You didn't make any connection to Shundler.

But like you said the odds of Frank oppossing Shundler are 100 to 1. So he won't join;
so  we don't need to exclude him. That's my point.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Joe,
&gt; &gt;If you think that the People's campaign registratiuon of any republicans in
&gt; &gt;New Brunswick had an effect on Shundler's victory.  I think that you are
&gt; &gt;mistaken.
&gt; &gt;There are many reasons that Shundler won but your argument is mystical. I
&gt; &gt;have already fought to unite evryone in the People's Camapign and will
&gt; &gt;continue to do so, but it has nothing to do with registering as a
&gt; &gt;repoublican. I don't agree with purging anyone at the moment from the
&gt; &gt;People's Campaign. I think that the People's Campaign must put the defeat
&gt; &gt;of Shundler on the top of its agends immediately or be a useless
&gt; &gt;organization. If anyone doesn't like that, they can leave but I won't purge
&gt; &gt;them or advocate that they be purged.  If Frank wants to work for
&gt; &gt;Shundler's defeat I will work with him, if he doesn't, I
&gt; &gt;won't.
&gt; &gt;      My line is principles of unity and work towards a democartic program
&gt; &gt;as the basis of unity. No one is purged or expelled who agrees with the
&gt; &gt;principles and the program. To join or not to join is on them.
&gt; &gt;      Purges are for a revolutionary organization not a mass based united
&gt; &gt;front. The line of purging from mass organizations is fallacious; it is the
&gt; &gt;same line that was upheld by the steering committeee of the People's
&gt; &gt;Camapign. Joe only disagrees with who got purged but the line is wrong in
&gt; &gt;form and content.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; i am referring in my arguement with tom to the fact that the republican

Subject:Re: [nbpc] Et tu, Curtis?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>To respond to Cliff's comments

&gt; "what is "unfortunate" about curtis' "confession"?  it is like fresh air."

I agree. Curtis explaining his position brings clarity, I think Matt's meaning is that
it is unfortunate that Curtis is loyal to the Republicans

&gt; "while yr "exploring", you might "explore" yr own responsibility for curtis'
&gt; republican betrayal.  he comes from yr organization, the CAPB, from which
&gt; you (henson-style) embraced the right &amp; expelled working class activists &amp;
&gt; revolutionaries.  where is the CAPB now?"

I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear ideological leadership
and bad political line which came to head in the People's Campaign with support for
bright and suppression of an anti-republican political line and a lack of any
revolutionary polirtical line.

&gt; "you might also "explore" how not only did yr NBPC not only "not put out
&gt; warnings of the republican danger", but encouraged curtis to be republican,
&gt; created a "communist" "ideology" to support it, &amp; in fact yrselves embraced
&gt; republican partying"

This is true enough although it has already been criticized on numerous occassions

&gt; "recognize that curtis does not proclaim to "reform" the republican party,
&gt; rather to "reform" its "image"--that is to find more liberal marks like
&gt; yrself to con."

That is how Curtis stated his case and that certainly seems to be in line with the
compassionate conservativism strategy of Shundler/Bush and even the most extreme right
wing section of the Buchanan reform party who even nominated Foster as their VP an
afro-american woman. (although that shopuld also tell us something about the
limitations of "woman" based ideology (ie."sisterhood" as well as black nationalism)

&gt; ""finally", why shd it take my remarks to make you "serious about being
&gt; self-reliant" (which you apparently aren't, judging from the absence of the
&gt; paper)?"

We don't want to exploit anyone. yr "remarks" made it clear to me that you feel that
the relationship we had as to production of the paper was "exploitative"

&gt; "as far as the definitive relationship between U&amp;S &amp; SWORD" we stand ready
&gt; to produce the paper as a collective organizer &amp; struggle through our
&gt; differences.  as you apparently are uninterested in our involvement (&amp; even,
&gt; apparently, in yr own production!), you shd, openly &amp; above board, state yr
&gt; reasons for sectarian sabotage of the paper."
&gt;

We have numerous ideological differences which in my opinion make joint editorial work
impossible at the moment. (not to mention differences of style. I have a hard time
trusting anyone who doesn't believe in friendship for instance and also a hard time
working with people who do not believe in trust itself.  Those are ultra-ultra left
lines which really resolve as the essence of right-wing ideology see Mussolini, G.
Gordon Liddy, the SA in Nazi Germany for examples).  Joint editorial work is
impossible given our differences as we learned in practice. That is we don't agree on
fundamental issues (in particular reparations (and as a sub heading the inability to
be self-critical) and the woman question and  the idea of an organiztaion whose
ideology is sisterhood is not marxist, it is feminist)  and we wasted mor than one
entire edit board meetings debating these points. To let that continue would have been
the actual sabatage. We discussed working together on production and in fact the last
newspaper SWORD printed/photocopied. Since then  you have made it clear that anything
short of joint work on the edit board constitutes an exploititive relationship. Since
we are not interetsed in knowingly exoploiting anyone nor are we interested in having
an edit board of multifarious trends our current relationship or lack of one is on
you.

As to the continued accusation of sabatage, it is something of a joke. Joe Smith
official spokesman of the oppressed first raised this accusation in his essay "Let the
oppressed speak".  His charge is that Matt did not send HIM articles to lay out
therefore the newspaper is being sabotaged. This is the same muddled super subjective
logic as the title of his piece suggests. Joe has blown up his own subjectyivty to the
point that he belives that his subjectivity is  objectivity (see also above "working
class activists" expelled from Coalition. actually Cliff was expelled and numerous
working calss activist remained in the organization but Cliff believes that not only
does he represent the working calss but that he is the working class)

Looking at the political line of SWORD especially around the issue of the paper and
its production we are actually seeing the ultra-left version of the "office space
community center club house" line. That is placing production and the productive
forces above politics. Joe nor Cliff is concerned with the political line of the

Joe wrote an article, that has been endlessly defended, that stated white workers need
reparations along with afro-americans. I am not interested in putting out that
political line. Nor am I interested in putting out political lines endorsing
"sisterhood".  Politics must lead production not the other way around. Production
before politics is the theory of sponatinety and the essence of economism (see "What
is To be done")

If SWORD wants to help put out the political line of the U&amp;S editorial board than
let's go, but if they insist on being a part of the edit board then first we must come
to ideological resolutions. From what has already been sd SWORD believes that helping
with production is exploitation. We certainly do not intend to exploit anyones

<pre>Joe,
you wrote:

&gt; "that is the headline the targum gave the essay (when i e-mailed it to myself
&gt; the title became such) which was written in response to david horowitz's 10
&gt; reasons why reparations for blacks is wrong... you were at rutger's last
&gt; semester weren't you? didn't catch your position, where is it? do you agree
&gt; that your boss should rob you?"

I'm not sure exactly what your saying, but as to my boss robbing me or any boss
robbing anyone,  that it is not the issue of reparations. You are confusing two
distinct things. Reparations for afro-americacans are repeartions for chattel slavery.
Reparations is one of the ways to create equality among the multi-national working
calss so that unity is easier to achieve. If white workers throughout the U&amp;S got
repartions along with afro-american workers then the relationship would not change.You
are making the demand for reparations a demand for socialism.

&gt; "i don't see any working class people in the capb, how is it that u do?"

When the coalition existed it was primarily a working class organization. If you are
gloating about its demise I don't know what to tell you.

&gt; "you are off the wall to explain your arguements from such basis."

I don't know what that sentence is refering to.

&gt; you say:
&gt; "Politics must lead production not the other way around."

That's my line, I don't think that you answered it.

&gt; the differences in our ideologies are on the table, what else needs to be
&gt; done to put forward the newspaper collectively? the concept of u&amp;s is to
&gt; unite revolutionaries, and to win the advanced to communism! not to sit in
&gt; meetings until we all agree with your IDEAS, because we both know your
&gt; practice is out to lunch...

I raised the question of putting froward the paper collectively very specificly in the
piece to whihc you responded.
the issue is:
1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board is one trend.
2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.

As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working relationship that you
feel is non-exploitative.

I don't think that we both know my "practice is out to lunch". If this were the case
than why would you be so eager to unite with it?

&gt; keith, the fact is i have seen you expell and disassociate yourself from
&gt; more revolutionary/working class people than i've seen you organize. if i
&gt; didn't call amiri and set up a meeting, which you and matt had cancelled, i
&gt; don't see reason that there would be any production going on at all.

Actaully I don't think that you know much about my practice.

 We re-scheduled the meeting because Baraka was not going to be in town on the
original date and you came to that meeting
.
I especially like the super subjective grandiose vision of yrself.  " i don't see
reason that there would be any production going on at all."  Are you also actaully the
emobiement of Reason that travels throughout history on whose behalf all people are
acting?

&gt; the reason the same criticism is coming forward about the republicans in the
&gt; peoples' campaign is because the situation has not been rectified. nor have
&gt; you offered anything more than a mere admittance to things impossible to
&gt; deny about your affiliation with such alliances with republicans. what is
&gt; your plan keith to rectify the situation, because as it is dim is on the
&gt; housing authority - that is your bag.

You can make the criticism untill the cows come home. Your proposal for rectification
is to expel the republicans and re-admit you.
I already sd that I agree republicans should be expelled from the organization and
that SWORD should be united with in the People's Campaign.But I think that it is more
important that the majority of people involved with the camapign understand what is
happening and what mistakes were made, otherwise they will just be repeated (maybe
with an ultra-left cover).



&gt; you say:
&gt; "I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear ideological
&gt; leadership and bad political line which came to head in the People's
&gt; Campaign with support for bright and suppression of an anti-republican
&gt; political line and a lack of any revolutionary polirtical line."

&gt; but what are you going to do?

I think that you are just repeating yrself here, but again maybe I'm blinded by
ignorance if so please cast the light. Otherwise see my reply above.

&gt; who is going to lead the vote to announce all republicans must be removed
&gt; and are not welcome in the New Brunswick Peoples' Campaign because in fact
&gt; the racist republicans party is the most vicous opposition to the peoples
&gt; productive development?

I think that this is the same again.
But I do have a question. What is "the peoples productive development"?

I tried to answer the isues you raise, but since this reply is a little lengthy, I
would reiterate this point as being central:

1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board is a single
trend.
2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.

As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working relationship that you
feel is non-exploitative. First, editorial unity is not possible until there is a
change in political line.Secondly,  if the current relationship is termed
"exploitative" then it must change. There's the problem. I have made more than one
proposal for its solution. As far as I am concerned its on you.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;To respond to Cliff's comments
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "what is "unfortunate" about curtis' "confession"?  it is like fresh
&gt; &gt;air."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I agree. Curtis explaining his position brings clarity, I think Matt's
&gt; &gt;meaning is that
&gt; &gt;it is unfortunate that Curtis is loyal to the Republicans
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "while yr "exploring", you might "explore" yr own responsibility for
&gt; &gt;curtis'
&gt; &gt; &gt; republican betrayal.  he comes from yr organization, the CAPB, from
&gt; &gt;which
&gt; &gt; &gt; you (henson-style) embraced the right &amp; expelled working class activists
&gt; &gt;&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; revolutionaries.  where is the CAPB now?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear ideological
&gt; &gt;leadership
&gt; &gt;and bad political line which came to head in the People's Campaign with
&gt; &gt;support for
&gt; &gt;bright and suppression of an anti-republican political line and a lack of
&gt; &gt;any
&gt; &gt;revolutionary polirtical line.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "you might also "explore" how not only did yr NBPC not only "not put out
&gt; &gt; &gt; warnings of the republican danger", but encouraged curtis to be
&gt; &gt;republican,
&gt; &gt; &gt; created a "communist" "ideology" to support it, &amp; in fact yrselves
&gt; &gt;embraced
&gt; &gt; &gt; republican partying"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is true enough although it has already been criticized on numerous
&gt; &gt;occassions
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "recognize that curtis does not proclaim to "reform" the republican
&gt; &gt;party,
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather to "reform" its "image"--that is to find more liberal marks like
&gt; &gt; &gt; yrself to con."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That is how Curtis stated his case and that certainly seems to be in line
&gt; &gt;with the
&gt; &gt;compassionate conservativism strategy of Shundler/Bush and even the most
&gt; &gt;extreme right
&gt; &gt;wing section of the Buchanan reform party who even nominated Foster as
&gt; &gt;their VP an
&gt; &gt;afro-american woman. (although that shopuld also tell us something about
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;limitations of "woman" based ideology (ie."sisterhood" as well as black
&gt; &gt;nationalism)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ""finally", why shd it take my remarks to make you "serious about being
&gt; &gt; &gt; self-reliant" (which you apparently aren't, judging from the absence of
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; paper)?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;We don't want to exploit anyone. yr "remarks" made it clear to me that you
&gt; &gt;feel that
&gt; &gt;the relationship we had as to production of the paper was "exploitative"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "as far as the definitive relationship between U&amp;S &amp; SWORD" we stand
&gt; &gt;ready
&gt; &gt; &gt; to produce the paper as a collective organizer &amp; struggle through our
&gt; &gt; &gt; differences.  as you apparently are uninterested in our involvement (&amp;
&gt; &gt;even,
&gt; &gt; &gt; apparently, in yr own production!), you shd, openly &amp; above board, state
&gt; &gt;yr
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasons for sectarian sabotage of the paper."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;We have numerous ideological differences which in my opinion make joint
&gt; &gt;editorial work
&gt; &gt;impossible at the moment. (not to mention differences of style. I have a
&gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt;trusting anyone who doesn't believe in friendship for instance and also a
&gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt;working with people who do not believe in trust itself.  Those are
&gt; &gt;ultra-ultra left
&gt; &gt;lines which really resolve as the essence of right-wing ideology see
&gt; &gt;Mussolini, G.
&gt; &gt;Gordon Liddy, the SA in Nazi Germany for examples).  Joint editorial work
&gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt;impossible given our differences as we learned in practice. That is we
&gt; &gt;don't agree on
&gt; &gt;fundamental issues (in particular reparations (and as a sub heading the
&gt; &gt;inability to
&gt; &gt;be self-critical) and the woman question and  the idea of an organiztaion
&gt; &gt;whose
&gt; &gt;ideology is sisterhood is not marxist, it is feminist)  and we wasted mor
&gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt;entire edit board meetings debating these points. To let that continue
&gt; &gt;would have been
&gt; &gt;the actual sabatage. We discussed working together on production and in
&gt; &gt;fact the last
&gt; &gt;newspaper SWORD printed/photocopied. Since then  you have made it clear
&gt; &gt;that anything
&gt; &gt;short of joint work on the edit board constitutes an exploititive
&gt; &gt;relationship. Since
&gt; &gt;we are not interetsed in knowingly exoploiting anyone nor are we interested
&gt; &gt;in having
&gt; &gt;an edit board of multifarious trends our current relationship or lack of
&gt; &gt;one is on
&gt; &gt;you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As to the continued accusation of sabatage, it is something of a joke. Joe
&gt; &gt;Smith
&gt; &gt;official spokesman of the oppressed first raised this accusation in his
&gt; &gt;essay "Let the
&gt; &gt;oppressed speak".  His charge is that Matt did not send HIM articles to lay
&gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt;therefore the newspaper is being sabotaged. This is the same muddled super
&gt; &gt;subjective
&gt; &gt;logic as the title of his piece suggests. Joe has blown up his own
&gt; &gt;subjectyivty to the
&gt; &gt;point that he belives that his subjectivity is  objectivity (see also above
&gt; &gt;"working
&gt; &gt;class activists" expelled from Coalition. actually Cliff was expelled and
&gt; &gt;numerous
&gt; &gt;working calss activist remained in the organization but Cliff believes that
&gt; &gt;not only
&gt; &gt;does he represent the working calss but that he is the working class)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Looking at the political line of SWORD especially around the issue of the
&gt; &gt;paper and
&gt; &gt;its production we are actually seeing the ultra-left version of the "office
&gt; &gt;space
&gt; &gt;community center club house" line. That is placing production and the
&gt; &gt;productive
&gt; &gt;forces above politics. Joe nor Cliff is concerned with the political line
&gt; &gt;of the
&gt; &gt;newspaper just "come out with it" "where is it" "hurry up" new and improved
&gt; &gt;revolutionary newsaper faster stronger better than before.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Joe wrote an article, that has been endlessly defended, that stated white
&gt; &gt;workers need
&gt; &gt;reparations along with afro-americans. I am not interested in putting out
&gt; &gt;that

You are making strong allegations.  You should at least try to substantiate them.
Otherwise you are manure for cointelpro.

You claimed that a number of people myself included have sabotaged U&amp;S for numerous
years. That is a outright lie, but if you are going to say it at least try to put
forward some evidence to back up your claim. Otherwise as I sd you are the manure of
cointelpro. which doesn't mean you are a part of it but its fertilizer.
As far as distrobution of the paper goes, I don't know what your last comment means,
so know I don't comprende.
please elaborate.

<pre>Joe,
yr slogan "Reperations for the multi-national working class!!" is trotskyism.
U&amp;S put forward and has been struggling for reperations for slavery for the
afro-american nation. Your slogan liquidates the demand and operates under the
unstated assumption that equality has already been achieved among the multi-natuional
working class- that's trotskyism. The slogan is militant reformism. It makes no
distinction between the minimum and maximum program but actually collapses the two.
Maybe yr rrrrrrevolutionary practice should include studying marxism-leninism.

&gt; &gt;Joe,
&gt; &gt;you wrote:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "that is the headline the targum gave the essay (when i e-mailed it to
&gt; &gt;myself
&gt; &gt; &gt; the title became such) which was written in response to david horowitz's
&gt; &gt;10
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasons why reparations for blacks is wrong... you were at rutger's last
&gt; &gt; &gt; semester weren't you? didn't catch your position, where is it? do you
&gt; &gt;agree
&gt; &gt; &gt; that your boss should rob you?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm not sure exactly what your saying, but as to my boss robbing me or any
&gt; &gt;boss
&gt; &gt;robbing anyone,  that it is not the issue of reparations. You are confusing
&gt; &gt;two
&gt; &gt;distinct things. Reparations for afro-americacans are repeartions for
&gt; &gt;chattel slavery.
&gt; &gt;Reparations is one of the ways to create equality among the multi-national
&gt; &gt;working
&gt; &gt;calss so that unity is easier to achieve. If white workers throughout the
&gt; &gt;U&amp;S got
&gt; &gt;repartions along with afro-american workers then the relationship would not
&gt; &gt;change.You
&gt; &gt;are making the demand for reparations a demand for socialism.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "i don't see any working class people in the capb, how is it that u do?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;When the coalition existed it was primarily a working class organization.
&gt; &gt;If you are
&gt; &gt;gloating about its demise I don't know what to tell you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "you are off the wall to explain your arguements from such basis."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't know what that sentence is refering to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Politics must lead production not the other way around."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That's my line, I don't think that you answered it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the differences in our ideologies are on the table, what else needs to
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; done to put forward the newspaper collectively? the concept of u&amp;s is to
&gt; &gt; &gt; unite revolutionaries, and to win the advanced to communism! not to sit
&gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; meetings until we all agree with your IDEAS, because we both know your
&gt; &gt; &gt; practice is out to lunch...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I raised the question of putting froward the paper collectively very
&gt; &gt;specificly in the
&gt; &gt;piece to whihc you responded.
&gt; &gt;the issue is:
&gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board is
&gt; &gt;one trend.
&gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working relationship
&gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't think that we both know my "practice is out to lunch". If this were
&gt; &gt;the case
&gt; &gt;than why would you be so eager to unite with it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; keith, the fact is i have seen you expell and disassociate yourself from
&gt; &gt; &gt; more revolutionary/working class people than i've seen you organize. if
&gt; &gt;i
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn't call amiri and set up a meeting, which you and matt had
&gt; &gt;cancelled, i
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't see reason that there would be any production going on at all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Actaully I don't think that you know much about my practice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  We re-scheduled the meeting because Baraka was not going to be in town on
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;original date and you came to that meeting
&gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt;I especially like the super subjective grandiose vision of yrself.  " i
&gt; &gt;don't see
&gt; &gt;reason that there would be any production going on at all."  Are you also
&gt; &gt;actaully the
&gt; &gt;emobiement of Reason that travels throughout history on whose behalf all
&gt; &gt;people are
&gt; &gt;acting?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the reason the same criticism is coming forward about the republicans in
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; peoples' campaign is because the situation has not been rectified. nor
&gt; &gt;have
&gt; &gt; &gt; you offered anything more than a mere admittance to things impossible to
&gt; &gt; &gt; deny about your affiliation with such alliances with republicans. what
&gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; your plan keith to rectify the situation, because as it is dim is on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; housing authority - that is your bag.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You can make the criticism untill the cows come home. Your proposal for
&gt; &gt;rectification
&gt; &gt;is to expel the republicans and re-admit you.
&gt; &gt;I already sd that I agree republicans should be expelled from the
&gt; &gt;organization and
&gt; &gt;that SWORD should be united with in the People's Campaign.But I think that
&gt; &gt;it is more
&gt; &gt;important that the majority of people involved with the camapign understand
&gt; &gt;what is
&gt; &gt;happening and what mistakes were made, otherwise they will just be repeated
&gt; &gt;(maybe
&gt; &gt;with an ultra-left cover).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; "I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear
&gt; &gt;ideological
&gt; &gt; &gt; leadership and bad political line which came to head in the People's
&gt; &gt; &gt; Campaign with support for bright and suppression of an anti-republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; political line and a lack of any revolutionary polirtical line."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; but what are you going to do?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think that you are just repeating yrself here, but again maybe I'm
&gt; &gt;blinded by
&gt; &gt;ignorance if so please cast the light. Otherwise see my reply above.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; who is going to lead the vote to announce all republicans must be
&gt; &gt;removed
&gt; &gt; &gt; and are not welcome in the New Brunswick Peoples' Campaign because in
&gt; &gt;fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; the racist republicans party is the most vicous opposition to the
&gt; &gt;peoples
&gt; &gt; &gt; productive development?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think that this is the same again.
&gt; &gt;But I do have a question. What is "the peoples productive development"?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I tried to answer the isues you raise, but since this reply is a little
&gt; &gt;lengthy, I
&gt; &gt;would reiterate this point as being central:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board is a
&gt; &gt;single
&gt; &gt;trend.
&gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working relationship
&gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative. First, editorial unity is not possible until
&gt; &gt;there is a
&gt; &gt;change in political line.Secondly,  if the current relationship is termed
&gt; &gt;"exploitative" then it must change. There's the problem. I have made more
&gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt;proposal for its solution. As far as I am concerned its on you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; republican partying"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This is true enough although it has already been criticized on numerous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;occassions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "recognize that curtis does not proclaim to "reform" the republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;party,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather to "reform" its "image"--that is to find more liberal marks
&gt; &gt;like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yrself to con."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That is how Curtis stated his case and that certainly seems to be in
&gt; &gt;line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;compassionate conservativism strategy of Shundler/Bush and even the
&gt; &gt;most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;extreme right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wing section of the Buchanan reform party who even nominated Foster as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their VP an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;afro-american woman. (although that shopuld also tell us something
&gt; &gt;about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;limitations of "woman" based ideology (ie."sisterhood" as well as black
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nationalism)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ""finally", why shd it take my remarks to make you "serious about
&gt; &gt;being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-reliant" (which you apparently aren't, judging from the absence
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paper)?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We don't want to exploit anyone. yr "remarks" made it clear to me that
&gt; &gt;you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feel that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the relationship we had as to production of the paper was
&gt; &gt;"exploitative"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "as far as the definitive relationship between U&amp;S &amp; SWORD" we stand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ready
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to produce the paper as a collective organizer &amp; struggle through
&gt; &gt;our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differences.  as you apparently are uninterested in our involvement
&gt; &gt;(&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;even,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apparently, in yr own production!), you shd, openly &amp; above board,
&gt; &gt;state
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;yr
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reasons for sectarian sabotage of the paper."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We have numerous ideological differences which in my opinion make joint
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;editorial work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible at the moment. (not to mention differences of style. I have
&gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;trusting anyone who doesn't believe in friendship for instance and also
&gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working with people who do not believe in trust itself.  Those are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ultra-ultra left
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lines which really resolve as the essence of right-wing ideology see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Mussolini, G.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Gordon Liddy, the SA in Nazi Germany for examples).  Joint editorial
&gt; &gt;work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible given our differences as we learned in practice. That is we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;don't agree on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fundamental issues (in particular reparations (and as a sub heading the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;inability to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be self-critical) and the woman question and  the idea of an
&gt; &gt;organiztaion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;whose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideology is sisterhood is not marxist, it is feminist)  and we wasted
&gt; &gt;mor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;entire edit board meetings debating these points. To let that continue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would have been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the actual sabatage. We discussed working together on production and in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fact the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;newspaper SWORD printed/photocopied. Since then  you have made it clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;short of joint work on the edit board constitutes an exploititive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship. Since
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we are not interetsed in knowingly exoploiting anyone nor are we
&gt; &gt;interested
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in having
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;an edit board of multifarious trends our current relationship or lack
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one is on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As to the continued accusation of sabatage, it is something of a joke.
&gt; &gt;Joe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Smith
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;official spokesman of the oppressed first raised this accusation in his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;essay "Let the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;oppressed speak".  His charge is that Matt did not send HIM articles to
&gt; &gt;lay
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;therefore the newspaper is being sabotaged. This is the same muddled
&gt; &gt;super
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;subjective
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;logic as the title of his piece suggests. Joe has blown up his own
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;subjectyivty to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;point that he belives that his subjectivity is  objectivity (see also
&gt; &gt;above
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"working

&gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;numerous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working calss activist remained in the organization but Cliff believes
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;does he represent the working calss but that he is the working class)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Looking at the political line of SWORD especially around the issue of
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;paper and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;its production we are actually seeing the ultra-left version of the
&gt; &gt;"office
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;space
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;community center club house" line. That is placing production and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;productive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;forces above politics. Joe nor Cliff is concerned with the political
&gt; &gt;line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;newspaper just "come out with it" "where is it" "hurry up" new and
&gt; &gt;improved
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;revolutionary newsaper faster stronger better than before.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe wrote an article, that has been endlessly defended, that stated
&gt; &gt;white
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;workers need
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reparations along with afro-americans. I am not interested in putting
&gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;political line. Nor am I interested in putting out political lines
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;endorsing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"sisterhood".  Politics must lead production not the other way around.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Production
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;before politics is the theory of sponatinety and the essence of
&gt; &gt;economism
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(see "What
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is To be done")
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If SWORD wants to help put out the political line of the U&amp;S editorial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;board than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;let's go, but if they insist on being a part of the edit board then
&gt; &gt;first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we must come
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to ideological resolutions. From what has already been sd SWORD
&gt; &gt;believes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that helping
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with production is exploitation. We certainly do not intend to exploit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;anyones
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resources.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "scientific socialists dismiss "luck".

&gt; &gt;or

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe- It seems Curtis' unfortunate "confession" makes your positions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about him &amp; mine wrong.  To the extent that this is so, I was wrong
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you lied about his past.  However, we will certainly continue
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;explore the role that BOL/SWORD played in pushing him back into the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican fold--as we will be struggling to win over many many
&gt; &gt;working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;class people from the Republican party. There was a time not too
&gt; &gt;long
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ago
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that we were reading DuBois &amp; Baraka's Black Nation together...As
&gt; &gt;we've
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;agreed the NBPC didn't put out warnings against Republican danger,
&gt; &gt;etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the one hand, but on the other I maintain that dogmatism, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Marxism-Leninism, caused BOL not to embrace his democratic
&gt; &gt;tendencies.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the extent that they still exist, they will obviously run
&gt; &gt;completely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;counter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to the objectives of the racist, imperialist,
&gt; &gt;not-about-to-be-reformed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican Party, hopefully causing distress.  (Curtis- I say this
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The less distress your embrace of the Republicans causes you, the
&gt; &gt;more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self interest has won over the interests of the people, even Sissy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Adams.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally, it was Cliff's statement that U&amp;S was exploiting your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resources
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;directly following our "unity meeting" that made us more serious
&gt; &gt;about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-reliant, an innevitable and necessary move. (CS:..."Though our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lay-out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and distribution resources are readily exploited.") As far as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;definitive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship that exists between U&amp;S &amp; SWORD, I would say talk to
&gt; &gt;AB,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;organize another sit down, do what you need to do.  Otherwise, good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;luck
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with the Union/housing battle.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Cliff,
I think there is some agreement on the points you raise, but I don't see where you
point forward a concrete solution.
you wrote:

&gt; "there are apparently several points of disagreement. &amp; i think some points
&gt; of agreement.  the question is how to move forward toward resolution through
&gt; disagreements. this is the function a newspaper shd  play in uniting
&gt; revolutionary circles toward a national organization of revolutionaries."

agreed

&gt; for instance, we have maintained consistent debate, discussion, &amp;tc., on
&gt; these message boards, i think productively, overall.  but these boards, &amp;
&gt; the dialogue are out of reach of the community.

agreed

&gt; these same exchanges, arguments, alliances... shd be in a form accessible to
&gt; the people--thru a newspaper.  these disagreements shd be brought to the
&gt; people, which is where they will be finally resolved.

agreed, we actually attempted to publish the essay that you wrote, but it is over 2000
words. which is 4 times the longest running article. I didn't think that it would be
fair to except it without yr input. If you could summarize yr position in under 500 or
break into a series of articles that we could publish and respond to we will put it
out in the next issue.


&gt; "we claim agreement to unite revolutionaries! win the advanced to communism!
&gt; end imperialism, &amp;tc.  if we disagree over "reparations", or "woman
&gt; question", we shd summarize our views and publish them, also summarize our
&gt; criticisms and suggestions toward resolution, as we promote also what we
&gt; agree on.  we are not afraid of open debate.  we are not afraid of different
&gt; ideas of what is revolutionary, &amp; let the best one win.  unless U&amp;S wants to
&gt; say that we are not revolutionary, &amp; then we can take that to the street.
&gt; but you cant say its on us as we are not afraid to work with you, rather..."

agreed, but this does not speak to how our relationship is going to work in practice.

&gt; "yr "politics not production" angle is disingenuous, if not dishonest.
&gt; what is political theory if not put to practice? what is an editorial staff
&gt; with no paper?  the question is not vacant production for its own sake, as
&gt; you imply, but production of peoples' organization, the
&gt; application/realization of revolutionary "politics".  otherwise there is no
&gt; "politics", except in the mind of self-appointed, lazy "leaders"."

I don't think that the question of politics over production is superficial,
disingenous or dishonest. Frist, we have been dealing with that line from the right
(former NJFO, People's Campaign) for many months. The answer is a simplistic
insistence on practice and a refusal to discuss what that practice is going to be, it
has resolved into anarchistic "everyone do what they want because we don't want o talk
about it or defend our veiws".  The situation between us is a little different, but
there has certianly been the same emphasis on "getting out a paper" from comrades on
yr end. The paper at the moment has at best a distrobution between 1-2 thousand. Its a
start and better than nothing. But I would rather it be delayed a month and have a
better political line and be a better paper than be rushed out. Henson was the hero of
production over politics We have stacks of paper that not only didn't get moved but
that suck and few would read if they did. The majority of artuicles are  badly written
are  boring and sloganeering, I am not interested in repeating that. On the other hand
I'm not saying taht production is not important or taht it doesn't need to move
forward. The paper will not get better by meeting about it but by getting it out, but
at the moment the principle thing is to consolidate its political line. (the paper
should be out by the monday or tues).


&gt; re: "reparations", i have asked a couple of times for a specific definition
&gt; from U&amp;S.  what exactly do you mean by the term?  how do you define it to
&gt; apply exclusively to question of national oppression, to the "reform" of
&gt; chattel slavery?  possibly i do not understand the word as you do...  to me
&gt; "reparations" is a general term to connote "amendment for wrongdoing" &amp; has
&gt; broad application, which is not to deny that some "application" to "amend"
&gt; certain "wrongdoing" is primary against others in the anti-imperialist
&gt; struggle, e.g. "reparation" to the black nation.  but how is the term
&gt; defined to apply to only one social relation?

I think we agree on the definition of reparations. The slogan we put forward doesn't
reduce the concept of reparations to one relation rather we are applying the general
conecpt to a particular relation. You seem to be saying because we uphold reparations
for chattel slavery we should uphold every conceivable demand for reparations. We may
have abbreviated our demand for reparations for cahttel slavery and stated simply
reparations, if that was unclear we no doubt can always make our selves clearer. But
our line is repartions for the afro-american nation.
Ras made the point at the meeting on June 20th that the reality of yr call for
reparations for women is reparations for men   as well at least to the extent that
they are married or co-habitat as in a family. That is if Lou were to get reperations
I would benifit as well. for instance.


&gt; "re: "woman question", how does U&amp;S consider classifying women as a "gender",
&gt; not a "sex", to be marxist, or even bourgeois biology?
&gt; where is U&amp;S' "marxist" program for women? as you are quick to knock
&gt; "sisterhood &amp; struggle", which promotes revolutionary democracy,
&gt; anti-imperialism, and marxism.  apparently you oppose women's organization
&gt; as such, tho you (occasionally) claim that women are oppressed.  how do you
&gt; explain this?"

at the moment we are developing a cohesive platform. Though U&amp;S has put forward on
more than one occassion that the primary struggle of women is for equal rights. That
is to have the full benifits of the bourgeois democratic stage of the revolution. The
socialization of housework etc. in my opinion is something that can be struggled for
now as well but that it will be a part of the transformation to socialism. In my
opinion the height of the women's movemnt was around the struggle for the ERA and it
has been narrowed to pro-choice. The is not to belittle the struggle for reproductive
rights but I would add that that struggle should include the right to have a healthy
child (pre-natal care, health care, child care etc).

I think that yr insistence on the term "sex" as oppossed to "gender" is
meta-physical.(the general accusation against U&amp;S is based on one article. And just to
remind at least those who remember of the pre-judice against U&amp;S on this question it
was believed that the sentence on gender oppression in Revolutionaries Unite.. was
added after its intial publication, though that was not true)  The opression of women
takes both forms. Sex oppression having to do with reproduction while it may be the
basis of gender oppression does not reduce to it.

I am not against sisterhood and struggle. I don't believe that it is marxism-leninsm,
I think that it is feminism. I'm not against NOW either.
But what is SWORD's position.

&gt; how does the existence of sold-out women eliminate the fact of women's
&gt; sexual oppression?  does the existence of clarence thomas mean there is no
&gt; black national oppression?  do you dismiss "black nia force" as
&gt; "anti-marxist" petty "limitations"?

I don't dismiss BNF, I don't think  they themselves claim Marxism-Leninism as their
ideology, though I know they are not "anti-marxist".  Sold out women doesn't eliminate
women's oppresion but it does eliminate "sisterhood".

&gt; but these arguments have significance &amp; shd be sorted out, openly, before &amp;
&gt; among the masses.  "freedom of association", that's yr prerogative.  but the
&gt; point is to organize. to neglect any productive contribution is to oppose
&gt; organization, which is to sabotage.  my boss is better able to organize
&gt; workers who "disagree" with, "distrust" and "dislike" each other than the
&gt; self-appointed "revolutionary" "leadership"  who claim "unity".

Actually, the workers who your boss organizes have no real choice. our unity is
voluntary.
You claimed that the relatuionship was exploitive. Exploitation is theft, now you are
claiming taht it is a "productive contribution".
You can't have it both ways, is it a contribution or is it exploitation?
What is the relationship that you would recommend?
I sd that it is our opinion that the diferences we have ideologically made joint work
on the edit board impossible. There must be substantial differences otherwise the
people already there could adequately represent yr political line.
To resolve those diffrences we suggested public forums and are agreeable to polemics
in the paper and even opn e-mail lists.
As to joint productive work it is on you still to define that relationship, since we
refuse to be in a relationship and than be accussed of exploiting anyone.

so as far as I am concerned the two issues that I raised intailly remain to be
answered, and I still think that it is on you.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;To respond to Cliff's comments
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "what is "unfortunate" about curtis' "confession"?  it is like fresh
&gt; &gt;air."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I agree. Curtis explaining his position brings clarity, I think Matt's
&gt; &gt;meaning is that
&gt; &gt;it is unfortunate that Curtis is loyal to the Republicans
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "while yr "exploring", you might "explore" yr own responsibility for
&gt; &gt;curtis'
&gt; &gt; &gt; republican betrayal.  he comes from yr organization, the CAPB, from
&gt; &gt;which
&gt; &gt; &gt; you (henson-style) embraced the right &amp; expelled working class activists
&gt; &gt;&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; revolutionaries.  where is the CAPB now?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear ideological
&gt; &gt;leadership
&gt; &gt;and bad political line which came to head in the People's Campaign with
&gt; &gt;support for
&gt; &gt;bright and suppression of an anti-republican political line and a lack of
&gt; &gt;any
&gt; &gt;revolutionary polirtical line.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "you might also "explore" how not only did yr NBPC not only "not put out
&gt; &gt; &gt; warnings of the republican danger", but encouraged curtis to be
&gt; &gt;republican,
&gt; &gt; &gt; created a "communist" "ideology" to support it, &amp; in fact yrselves
&gt; &gt;embraced
&gt; &gt; &gt; republican partying"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is true enough although it has already been criticized on numerous
&gt; &gt;occassions
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "recognize that curtis does not proclaim to "reform" the republican
&gt; &gt;party,
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather to "reform" its "image"--that is to find more liberal marks like
&gt; &gt; &gt; yrself to con."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That is how Curtis stated his case and that certainly seems to be in line
&gt; &gt;with the
&gt; &gt;compassionate conservativism strategy of Shundler/Bush and even the most
&gt; &gt;extreme right
&gt; &gt;wing section of the Buchanan reform party who even nominated Foster as
&gt; &gt;their VP an
&gt; &gt;afro-american woman. (although that shopuld also tell us something about
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;limitations of "woman" based ideology (ie."sisterhood" as well as black
&gt; &gt;nationalism)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ""finally", why shd it take my remarks to make you "serious about being
&gt; &gt; &gt; self-reliant" (which you apparently aren't, judging from the absence of
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; paper)?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;We don't want to exploit anyone. yr "remarks" made it clear to me that you
&gt; &gt;feel that
&gt; &gt;the relationship we had as to production of the paper was "exploitative"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "as far as the definitive relationship between U&amp;S &amp; SWORD" we stand
&gt; &gt;ready
&gt; &gt; &gt; to produce the paper as a collective organizer &amp; struggle through our
&gt; &gt; &gt; differences.  as you apparently are uninterested in our involvement (&amp;
&gt; &gt;even,
&gt; &gt; &gt; apparently, in yr own production!), you shd, openly &amp; above board, state
&gt; &gt;yr
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasons for sectarian sabotage of the paper."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;We have numerous ideological differences which in my opinion make joint
&gt; &gt;editorial work
&gt; &gt;impossible at the moment. (not to mention differences of style. I have a
&gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt;trusting anyone who doesn't believe in friendship for instance and also a
&gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt;working with people who do not believe in trust itself.  Those are
&gt; &gt;ultra-ultra left
&gt; &gt;lines which really resolve as the essence of right-wing ideology see
&gt; &gt;Mussolini, G.
&gt; &gt;Gordon Liddy, the SA in Nazi Germany for examples).  Joint editorial work
&gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt;impossible given our differences as we learned in practice. That is we
&gt; &gt;don't agree on
&gt; &gt;fundamental issues (in particular reparations (and as a sub heading the
&gt; &gt;inability to
&gt; &gt;be self-critical) and the woman question and  the idea of an organiztaion
&gt; &gt;whose
&gt; &gt;ideology is sisterhood is not marxist, it is feminist)  and we wasted mor
&gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt;entire edit board meetings debating these points. To let that continue
&gt; &gt;would have been
&gt; &gt;the actual sabatage. We discussed working together on production and in
&gt; &gt;fact the last
&gt; &gt;newspaper SWORD printed/photocopied. Since then  you have made it clear
&gt; &gt;that anything
&gt; &gt;short of joint work on the edit board constitutes an exploititive
&gt; &gt;relationship. Since
&gt; &gt;we are not interetsed in knowingly exoploiting anyone nor are we interested
&gt; &gt;in having
&gt; &gt;an edit board of multifarious trends our current relationship or lack of
&gt; &gt;one is on
&gt; &gt;you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As to the continued accusation of sabatage, it is something of a joke. Joe
&gt; &gt;Smith
&gt; &gt;official spokesman of the oppressed first raised this accusation in his
&gt; &gt;essay "Let the
&gt; &gt;oppressed speak".  His charge is that Matt did not send HIM articles to lay
&gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt;therefore the newspaper is being sabotaged. This is the same muddled super
&gt; &gt;subjective
&gt; &gt;logic as the title of his piece suggests. Joe has blown up his own
&gt; &gt;subjectyivty to the
&gt; &gt;point that he belives that his subjectivity is  objectivity (see also above
&gt; &gt;"working
&gt; &gt;class activists" expelled from Coalition. actually Cliff was expelled and
&gt; &gt;numerous
&gt; &gt;working calss activist remained in the organization but Cliff believes that
&gt; &gt;not only
&gt; &gt;does he represent the working calss but that he is the working class)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Looking at the political line of SWORD especially around the issue of the
&gt; &gt;paper and
&gt; &gt;its production we are actually seeing the ultra-left version of the "office
&gt; &gt;space
&gt; &gt;community center club house" line. That is placing production and the
&gt; &gt;productive
&gt; &gt;forces above politics. Joe nor Cliff is concerned with the political line
&gt; &gt;of the
&gt; &gt;newspaper just "come out with it" "where is it" "hurry up" new and improved
&gt; &gt;revolutionary newsaper faster stronger better than before.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Joe wrote an article, that has been endlessly defended, that stated white
&gt; &gt;workers need
&gt; &gt;reparations along with afro-americans. I am not interested in putting out
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt;political line. Nor am I interested in putting out political lines
&gt; &gt;endorsing
&gt; &gt;"sisterhood".  Politics must lead production not the other way around.
&gt; &gt;Production
&gt; &gt;before politics is the theory of sponatinety and the essence of economism
&gt; &gt;(see "What
&gt; &gt;is To be done")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If SWORD wants to help put out the political line of the U&amp;S editorial
&gt; &gt;board than
&gt; &gt;let's go, but if they insist on being a part of the edit board then first
&gt; &gt;we must come
&gt; &gt;to ideological resolutions. From what has already been sd SWORD believes
&gt; &gt;that helping
&gt; &gt;with production is exploitation. We certainly do not intend to exploit
&gt; &gt;anyones
&gt; &gt;resources.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe- It seems Curtis' unfortunate "confession" makes your positions
&gt; &gt;right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about him &amp; mine wrong.  To the extent that this is so, I was wrong to
&gt; &gt;say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you lied about his past.  However, we will certainly continue to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;explore the role that BOL/SWORD played in pushing him back into the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican fold--as we will be struggling to win over many many working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;class people from the Republican party. There was a time not too long
&gt; &gt;ago
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that we were reading DuBois &amp; Baraka's Black Nation together...As we've
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;agreed the NBPC didn't put out warnings against Republican danger, etc.
&gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the one hand, but on the other I maintain that dogmatism, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Marxism-Leninism, caused BOL not to embrace his democratic tendencies.
&gt; &gt;&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the extent that they still exist, they will obviously run completely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;counter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to the objectives of the racist, imperialist, not-about-to-be-reformed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican Party, hopefully causing distress.  (Curtis- I say this to
&gt; &gt;you:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The less distress your embrace of the Republicans causes you, the more
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self interest has won over the interests of the people, even Sissy
&gt; &gt;Adams.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally, it was Cliff's statement that U&amp;S was exploiting your
&gt; &gt;resources
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;directly following our "unity meeting" that made us more serious about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-reliant, an innevitable and necessary move. (CS:..."Though our
&gt; &gt;lay-out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and distribution resources are readily exploited.") As far as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;definitive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship that exists between U&amp;S &amp; SWORD, I would say talk to AB,
&gt; &gt;try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to

Cliff,


&gt; "explain, please:
&gt;
&gt; why is "reparations" exclusively specific to chattel slavery &amp; national
&gt; oppression? tho these are no doubt primary over narrow class struggle."

I think that I explained this in another e-mail. But if you want to raise a demand for
repartaions outside of that one you should start by making it clear and distinct
rather than have it collapseing the two. The point is that reparations for chattle
slavery is a specific demand that shouldn't be confused with other demands that have
other purposes.

&gt; if the multinational working class got class reparations, as oppressed
&gt; nations get national reparations, and women, sexual reparations, in their
&gt; differing forms &amp; according to priority of oppression (sex, nation, class),
&gt; how wd this impede multinational unity?
&gt;

The point is that  they are separate and distinct demnads. U&amp;S support for reparations
for chattel slavery does not imply support or lack of for any other form of
reperations. They are seperate.

&gt;
&gt; true, "ideological unity" is required to produce a revolutionary newspaper.
&gt; but also not as absolute inflexible demand. else no 2 people cd ever work
&gt; together.  there is also need to work cooperatively through certain
&gt; disagreements, toward resolution.

Cliff, we tried to woirk together on the edit board and from my point of veiw it
proved impossible because the points that we disagreed upon are the most important
points to SWORD. That is they were raised over and over again to the point were
editorial work that needed to get done did not.


&gt; standards, or criterion, of principles of unity shd be made specific, as
&gt; seemingly was in "revolutionaries unite! win the advanced to communism!", to
&gt; which what is the actual dis-unity?.  blanket demand of   100% complete
&gt; "ideological unity" before 1 step of practical unity is a strategy to
&gt; disorganize, not organize.

We will try to be as specific as possible. BUt I don't think that U&amp;S is the forum to
unite Marxist-Leninist and feminists for instance although we can and should work
together on other projects.
I agree that there is some lack of clarity around this and I hope that we can become
clear.

&gt; &gt; &gt; reasons why reparations for blacks is wrong... you were at rutger's last
&gt; &gt; &gt; semester weren't you? didn't catch your position, where is it? do you
&gt; &gt;agree
&gt; &gt; &gt; that your boss should rob you?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm not sure exactly what your saying, but as to my boss robbing me or any
&gt; &gt;boss
&gt; &gt;robbing anyone,  that it is not the issue of reparations. You are confusing
&gt; &gt;two
&gt; &gt;distinct things. Reparations for afro-americacans are repeartions for
&gt; &gt;chattel slavery.
&gt; &gt;Reparations is one of the ways to create equality among the multi-national
&gt; &gt;working
&gt; &gt;calss so that unity is easier to achieve. If white workers throughout the
&gt; &gt;U&amp;S got
&gt; &gt;repartions along with afro-american workers then the relationship would not
&gt; &gt;change.You
&gt; &gt;are making the demand for reparations a demand for socialism.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "i don't see any working class people in the capb, how is it that u do?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;When the coalition existed it was primarily a working class organization.
&gt; &gt;If you are
&gt; &gt;gloating about its demise I don't know what to tell you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "you are off the wall to explain your arguements from such basis."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't know what that sentence is refering to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Politics must lead production not the other way around."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That's my line, I don't think that you answered it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the differences in our ideologies are on the table, what else needs to
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; done to put forward the newspaper collectively? the concept of u&amp;s is to
&gt; &gt; &gt; unite revolutionaries, and to win the advanced to communism! not to sit
&gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; meetings until we all agree with your IDEAS, because we both know your
&gt; &gt; &gt; practice is out to lunch...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I raised the question of putting froward the paper collectively very
&gt; &gt;specificly in the
&gt; &gt;piece to whihc you responded.
&gt; &gt;the issue is:
&gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board is
&gt; &gt;one trend.
&gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working relationship
&gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't think that we both know my "practice is out to lunch". If this were
&gt; &gt;the case
&gt; &gt;than why would you be so eager to unite with it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; keith, the fact is i have seen you expell and disassociate yourself from
&gt; &gt; &gt; more revolutionary/working class people than i've seen you organize. if
&gt; &gt;i
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn't call amiri and set up a meeting, which you and matt had
&gt; &gt;cancelled, i
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't see reason that there would be any production going on at all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Actaully I don't think that you know much about my practice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  We re-scheduled the meeting because Baraka was not going to be in town on
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;original date and you came to that meeting
&gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt;I especially like the super subjective grandiose vision of yrself.  " i
&gt; &gt;don't see
&gt; &gt;reason that there would be any production going on at all."  Are you also
&gt; &gt;actaully the
&gt; &gt;emobiement of Reason that travels throughout history on whose behalf all
&gt; &gt;people are
&gt; &gt;acting?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the reason the same criticism is coming forward about the republicans in
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; peoples' campaign is because the situation has not been rectified. nor
&gt; &gt;have
&gt; &gt; &gt; you offered anything more than a mere admittance to things impossible to
&gt; &gt; &gt; deny about your affiliation with such alliances with republicans. what
&gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; your plan keith to rectify the situation, because as it is dim is on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; housing authority - that is your bag.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You can make the criticism untill the cows come home. Your proposal for
&gt; &gt;rectification
&gt; &gt;is to expel the republicans and re-admit you.
&gt; &gt;I already sd that I agree republicans should be expelled from the
&gt; &gt;organization and
&gt; &gt;that SWORD should be united with in the People's Campaign.But I think that
&gt; &gt;it is more
&gt; &gt;important that the majority of people involved with the camapign understand
&gt; &gt;what is
&gt; &gt;happening and what mistakes were made, otherwise they will just be repeated
&gt; &gt;(maybe
&gt; &gt;with an ultra-left cover).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; "I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear
&gt; &gt;ideological
&gt; &gt; &gt; leadership and bad political line which came to head in the People's
&gt; &gt; &gt; Campaign with support for bright and suppression of an anti-republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; political line and a lack of any revolutionary polirtical line."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; but what are you going to do?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think that you are just repeating yrself here, but again maybe I'm
&gt; &gt;blinded by
&gt; &gt;ignorance if so please cast the light. Otherwise see my reply above.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; who is going to lead the vote to announce all republicans must be
&gt; &gt;removed
&gt; &gt; &gt; and are not welcome in the New Brunswick Peoples' Campaign because in
&gt; &gt;fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; the racist republicans party is the most vicous opposition to the
&gt; &gt;peoples
&gt; &gt; &gt; productive development?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think that this is the same again.
&gt; &gt;But I do have a question. What is "the peoples productive development"?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I tried to answer the isues you raise, but since this reply is a little
&gt; &gt;lengthy, I
&gt; &gt;would reiterate this point as being central:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board is a
&gt; &gt;single
&gt; &gt;trend.
&gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working relationship
&gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative. First, editorial unity is not possible until
&gt; &gt;there is a
&gt; &gt;change in political line.Secondly,  if the current relationship is termed
&gt; &gt;"exploitative" then it must change. There's the problem. I have made more
&gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt;proposal for its solution. As far as I am concerned its on you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Date: Mon, 07 Jan 1980 11:17:24 -0500
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To respond to Cliff's comments
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "what is "unfortunate" about curtis' "confession"?  it is like fresh
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;air."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree. Curtis explaining his position brings clarity, I think Matt's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;meaning is that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it is unfortunate that Curtis is loyal to the Republicans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "while yr "exploring", you might "explore" yr own responsibility for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;curtis'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; republican betrayal.  he comes from yr organization, the CAPB, from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you (henson-style) embraced the right &amp; expelled working class
&gt; &gt;activists
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revolutionaries.  where is the CAPB now?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear
&gt; &gt;ideological
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;leadership
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and bad political line which came to head in the People's Campaign with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;support for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;bright and suppression of an anti-republican political line and a lack
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;revolutionary polirtical line.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "you might also "explore" how not only did yr NBPC not only "not put
&gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings of the republican danger", but encouraged curtis to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;republican,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created a "communist" "ideology" to support it, &amp; in fact yrselves
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;embraced
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; republican partying"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This is true enough although it has already been criticized on numerous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;occassions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "recognize that curtis does not proclaim to "reform" the republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;party,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather to "reform" its "image"--that is to find more liberal marks
&gt; &gt;like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yrself to con."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That is how Curtis stated his case and that certainly seems to be in
&gt; &gt;line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;compassionate conservativism strategy of Shundler/Bush and even the
&gt; &gt;most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;extreme right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wing section of the Buchanan reform party who even nominated Foster as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their VP an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;afro-american woman. (although that shopuld also tell us something
&gt; &gt;about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;limitations of "woman" based ideology (ie."sisterhood" as well as black
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nationalism)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ""finally", why shd it take my remarks to make you "serious about
&gt; &gt;being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-reliant" (which you apparently aren't, judging from the absence
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paper)?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We don't want to exploit anyone. yr "remarks" made it clear to me that
&gt; &gt;you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feel that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the relationship we had as to production of the paper was
&gt; &gt;"exploitative"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "as far as the definitive relationship between U&amp;S &amp; SWORD" we stand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ready
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to produce the paper as a collective organizer &amp; struggle through
&gt; &gt;our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differences.  as you apparently are uninterested in our involvement
&gt; &gt;(&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;even,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apparently, in yr own production!), you shd, openly &amp; above board,
&gt; &gt;state
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;yr
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reasons for sectarian sabotage of the paper."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We have numerous ideological differences which in my opinion make joint
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;editorial work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible at the moment. (not to mention differences of style. I have
&gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;trusting anyone who doesn't believe in friendship for instance and also
&gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working with people who do not believe in trust itself.  Those are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ultra-ultra left
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lines which really resolve as the essence of right-wing ideology see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Mussolini, G.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Gordon Liddy, the SA in Nazi Germany for examples).  Joint editorial
&gt; &gt;work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible given our differences as we learned in practice. That is we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;don't agree on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fundamental issues (in particular reparations (and as a sub heading the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;inability to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be self-critical) and the woman question and  the idea of an
&gt; &gt;organiztaion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;whose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideology is sisterhood is not marxist, it is feminist)  and we wasted
&gt; &gt;mor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;entire edit board meetings debating these points. To let that continue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would have been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the actual sabatage. We discussed working together on production and in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fact the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;newspaper SWORD printed/photocopied. Since then  you have made it clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;short of joint work on the edit board constitutes an exploititive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship. Since
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we are not interetsed in knowingly exoploiting anyone nor are we
&gt; &gt;interested
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in having
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;an edit board of multifarious trends our current relationship or lack
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one is on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As to the continued accusation of sabatage, it is something of a joke.
&gt; &gt;Joe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Smith
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;official spokesman of the oppressed first raised this accusation in his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;essay "Let the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;oppressed speak".  His charge is that Matt did not send HIM articles to
&gt; &gt;lay
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;therefore the newspaper is being sabotaged. This is the same muddled
&gt; &gt;super
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;subjective
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;logic as the title of his piece suggests. Joe has blown up his own
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;subjectyivty to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;point that he belives that his subjectivity is  objectivity (see also
&gt; &gt;above
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"working

&gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;numerous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working calss activist remained in the organization but Cliff believes
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;does he represent the working calss but that he is the working class)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Looking at the political line of SWORD especially around the issue of
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;paper and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;its production we are actually seeing the ultra-left version of the
&gt; &gt;"office
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;space
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;community center club house" line. That is placing production and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;productive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;forces above politics. Joe nor Cliff is concerned with the political
&gt; &gt;line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;newspaper just "come out with it" "where is it" "hurry up" new and
&gt; &gt;improved
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;revolutionary newsaper faster stronger better than before.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe wrote an article, that has been endlessly defended, that stated
&gt; &gt;white
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;workers need
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reparations along with afro-americans. I am not interested in putting
&gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;political line. Nor am I interested in putting out political lines
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;endorsing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"sisterhood".  Politics must lead production not the other way around.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Production
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;before politics is the theory of sponatinety and the essence of
&gt; &gt;economism
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(see "What
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is To be done")
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If SWORD wants to help put out the political line of the U&amp;S editorial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;board than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;let's go, but if they insist on being a part of the edit board then
&gt; &gt;first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we must come
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to ideological resolutions. From what has already been sd SWORD
&gt; &gt;believes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that helping
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with production is exploitation. We certainly do not intend to exploit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;anyones
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resources.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe- It seems Curtis' unfortunate "confession" makes your positions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about him &amp; mine wrong.  To the extent that this is so, I was wrong
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you lied about his past.  However, we will certainly continue
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;explore the role that BOL/SWORD played in pushing him back into the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican fold--as we will be struggling to win over many many
&gt; &gt;working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;class people from the Republican party. There was a time not too
&gt; &gt;long
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ago
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that we were reading DuBois &amp; Baraka's Black Nation together...As
&gt; &gt;we've
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;agreed the NBPC didn't put out warnings against Republican danger,
&gt; &gt;etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the one hand, but on the other I maintain that dogmatism, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Marxism-Leninism, caused BOL not to embrace his democratic
&gt; &gt;tendencies.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the extent that they still exist, they will obviously run
&gt; &gt;completely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;counter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to the objectives of the racist, imperialist,
&gt; &gt;not-about-to-be-reformed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican Party, hopefully causing distress.  (Curtis- I say this
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The less distress your embrace of the Republicans causes you, the
&gt; &gt;more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self interest has won over the interests of the people, even Sissy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Adams.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally, it was Cliff's statement that U&amp;S was exploiting your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resources
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;directly following our "unity meeting" that made us more serious
&gt; &gt;about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-reliant, an innevitable and necessary move. (CS:..."Though our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lay-out

<pre>Jeremy and anyone else interetsed,

You sd Marxism is feminist. I assume that you don't mean reduces to feminism but
somehow encompasses it. However there needs to be some distinction drawn. While there
are a wide variety of feminist ideologies they have some basic assumptions in common.
First, that the primary struggle in history is between men and women rather than
social classes, or at least that the struggle between men and women is more
significant. Secondly that there is a source of the oppression/exploitation of women
other than private property that plays a definitive role, usually some kind of
biological determinism.
As oppossed to the arguemnt that Engels makes in the "Origins of the Family, Private
Property and the State". He argues basing himself on the anthrology of Morgan, that
there was a time before the emergence of private property that women and men were
basicly equal. He argues that whatever division of labor existed didn't necessitate
any inequality. For Marxism the origins of the oppression of women are found in the
rise of private property and likewise the emancipation of women is connected to the
overthrow of private property. Feminism usually doesn't have any story to tell about
the emancipation of women.

    so if  you mean to say that Marxism is concerned about the emancipation of women
and sees that as a part of its project, I agree. But I do think that there are
important distinctions between Marxism and feminism.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I think that yr insistence on the term "sex" as oppossed

&gt; opression of women
&gt; &gt; takes both forms. Sex oppression having to do with reproduction
&gt; while it may be the
&gt; &gt; basis of gender oppression does not reduce to it.
&gt;
&gt; I would tend to think you're fundamentally in the right here.  (I
&gt; don't see how the opposite is even remotely arguable).
&gt;
&gt; If you're a Marxist, the problem is _relations of production_.
&gt; Gender is relational, and thefore the real political and economic (in
&gt; a variety of senses) issue.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, the term "oppression" is also misleading.  Oppression
&gt; refers to open, selfconscious force by the state, typically.  Force
&gt; and Power are two different concepts.  If you don't accept this,
&gt; modern political problems become unintelligible.  (In fact, if you
&gt; don't accept this, you're not a Marxist.  The concept of _ideology_
&gt; depends upon the force/power distinction).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am not against sisterhood and struggle. I don't believe that it
&gt; is marxism-leninsm,
&gt; &gt; I think that it is feminism. I'm not against NOW either.
&gt; &gt; But what is SWORD's position.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know about Lenin's Marxism in this sense, but Marxism, if

<pre>Cliff,
the "proof" is this:
"Reperations for the multi-national working class!!" -Joe Smith

as I wrote below that line is a liquidation of the national question. This shouild be
obvious to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Marxism-Leninism.

again
since we have ideological disagreements, this being a case in point, and since you
feel that our relationship was exploitive how are we going to work togther?
I am starting to think that you are avoiding the point.

&gt; &gt;Joe,
&gt; &gt;yr slogan "Reperations for the multi-national working class!!" is
&gt; &gt;trotskyism.
&gt; &gt;U&amp;S put forward and has been struggling for reperations for slavery for the
&gt; &gt;afro-american nation. Your slogan liquidates the demand and operates under
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;unstated assumption that equality has already been achieved among the
&gt; &gt;multi-natuional
&gt; &gt;working class- that's trotskyism. The slogan is militant reformism. It
&gt; &gt;makes no
&gt; &gt;distinction between the minimum and maximum program but actually collapses
&gt; &gt;the two.
&gt; &gt;Maybe yr rrrrrrevolutionary practice should include studying
&gt; &gt;marxism-leninism.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that your boss should rob you?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I'm not sure exactly what your saying, but as to my boss robbing me or
&gt; &gt;any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;boss
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;robbing anyone,  that it is not the issue of reparations. You are
&gt; &gt;confusing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;distinct things. Reparations for afro-americacans are repeartions for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;chattel slavery.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Reparations is one of the ways to create equality among the
&gt; &gt;multi-national
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;calss so that unity is easier to achieve. If white workers throughout
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;U&amp;S got
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;repartions along with afro-american workers then the relationship would
&gt; &gt;not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;change.You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;are making the demand for reparations a demand for socialism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "i don't see any working class people in the capb, how is it that u
&gt; &gt;do?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;When the coalition existed it was primarily a working class
&gt; &gt;organization.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;gloating about its demise I don't know what to tell you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "you are off the wall to explain your arguements from such basis."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't know what that sentence is refering to.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "Politics must lead production not the other way around."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That's my line, I don't think that you answered it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the differences in our ideologies are on the table, what else needs
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done to put forward the newspaper collectively? the concept of u&amp;s
&gt; &gt;is to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unite revolutionaries, and to win the advanced to communism! not to
&gt; &gt;sit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meetings until we all agree with your IDEAS, because we both know
&gt; &gt;your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice is out to lunch...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I raised the question of putting froward the paper collectively very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;specificly in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;piece to whihc you responded.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the issue is:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board
&gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one trend.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working
&gt; &gt;relationship
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't think that we both know my "practice is out to lunch". If this
&gt; &gt;were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the case
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than why would you be so eager to unite with it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keith, the fact is i have seen you expell and disassociate yourself

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;cancelled, i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't see reason that there would be any production going on at all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Actaully I don't think that you know much about my practice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  We re-scheduled the meeting because Baraka was not going to be in
&gt; &gt;town on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;original date and you came to that meeting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I especially like the super subjective grandiose vision of yrself.  " i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;don't see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reason that there would be any production going on at all."  Are you
&gt; &gt;also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;actaully the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;emobiement of Reason that travels throughout history on whose behalf
&gt; &gt;all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;people are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;acting?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the reason the same criticism is coming forward about the
&gt; &gt;republicans in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peoples' campaign is because the situation has not been rectified.
&gt; &gt;nor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you offered anything more than a mere admittance to things
&gt; &gt;impossible to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deny about your affiliation with such alliances with republicans.
&gt; &gt;what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your plan keith to rectify the situation, because as it is dim is on
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; housing authority - that is your bag.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You can make the criticism untill the cows come home. Your proposal for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rectification
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is to expel the republicans and re-admit you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I already sd that I agree republicans should be expelled from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;organization and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that SWORD should be united with in the People's Campaign.But I think
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it is more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;important that the majority of people involved with the camapign
&gt; &gt;understand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;happening and what mistakes were made, otherwise they will just be
&gt; &gt;repeated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with an ultra-left cover).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideological
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leadership and bad political line which came to head in the People's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Campaign with support for bright and suppression of an
&gt; &gt;anti-republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political line and a lack of any revolutionary polirtical line."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but what are you going to do?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think that you are just repeating yrself here, but again maybe I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;blinded by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ignorance if so please cast the light. Otherwise see my reply above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who is going to lead the vote to announce all republicans must be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;removed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and are not welcome in the New Brunswick Peoples' Campaign because
&gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the racist republicans party is the most vicous opposition to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;peoples
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; productive development?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think that this is the same again.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But I do have a question. What is "the peoples productive development"?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I tried to answer the isues you raise, but since this reply is a little
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lengthy, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would reiterate this point as being central:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board
&gt; &gt;is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;single
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;trend.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working
&gt; &gt;relationship
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative. First, editorial unity is not possible until
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;there is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;change in political line.Secondly,  if the current relationship is
&gt; &gt;termed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"exploitative" then it must change. There's the problem. I have made
&gt; &gt;more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;proposal for its solution. As far as I am concerned its on you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To respond to Cliff's comments
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "what is "unfortunate" about curtis' "confession"?  it is like
&gt; &gt;fresh
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;air."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree. Curtis explaining his position brings clarity, I think
&gt; &gt;Matt's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;meaning is that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it is unfortunate that Curtis is loyal to the Republicans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "while yr "exploring", you might "explore" yr own responsibility
&gt; &gt;for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;curtis'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; republican betrayal.  he comes from yr organization, the CAPB,
&gt; &gt;from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you (henson-style) embraced the right &amp; expelled working class
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;activists
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revolutionaries.  where is the CAPB now?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideological
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;leadership
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and bad political line which came to head in the People's Campaign
&gt; &gt;with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;support for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;bright and suppression of an anti-republican political line and a
&gt; &gt;lack
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;revolutionary polirtical line.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "you might also "explore" how not only did yr NBPC not only "not
&gt; &gt;put
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings of the republican danger", but encouraged curtis to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;republican,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created a "communist" "ideology" to support it, &amp; in fact
&gt; &gt;yrselves
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;embraced
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; republican partying"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This is true enough although it has already been criticized on
&gt; &gt;numerous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;occassions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "recognize that curtis does not proclaim to "reform" the
&gt; &gt;republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;party,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather to "reform" its "image"--that is to find more liberal
&gt; &gt;marks
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yrself to con."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That is how Curtis stated his case and that certainly seems to be
&gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;compassionate conservativism strategy of Shundler/Bush and even the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;extreme right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wing section of the Buchanan reform party who even nominated Foster
&gt; &gt;as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their VP an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;afro-american woman. (although that shopuld also tell us something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;limitations of "woman" based ideology (ie."sisterhood" as well as
&gt; &gt;black
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nationalism)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ""finally", why shd it take my remarks to make you "serious
&gt; &gt;about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-reliant" (which you apparently aren't, judging from the
&gt; &gt;absence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paper)?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We don't want to exploit anyone. yr "remarks" made it clear to me
&gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feel that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the relationship we had as to production of the paper was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"exploitative"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "as far as the definitive relationship between U&amp;S &amp; SWORD" we
&gt; &gt;stand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ready
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to produce the paper as a collective organizer &amp; struggle

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;even,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apparently, in yr own production!), you shd, openly &amp; above

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;state
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;yr
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reasons for sectarian sabotage of the paper."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We have numerous ideological differences which in my opinion make
&gt; &gt;joint
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;editorial work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible at the moment. (not to mention differences of style. I
&gt; &gt;have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;trusting anyone who doesn't believe in friendship for instance and
&gt; &gt;also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;hard time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working with people who do not believe in trust itself.  Those are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ultra-ultra left
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lines which really resolve as the essence of right-wing ideology
&gt; &gt;see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Mussolini, G.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Gordon Liddy, the SA in Nazi Germany for examples).  Joint
&gt; &gt;editorial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible given our differences as we learned in practice. That is
&gt; &gt;we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;don't agree on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fundamental issues (in particular reparations (and as a sub heading
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;inability to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be self-critical) and the woman question and  the idea of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;organiztaion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;whose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideology is sisterhood is not marxist, it is feminist)  and we
&gt; &gt;wasted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;mor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;entire edit board meetings debating these points. To let that
&gt; &gt;continue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would have been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the actual sabatage. We discussed working together on production
&gt; &gt;and in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fact the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;newspaper SWORD printed/photocopied. Since then  you have made it
&gt; &gt;clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;short of joint work on the edit board constitutes an exploititive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship. Since
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we are not interetsed in knowingly exoploiting anyone nor are we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;interested
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in having
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;an edit board of multifarious trends our current relationship or
&gt; &gt;lack
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one is on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As to the continued accusation of sabatage, it is something of a
&gt; &gt;joke.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Smith
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;official spokesman of the oppressed first raised this accusation in
&gt; &gt;his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;essay "Let the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;oppressed speak".  His charge is that Matt did not send HIM
&gt; &gt;articles to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lay
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;therefore the newspaper is being sabotaged. This is the same
&gt; &gt;muddled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;super
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;subjective
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;logic as the title of his piece suggests. Joe has blown up his own
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;subjectyivty to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;point that he belives that his subjectivity is  objectivity (see
&gt; &gt;also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;above
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;class activists" expelled from Coalition. actually Cliff was
&gt; &gt;expelled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;numerous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working calss activist remained in the organization but Cliff
&gt; &gt;believes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;does he represent the working calss but that he is the working
&gt; &gt;class)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Looking at the political line of SWORD especially around the issue
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;paper and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;its production we are actually seeing the ultra-left version of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"office
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;space
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;community center club house" line. That is placing production and
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;productive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;forces above politics. Joe nor Cliff is concerned with the
&gt; &gt;political
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;newspaper just "come out with it" "where is it" "hurry up" new and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;improved
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;revolutionary newsaper faster stronger better than before.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe wrote an article, that has been endlessly defended, that stated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;white
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;workers need
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reparations along with afro-americans. I am not interested in
&gt; &gt;putting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;political line. Nor am I interested in putting out political lines
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;endorsing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"sisterhood".  Politics must lead production not the other way
&gt; &gt;around.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Production
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;before politics is the theory of sponatinety and the essence of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;economism
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(see "What
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is To be done")
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If SWORD wants to help put out the political line of the U&amp;S
&gt; &gt;editorial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;board than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;let's go, but if they insist on being a part of the edit board then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we must come
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to ideological resolutions. From what has already been sd SWORD
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;believes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that helping
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with production is exploitation. We certainly do not intend to
&gt; &gt;exploit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;anyones
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resources.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "scientific socialists dismiss "luck".
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Actually, luck is part of that which can not be understood at
&gt; &gt;present
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;predicted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with accuracy. For instance wheather at a rally.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unite, don't split
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"....First of all, we are discussing party literature and its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;subordination
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to party
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;control. Everyone is free to write and say whatever he likes,
&gt; &gt;without
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;restrictions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But every voluntary association (including the party) is also free

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;expel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;memers who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;use the name of the party to advocate anti-party views. Freedom of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;speech
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;press must be complete. But then freedom of association must be

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe- It seems Curtis' unfortunate "confession" makes your
&gt; &gt;positions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about him &amp; mine wrong.  To the extent that this is so, I was
&gt; &gt;wrong
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you lied about his past.  However, we will certainly
&gt; &gt;continue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;explore the role that BOL/SWORD played in pushing him back into
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican fold--as we will be struggling to win over many many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;class people from the Republican party. There was a time not
&gt; &gt;too
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;long
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ago
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that we were reading DuBois &amp; Baraka's Black Nation
&gt; &gt;together...As
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we've
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;agreed the NBPC didn't put out warnings against Republican
&gt; &gt;danger,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the one hand, but on the other I maintain that dogmatism, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Marxism-Leninism, caused BOL not to embrace his democratic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tendencies.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the extent that they still exist, they will obviously run
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;completely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;counter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to the objectives of the racist, imperialist,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not-about-to-be-reformed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican Party, hopefully causing distress.  (Curtis- I say
&gt; &gt;this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The less distress your embrace of the Republicans causes you,
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self interest has won over the interests of the people, even
&gt; &gt;Sissy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Adams.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally, it was Cliff's statement that U&amp;S was exploiting your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resources
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;directly following our "unity meeting" that made us more
&gt; &gt;serious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-reliant, an innevitable and necessary move. (CS:..."Though
&gt; &gt;our
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lay-out

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;definitive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship that exists between U&amp;S &amp; SWORD, I would say talk

<pre>My question is directed at Joe or Cliff,

Since we have ideological disagreements that prevent us from jointly working on the
edit board of U&amp;S and since you have stated that our previuos relationship was
exploitation, what do you propose to do?
this is not a rhetorical question. I would sincerely like to know.

<pre>Joe,
this statement of yours:
"the threats i received by manny and letti are not forgotten, you
want what they got comin? keep talkin'"
is more manure for cointelpro
If you constanly have to resort to meek threats when your ability to make a coherent
arguemnt fails: why would anyone want to work with you on anything?

I think I already asked this question 7 or 8 times but just for kicks I'll ask again:
How do you propose to work together if you think that we are exploiting you?

Keith

&gt;      Keith and Matt and Louise are the only ones saying that we
&gt;      can not work together. They have been saying that for the last six
&gt;      years. That has been their entire practice towards uniting
&gt;      revolutionaries and winning the advanced to communism.
&gt;
&gt; and to matt, again you should watch your mouth especially for matters you
&gt; were not there to observe. you talk as if you attended kimako's, which you
&gt; did not - the threats i received by manny and letti are not forgotten, you

&gt; &gt;the "proof" is this:

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;as I wrote below that line is a liquidation of the national question. This

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;again
&gt; &gt;since we have ideological disagreements, this being a case in point, and
&gt; &gt;since you
&gt; &gt;feel that our relationship was exploitive how are we going to work togther?
&gt; &gt;I am starting to think that you are avoiding the point.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;yr slogan "Reperations for the multi-national working class!!" is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;trotskyism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;U&amp;S put forward and has been struggling for reperations for slavery for
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;afro-american nation. Your slogan liquidates the demand and operates
&gt; &gt;under
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;unstated assumption that equality has already been achieved among the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;multi-natuional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working class- that's trotskyism. The slogan is militant reformism. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;makes no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;distinction between the minimum and maximum program but actually
&gt; &gt;collapses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the two.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Maybe yr rrrrrrevolutionary practice should include studying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;marxism-leninism.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;When the coalition existed it was primarily a working class
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;organization.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;gloating about its demise I don't know what to tell you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "you are off the wall to explain your arguements from such
&gt; &gt;basis."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't know what that sentence is refering to.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "Politics must lead production not the other way around."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That's my line, I don't think that you answered it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the differences in our ideologies are on the table, what else
&gt; &gt;needs
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done to put forward the newspaper collectively? the concept of
&gt; &gt;u&amp;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unite revolutionaries, and to win the advanced to communism! not
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meetings until we all agree with your IDEAS, because we both
&gt; &gt;know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice is out to lunch...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I raised the question of putting froward the paper collectively
&gt; &gt;very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;specificly in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;piece to whihc you responded.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the issue is:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit
&gt; &gt;board
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one trend.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your
&gt; &gt;brother.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't think that we both know my "practice is out to lunch". If
&gt; &gt;this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the case
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than why would you be so eager to unite with it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keith, the fact is i have seen you expell and disassociate
&gt; &gt;yourself
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more revolutionary/working class people than i've seen you
&gt; &gt;organize.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn't call amiri and set up a meeting, which you and matt had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;cancelled, i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't see reason that there would be any production going on at
&gt; &gt;all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Actaully I don't think that you know much about my practice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  We re-scheduled the meeting because Baraka was not going to be in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;town on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;original date and you came to that meeting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I especially like the super subjective grandiose vision of yrself.
&gt; &gt;" i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;don't see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reason that there would be any production going on at all."  Are
&gt; &gt;you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;actaully the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;emobiement of Reason that travels throughout history on whose
&gt; &gt;behalf
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;people are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;acting?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the reason the same criticism is coming forward about the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;republicans in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peoples' campaign is because the situation has not been
&gt; &gt;rectified.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you offered anything more than a mere admittance to things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deny about your affiliation with such alliances with
&gt; &gt;republicans.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your plan keith to rectify the situation, because as it is dim
&gt; &gt;is on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; housing authority - that is your bag.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You can make the criticism untill the cows come home. Your proposal
&gt; &gt;for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rectification
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is to expel the republicans and re-admit you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I already sd that I agree republicans should be expelled from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;organization and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that SWORD should be united with in the People's Campaign.But I
&gt; &gt;think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it is more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;important that the majority of people involved with the camapign
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;understand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;happening and what mistakes were made, otherwise they will just be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;repeated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with an ultra-left cover).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideological
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leadership and bad political line which came to head in the
&gt; &gt;People's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Campaign with support for bright and suppression of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;anti-republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political line and a lack of any revolutionary polirtical line."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but what are you going to do?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think that you are just repeating yrself here, but again maybe
&gt; &gt;I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;blinded by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ignorance if so please cast the light. Otherwise see my reply
&gt; &gt;above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who is going to lead the vote to announce all republicans must
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;removed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and are not welcome in the New Brunswick Peoples' Campaign
&gt; &gt;because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the racist republicans party is the most vicous opposition to
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;peoples
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; productive development?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think that this is the same again.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But I do have a question. What is "the peoples productive
&gt; &gt;development"?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I tried to answer the isues you raise, but since this reply is a
&gt; &gt;little
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lengthy, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would reiterate this point as being central:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit
&gt; &gt;board
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;single
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;trend.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your
&gt; &gt;brother.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative. First, editorial unity is not possible
&gt; &gt;until
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;there is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;change in political line.Secondly,  if the current relationship is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;termed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"exploitative" then it must change. There's the problem. I have
&gt; &gt;made
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;proposal for its solution. As far as I am concerned its on you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To respond to Cliff's comments
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "what is "unfortunate" about curtis' "confession"?  it is
&gt; &gt;like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fresh
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;air."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree. Curtis explaining his position brings clarity, I think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Matt's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;meaning is that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it is unfortunate that Curtis is loyal to the Republicans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "while yr "exploring", you might "explore" yr own
&gt; &gt;responsibility
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;curtis'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; republican betrayal.  he comes from yr organization, the
&gt; &gt;CAPB,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you (henson-style) embraced the right &amp; expelled working
&gt; &gt;class
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;activists
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&amp;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revolutionaries.  where is the CAPB now?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideological
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;leadership
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and bad political line which came to head in the People's
&gt; &gt;Campaign
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;support for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;bright and suppression of an anti-republican political line and
&gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lack
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;revolutionary polirtical line.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "you might also "explore" how not only did yr NBPC not only
&gt; &gt;"not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;put
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warnings of the republican danger", but encouraged curtis to
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;republican,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created a "communist" "ideology" to support it, &amp; in fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;yrselves
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;embraced
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; republican partying"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This is true enough although it has already been criticized on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;numerous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;occassions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "recognize that curtis does not proclaim to "reform" the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;party,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather to "reform" its "image"--that is to find more liberal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;marks
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yrself to con."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That is how Curtis stated his case and that certainly seems to
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;compassionate conservativism strategy of Shundler/Bush and even

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We have numerous ideological differences which in my opinion
&gt; &gt;make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;joint
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;editorial work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible at the moment. (not to mention differences of style.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible given our differences as we learned in practice.
&gt; &gt;That is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;don't agree on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fundamental issues (in particular reparations (and as a sub

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;whose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideology is sisterhood is not marxist, it is feminist)  and we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wasted

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;entire edit board meetings debating these points. To let that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;continue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would have been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the actual sabatage. We discussed working together on
&gt; &gt;production
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fact the last
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;newspaper SWORD printed/photocopied. Since then  you have made
&gt; &gt;it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;short of joint work on the edit board constitutes an
&gt; &gt;exploititive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship. Since
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we are not interetsed in knowingly exoploiting anyone nor are
&gt; &gt;we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;interested

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As to the continued accusation of sabatage, it is something of
&gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;joke.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Smith
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;official spokesman of the oppressed first raised this
&gt; &gt;accusation in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;essay "Let the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;oppressed speak".  His charge is that Matt did not send HIM
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;articles to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lay
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;therefore the newspaper is being sabotaged. This is the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;muddled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;super
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;subjective
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;logic as the title of his piece suggests. Joe has blown up his
&gt; &gt;own
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;subjectyivty to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;point that he belives that his subjectivity is  objectivity
&gt; &gt;(see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;also

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;does he represent the working calss but that he is the working

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Looking at the political line of SWORD especially around the
&gt; &gt;issue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;paper and

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;space
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;community center club house" line. That is placing production
&gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;productive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;forces above politics. Joe nor Cliff is concerned with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;political
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;line
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe wrote an article, that has been endlessly defended, that
&gt; &gt;stated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;white
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;workers need
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reparations along with afro-americans. I am not interested in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;putting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;political line. Nor am I interested in putting out political
&gt; &gt;lines
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;endorsing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"sisterhood".  Politics must lead production not the other way
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;around.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Production
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;before politics is the theory of sponatinety and the essence of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;economism
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(see "What
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is To be done")
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If SWORD wants to help put out the political line of the U&amp;S
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;editorial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;board than
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;let's go, but if they insist on being a part of the edit board
&gt; &gt;then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we must come
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to ideological resolutions. From what has already been sd SWORD
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;believes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that helping
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with production is exploitation. We certainly do not intend to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;exploit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;anyones
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resources.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Actually, luck is part of that which can not be understood at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;present

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;predicted

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe- It seems Curtis' unfortunate "confession" makes your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;positions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;right
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about him &amp; mine wrong.  To the extent that this is so, I
&gt; &gt;was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wrong
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you lied about his past.  However, we will certainly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;continue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;explore the role that BOL/SWORD played in pushing him back
&gt; &gt;into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican fold--as we will be struggling to win over many
&gt; &gt;many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;class people from the Republican party. There was a time
&gt; &gt;not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;too
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;long
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ago
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that we were reading DuBois &amp; Baraka's Black Nation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;together...As
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we've
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;agreed the NBPC didn't put out warnings against Republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;danger,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the one hand, but on the other I maintain that dogmatism,
&gt; &gt;not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Marxism-Leninism, caused BOL not to embrace his democratic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tendencies.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;completely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;counter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to the objectives of the racist, imperialist,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not-about-to-be-reformed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican Party, hopefully causing distress.  (Curtis- I
&gt; &gt;say
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The less distress your embrace of the Republicans causes
&gt; &gt;you,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Finally, it was Cliff's statement that U&amp;S was exploiting
&gt; &gt;your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;resources
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;directly following our "unity meeting" that made us more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;serious
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Maybe this is moving forward,

&gt; Since we have ideological disagreements that prevent us from jointly
&gt; &gt;working on the edit board of U&amp;S
&gt;
&gt; that is your position.
&gt;

Our ideological differences are not in my imaginzation. I assume your point is that
they don't prevent us from working together. I agree with that except that they do
prevent us from working on the edit board together.  That is not a six year mystical
grudge, we had two edit board meetings that degenerated into arguements over very
fundamnetal political lines. While we agree on a number of points we have fundamental
disagreements over the issue of the Afro-American national question and the woman
question. I am all for sorting those differences out in the newspaper but not at the
edit board meetings.

&gt; &gt;and since you have stated that our previuos relationship was
&gt; exploitation
&gt;
&gt; keith, i plan on exploiting every resource at my disposal in order to unite

I am not interested in exploiting people who should be my allies. Your response avoids
the point. A claim was made that your organziation was being exploited. I'm not
interested in maintaing such a relationship.

&gt; &gt;what do you propose to do?
&gt;
&gt; i propose that we  put forward our ideological differences open and above
&gt; board through U&amp;S and let the people, at the very least, participate in the
&gt; development of our revolutionary analysis.
&gt;

I already asked Cliff but anyone from yr organziation could write something that is
around 300 words and we will respond and print it. I planned to do that with the piece
that Cliff sent but it was 2000 words and I couldn't find a way to break it down. If
you want you could also break down that article into 300-400 word sections and we
could print it as a series with responses.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;this is not a rhetorical question. I would sincerely like to know.
&gt;
&gt; it is a good question &amp; we ask the same of yourself. for you to continue to
&gt; put forward that we cannot work together is going to work to isolate
&gt; yourself.
&gt;

Here is were you lose me. You can't "ask the same of me". We had a working
relationship and then you said that we were exploiting you. We refuse to be in any
relationship and then be told that we are exploiting people. So that's why I ask you
what you suggest. "We work together" is a little vague. I want to know exactly what is
the relationship going to be that is not exploitative.Then we will  have something to
talk about.

&gt; keith, for six years you have found one reason or another which suit your

&gt; time deny our own political arguements from being printed?

I have been organizing in New Brunswick since the spring of 1994. I worked with yr
brother until the end of 1996. He was expelled from the our organiztion and I
supported that decesion. I have since criticized those decesions and have put forward
what is in my opinion the best explaination of what happened. (since I have sd this
more than once I don't really feel like repeating it agin)  In 2000 we worked togther
again. Again Block on Lock was expelled from the organization. A decesion that I
criticized along with the earlier decesion to expel Cliff. You continue to insist that
there is some kind of conspiracy but the fact remains that I have been pushing to have
sword reinstated to the camapign. It may suit your purpose to conflate the issues iof
the camapaign with the issues of U&amp;S but as far as I am concerned there is a
distinction. U&amp;S has a much higher level of unity than the campaign.
I do deny that I exploit sword and I certainly will not enter into any relationship in
the future and have that accusation be made and remain in the relationship.
We didn't print your line because it was at odds with U&amp;S's line. However, we will
print your line and our response.


&gt; what does that mean, manure for cointelpro? manny and letti threatened my
&gt; life. you were screaming and demanding that we should go out back and fight.
&gt; i am nothing but honest about my life so fuck yourself with this
&gt; counter-intelligence fabrication.

Manure is fertilizer. Your comments (threats) create fertile ground for cointelpro
attacks. If you are interested, there are bunch of books that expose the techniques
and tactics that were used. Ward Churchhill wrote a good one called "Agents of
Repression". cointelpro fed upon internal contradictions and they succeeded in having
Black Panthers and members of United Slaves (of which Baraka was the east coast
leader) kill each other.
I lost my cool at the last Kimako's and apologize for screaming, though I didn't
"demand that we fight", I was asking you what the point of pushing the arguement with
Letti was after it was clear that it was not productive. As far as I could tell the
only place pushing the arguement could go was a physical fight. I also sd that telling
people who you are suppossedly trying to unite with that they are "full of shit" is
not a productive way to have a discussion.  And I for one am not particularly
interested in uniting with people who have a hard time grasping that telling someone
they are "full of shit" is not a way to unite.

Again I am not accussing you of being a part of cointelpro I am trying to point out to
you that making threats and writing things like "go fuck yourself" are not only
counter productive but make the movement vulnerable. It is incomprehensible to me that
you would write "go fuck yourself" to someone you wanted to unite with. Are you that
ignorant of dialectics or even normal human interaction that you cannot grasp that "go
fuck yourself" is what you say when you want to split not unite. Isn't that what "go
fuck yourself means"? Doesn't "go fuck yourself" mean: split.


&gt;
&gt; what is a meek threat?

In my opinion, this statement:
 "you want what they got comin? keep talkin'"
is a meek threat, in addition to the manure that I already spoke about.

&gt; we work together just like that keith... WE WORK TOGETHER
&gt; it is you that forever says you can't do it.

Actually, I asked you to propose someting concrete that we could do together around
the paper that doesn't "exploit" you.
That is my proposal but if you are going to continue with the "go fuck yrself" stuff,
then I don't know what to tell you. (actually I do know, but I will wait and see).
Also Manny and Letti are on the edit board of U&amp;S so whatever " they got comin?" means
I don't see how it can advance unity. But like you say "keep talkin".

&gt; &gt;this statement of yours:
&gt; &gt;"the threats i received by manny and letti are not forgotten, you

&gt; &gt;is more manure for cointelpro
&gt; &gt;If you constanly have to resort to meek threats when your ability to make a

&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;yr slogan "Reperations for the multi-national working class!!" is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;trotskyism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;U&amp;S put forward and has been struggling for reperations for slavery
&gt; &gt;for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;afro-american nation. Your slogan liquidates the demand and
&gt; &gt;operates
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;under
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;unstated assumption that equality has already been achieved among
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;multi-natuional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working class- that's trotskyism. The slogan is militant reformism.
&gt; &gt;It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;makes no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;distinction between the minimum and maximum program but actually

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the two.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;robbing anyone,  that it is not the issue of reparations. You
&gt; &gt;are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;confusing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;distinct things. Reparations for afro-americacans are
&gt; &gt;repeartions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;chattel slavery.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Reparations is one of the ways to create equality among the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;multi-national
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;calss so that unity is easier to achieve. If white workers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;throughout
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;U&amp;S got
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;repartions along with afro-american workers then the
&gt; &gt;relationship
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;change.You
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;are making the demand for reparations a demand for socialism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "i don't see any working class people in the capb, how is it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that u
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;do?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;When the coalition existed it was primarily a working class
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;organization.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;gloating about its demise I don't know what to tell you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "you are off the wall to explain your arguements from such
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;basis."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't know what that sentence is refering to.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "Politics must lead production not the other way around."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That's my line, I don't think that you answered it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the differences in our ideologies are on the table, what
&gt; &gt;else
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;needs
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; done to put forward the newspaper collectively? the concept
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;u&amp;s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unite revolutionaries, and to win the advanced to communism!
&gt; &gt;not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meetings until we all agree with your IDEAS, because we both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;know
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice is out to lunch...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I raised the question of putting froward the paper collectively
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;specificly in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;piece to whihc you responded.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the issue is:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;board
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one trend.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;brother.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I don't think that we both know my "practice is out to lunch".
&gt; &gt;If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the case
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than why would you be so eager to unite with it?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keith, the fact is i have seen you expell and disassociate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;yourself
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more revolutionary/working class people than i've seen you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;organize.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn't call amiri and set up a meeting, which you and matt
&gt; &gt;had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;cancelled, i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't see reason that there would be any production going on
&gt; &gt;at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Actaully I don't think that you know much about my practice.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  We re-scheduled the meeting because Baraka was not going to
&gt; &gt;be in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;town on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;original date and you came to that meeting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I especially like the super subjective grandiose vision of
&gt; &gt;yrself.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;" i
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;don't see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reason that there would be any production going on at all."
&gt; &gt;Are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;actaully the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;emobiement of Reason that travels throughout history on whose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;behalf
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;people are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;acting?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the reason the same criticism is coming forward about the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;republicans in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; peoples' campaign is because the situation has not been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rectified.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you offered anything more than a mere admittance to things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deny about your affiliation with such alliances with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;republicans.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your plan keith to rectify the situation, because as it is
&gt; &gt;dim
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; housing authority - that is your bag.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;You can make the criticism untill the cows come home. Your
&gt; &gt;proposal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;rectification
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is to expel the republicans and re-admit you.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I already sd that I agree republicans should be expelled from
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;organization and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that SWORD should be united with in the People's Campaign.But I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it is more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;important that the majority of people involved with the
&gt; &gt;camapign
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;understand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;what is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;happening and what mistakes were made, otherwise they will just
&gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;repeated
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with an ultra-left cover).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you say:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of
&gt; &gt;clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideological
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leadership and bad political line which came to head in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;People's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Campaign with support for bright and suppression of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;anti-republican
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; political line and a lack of any revolutionary polirtical
&gt; &gt;line."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but what are you going to do?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think that you are just repeating yrself here, but again
&gt; &gt;maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;blinded by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ignorance if so please cast the light. Otherwise see my reply
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who is going to lead the vote to announce all republicans
&gt; &gt;must
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;removed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and are not welcome in the New Brunswick Peoples' Campaign
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the racist republicans party is the most vicous opposition
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;peoples
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; productive development?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I think that this is the same again.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But I do have a question. What is "the peoples productive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;development"?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I tried to answer the isues you raise, but since this reply is
&gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;little
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lengthy, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would reiterate this point as being central:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;board
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;single
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;trend.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;brother.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relationship
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feel is non-exploitative. First, editorial unity is not
&gt; &gt;possible
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;until
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;there is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;change in political line.Secondly,  if the current relationship
&gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;termed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"exploitative" then it must change. There's the problem. I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;made
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than one
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;proposal for its solution. As far as I am concerned its on you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To respond to Cliff's comments
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree. Curtis explaining his position brings clarity, I
&gt; &gt;think
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Matt's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;meaning is that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it is unfortunate that Curtis is loyal to the Republicans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This is true enough although it has already been criticized

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fact the last

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As to the continued accusation of sabatage, it is something
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;joke.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;official spokesman of the oppressed first raised this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;accusation in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;essay "Let the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;forces above politics. Joe nor Cliff is concerned with the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe wrote an article, that has been endlessly defended,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;putting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that

&gt; &gt;way
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;around.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Production
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;before politics is the theory of sponatinety and the
&gt; &gt;essence of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we must come
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to ideological resolutions. From what has already been sd
&gt; &gt;SWORD
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;believes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that helping
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with production is exploitation. We certainly do not intend
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;exploit

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Actually, luck is part of that which can not be understood
&gt; &gt;at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;present

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Joe- It seems Curtis' unfortunate "confession" makes
&gt; &gt;your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;positions

&gt; &gt;I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;was

&gt; &gt;certainly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;continue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;explore the role that BOL/SWORD played in pushing him
&gt; &gt;back
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;into
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Republican fold--as we will be struggling to win over

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that we were reading DuBois &amp; Baraka's Black Nation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;together...As

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;agreed the NBPC didn't put out warnings against
&gt; &gt;Republican

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the one hand, but on the other I maintain that
&gt; &gt;dogmatism,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Marxism-Leninism, caused BOL not to embrace his
&gt; &gt;democratic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;tendencies.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&amp;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;counter

&gt; &gt;To POP- We are forced to confront some unfinished business, with some
&gt; &gt;regret
&gt; &gt;as I would much rather show my support for the great work that this
&gt; &gt;organization has been doing in the community in a more positive way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That said, it is in the spirit of truth and justice to which we all
&gt; &gt;endeavor
&gt; &gt;that we must revisit the charges that Dave Hungerford leveled against U&amp;S,
&gt; &gt;to wit: "threatening violence against him repeatedly over the last three
&gt; &gt;years."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Dismayed by his accusation, I demanded that he produce his evidence, as
&gt; &gt;such
&gt; &gt;charges, if unsubstantiated, can serve as manure for CoIntelPro as
&gt; &gt;effectively as if they were true.  Responding that POP's public e-group
&gt; &gt;list
&gt; &gt;was not the place to air such "evidence" (although, curiously, his charges
&gt; &gt;could be made publically) Dave would undermine any possibility of a public
&gt; &gt;defense, choosing instead to send the "evidence" to me personally.  This is
&gt; &gt;the sort of undemocratic and underhanded behavior that many outside of POP
&gt; &gt;have come to expect from DH, so for the record let his "evidence" be known.
&gt; &gt;(As DH has already sent these allegations over the digital wire, we should
&gt; &gt;no longer be concerned with 'secrecy' issues--as we have said in the past,
&gt; &gt;such transparent veils only hide one from the people, while the feds know
&gt; &gt;just who you are...)

&gt; &gt;Matthew:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. In a paper titled "Once more against 'left-wing' communism and centrism'
&gt; &gt;dated  /17/98, Max Haywood wrote:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If the lone 'Lefty' gets shot in the forest,
&gt; &gt;and there's no one to see it...
&gt; &gt;Is 'Lefty' dead?
&gt; &gt;Dead as a doornail, you better believe!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have always taken this seriously. The question of what influence led
&gt; &gt;Haywood to introduce a death threat is a good one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2.  In June of 1999 Brian Coury telephoned me twice in dispute over a Zip
&gt; &gt;drive. He wanted it and I refused to give it to him. In a distraught voice
&gt; &gt;he threatened to come to my house for it. In another call he said he would
&gt; &gt;see me at the upcoming Five Cities March against police brutality. His
&gt; &gt;voice
&gt; &gt;was loud and his meaning was clear. He did not show.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;3.  In recent e-mails, Joseph McDonough twice called me a "coward." He did
&gt; &gt;this after being removed from a listserv on other people's demand for
&gt; &gt;abusing it - yet it was me with whom he attempted to incite something
&gt; &gt;further.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt;Choosing to maintain pseudonyms of DH's lost sheep of course makes it more
&gt; &gt;confusing, but anyone could figure it out if they were in the least
&gt; &gt;interested.  In defense of these absurd allegations:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. "Max Haywood" hasn't been a part of U&amp;S for over a year, and to extract
&gt; &gt;this quote out of the context of the typically lengthy and verbose polemics
&gt; &gt;that "Max" frequently issued in those days, and then to make believe that
&gt; &gt;it
&gt; &gt;was a "death threat" against Dave's person, is just out to lunch (folks
&gt; &gt;ought to be asking why DH is privy to such documents, for starters)  To
&gt; &gt;answer DH's question as to "why" this metaphore: I would suggest it may be
&gt; &gt;related to the preoccupation with ultra-left terrorist guerilla
&gt; &gt;organizations such as Peru's Shining Path that young revolutionaries were
&gt; &gt;taught to emulate by our once fearless leader turned green. (Wonder where
&gt; &gt;his "boycott election" line originates--Peru was sentenced to 10 years hard
&gt; &gt;time under dictator Fujimori as a result of the same line that brought us
&gt; &gt;Giulliani, Bush, &amp; next, Schundler?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2. Dave admits that he stole our organizations equipment and is upset that
&gt; &gt;we wanted it back?! (That's not all, he also stole U&amp;S' domain name, and
&gt; &gt;forged his own website at that address.) -Still, I don't see the violent
&gt; &gt;threat here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;3. Why he associates this final charge with U&amp;S is anyone's guess.
&gt; &gt;"McDonough" was never on U&amp;S edit board, and hasn't been a member of an
&gt; &gt;organization on U&amp;S edit board since DH led his expulsion from CU 4-5years
&gt; &gt;ago--FOR INSISTING THAT THERE ARE CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN DEMS &amp; REPS, btw!
&gt; &gt;(anyhow, can "McDonough" be blamed for expressing his frustration with DH's
&gt; &gt;practice of "jab &amp; duck, jab &amp; duck"...but again, for the sake of argument,
&gt; &gt;where's the violent threat?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It has been made clear to me by some POP members that they are fed up with
&gt; &gt;this debate between two "camps".  To them, I reiterate that I would rather
&gt; &gt;my contribution to POP come in more positive form in the future.  However,
&gt; &gt;it is unacceptible that someone be able to use an organization to manuever
&gt; &gt;in this underhanded manner, only to seek cover behind pretences of playing
&gt; &gt;the victim.  As I said before, I've seen too many people get hurt by DH
&gt; &gt;line, and the truth will come out, and if we are to help resolve the
&gt; &gt;contradictions in society, we must be willing to face the ones internally.

<pre>Joe,
I don't know how to join the "members only" list but I would imganie that the
exclusive nature of the list is no longer necessary. I will send a msg. to that list
asking that you be adding or that the restrictions be taken off altogther.
I also wanted to say that I don't think that people need to explain why they voted the
way they did. People have a right to their opinion as well as their vote.
I am hoping that ending the policy of excluding sword will lead to a renewed campaign
not more intensive name calling and accusations.
I think that the main tasks before The People's Camapign are until the November
election are:
1. the defeat of Shundler
2. cricticism/summation of past elctorial effort that concludes in re-orientation and
rectification with a set of POU's and renewed vow to the local platform and the
inclusion of a national platform or at least a committment to developing one.
In my opinion the Campaign without POU's and a commitment to the platform is just
chasing ambulances rather than building a movement.  I already sent out this piece
below but I am sending it again. I am hoping that we can build some unity around it.
I think that it can serve as the begining for a rectification and reorientation.

What to do?

     Since the February meeting the People's Campaign has become increasing
disoriented and isolated from any base whatsoever. The meetings following February
have been characterized by petty intrigues, petty debates about organizational
structure, expulsions, and a general crisis of identity. I think this state is
recognized by most but few are clear enough or willing enough to admit it. This state
of affairs has come about because of a bad strategy that was initiated at the founding
meeting of the campaign in January of 2000. The strategy that was put into motion at
said meeting was a united front against local the democratic party. This strategy saw
the local democratic party as the main target and then sought allies on that basis
leading us to ally ourselves with republicans among others. Our out look was short
sighted, narrow and parochial.
     Instead of strategizing to build a movement over the long term we thought only in
terms of the upcoming election. This is a recipe for failure and has put us in the
position we are in today. It has confused the organization and those associated with
it to the point of paralysis. The last meetings resolution to have two main objectives
for the campaign (democracy ordinance and mayor's election 2000) is just more
wandering in the wilderness.
     What we need is a ground up re-organization that begins with a sum up of our
success and failures in our last attempt. This must include a critique of the faulty
strategy that I already mentioned and include a new orientation. The new orientation
should begin with a strategy that states clearly that the Republican Party is the main
danger facing working people, students, and the democratic middle classes. (This
should be increasingly obvious as Bush 2 begins to set back the peace and anti-war
movement 30 years by unilaterally withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty,
provoking Russia and China into a renewal of the arms race.)  Being that they are the
main danger they should be opposed independently where possible and in coalition with
the democratic party when necessary. Likewise the democratic party are no friend of
working people and it is our intention to build an independent movement. We will
oppose the democratic party where possible (like in New Brunswick) and unite with them
when there is a greater danger like in the upcoming gubernatorial election. This
should be our stated strategy.
     We must unequivocally cease the bourgeois politician's practice of being all
things to all people. If we alienate some people we will inspire many more. We are
supposed to be political leaders, which means we have to be in front not tailing
behind the most backward sections of the population trying to offend no one.
The essence of our principles of unity should be struggle for People's Democracy.
Defined as majority rule. We want participatory democracy not manufactured consent.
We must be uncompromising when it comes to principles.
    Also a final note as to fund raising since the only nominee for the open steering
committee seat believes that this is the most important issue. Money will come after
we do some good political work. No one is going to give us money to do good political
work. Instead of worrying about fundraising we should worry about build an
organization and a movement with a clear strategy and set of principles. The setting
of fundraising as an ends in itself is a continuation of the  "office community center
democracy clubhouse" line that was defeated both in theory and in practice.

&gt; &gt;Whose organization?  If you mean SWORD/BOL, get your own damn

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; U&amp;S is a collective organizer piece of propoganda, it would serve
&gt; &gt;the peoples' campaign tremendously.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It's a rag.  Most New Brunswick voters, i.e., the individuals whose
&gt; &gt;ballots will determine whether NBPC wins or not, either don't
&gt; &gt;understand it or are turned off by a lot of the virulent and
&gt; &gt;unreasoned writing in it.  How many subscriptions to U&amp;S do you sell
&gt; &gt;to New Brunswick voters?  If it were a dozen, I'd be surprised, and
&gt; &gt;we need 4000+ votes to win our 2002 electoral campaign.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; old relations and active organizations are something to be learned
&gt; &gt;from, these discussions are not only necessary and relevant, but they
&gt; &gt;have been being dissed for some time by your expulsion leaders.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Please specify which one of these old relations or active
&gt; &gt;organizations that you referred to has elected a candidate to

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; again about newark, the greens(fortuncookie) are in new brunswick
&gt; &gt;and will be working to elect schundler - the sooner a collective
&gt; &gt;strategy amongst local activists is put together the better. there is
&gt; &gt;no way that the greens should not be addressed, for you to argue such
&gt; &gt;only shows your own support for schundler.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What is fortuncookie?  Moreover, according to my information (i.e.
&gt; &gt;the ELEC website), the Greens' candidate for governor is Jerry L.
&gt; &gt;Coleman of Lawrenceville, not Schundler.  Personally, I back Jim
&gt; &gt;McGreevey so watch your mouth when you claim I support Schundler!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; in case you missed it the peoples' campaign has sabotaged its line
&gt; &gt;of community control with its sell out to republicans, where's your
&gt; &gt;arguements against this happening?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In case you missed it, the People's Campaign is about winning the
&gt; &gt;Democracy Ordinance through I&amp;R in 2001 and winning the mayor and two
&gt; &gt;council seats in 2002 with candidates to the liking of those who will
&gt; &gt;be in attendance at our Spring 2002 convention.  It's not about
&gt; &gt;struggle for its own sake, or about ideological purity.  It's about
&gt; &gt;winning seats in the New Brunswick city government.

Subject:struggle,splits,unity<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>In my opinion the folowing is a good analysis of why open ideological
struggle is fundamentally important.


The historical experience of proletarian parties, especially of the
Bolshevik Party and the Chinese Communist Party, shows that what is
involved in the disagreements that arise in such parties (even when the
differences seem to be concerned only with �shades of opinion�) is the
working out of a correct political line that can enable the working
class to conquer and then to consolidate its ideological and political
hegemony. In the long run, it is the proletarian character of the party
itself that is at issue. And this character can be lastingly maintained
only if the ideological unity of the party is based on the principles of
revolutionary Marxism, and if the party, in its functioning, respects
these principles, thus constituting a revolutionary vanguard supported
by the working masses.
     The ideological unity of a proletarian revolutionary party cannot
long survive mistakes in its political line: a party which over a long
period follows a non proletarian line must eventually be forced to deny
the principles it swears by, and lose the support of the advanced
elements of the proletariat and the masses. However, a wide discussion
aimed at drawing the lessons of the results practically achieved through
actually applying the political line is essential in order to determine
(especially when no previous experience is available) the more or the
less correct aspects of the line that has been followed, and the
rectifications the line requires in view of the experience acquired and
the changes that have occurred in the objective situation.
     This discussion is needed because there is no �recipe� stating a
priori that a certain measure or a certain slogan does or does not serve
the basic interests of the proletariat�except where obvious violations
of the principles of revolutionary Marxism are concerned. Only a
thorough study of reality, of practice, and of the contending theses
enables the party to decide correctly how to solve the problems posed by
the concrete elaboration of a correct line and by the practical
application of this line. Only respect for democratic
centralism�provided that democracy is its dominant aspect�can enable
those who, though they uphold correct conceptions, are in the minority,
to make themselves heard, if they themselves dare to �go against the
tide.�
      A given political line is proletarian in character only if it does
not violate the principles of revolutionary Marxism: but it must also
correspond effectively to the needs of the actual situation, thus making
it possible to deal correctly�from the standpoint of the
proletariat�with the principal contradiction in the particular situation
prevailing, and with the secondary contradictions which are subordinate
to this one.  In a situation which is evolving quickly, a political line
or slogan that was correct at a particular moment may become wrong quite
soon afterward. For example, the slogan �All Power to the Soviets� was a
correct slogan from February 27 until July 4, 1917, in a period when
armed counter-revolution presented no threat. It ceased to be correct
after July 4 when, as Lenin wrote, �the counter-revolutionary
bourgeoisie, working hand in glove with the monarchists and the Black
Hundreds, secured the support of the petty-bourgeois
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, partly by intimidating them,
and handed over real power to the Cavaignacs, the military gang�[24]
      What applies to a particular slogan or measure applies also to the
concrete political line of a party. This line can be revolutionary and
proletarian only if it corresponds to the needs of the actual situation.
Accordingly, when the situation changes�when, for example, a period of
civil war gives way to a period of peaceful construction�appropriate
changes have to be made in the party line, in the measures the party
takes, and in the slogans it issues.  In order to cope with the demands
facing it, a proletarian party must be able to recognize and rectify in
good time the mistakes it has made.
      A revolutionary party can make mistakes, even serious ones,
without losing its proletarian character, but it loses this character
when it becomes lastingly incapable of recognizing that it has made a
mistake, and of correcting its political line accordingly. The process
of recognizing and rectifying mistakes can develop fully only under
conditions of sufficiently open ideological struggle: without such a
struggle it becomes more and more difficult to work out and apply a
proletarian line, and, in the long run, to preserve the party�s
proletarian character�and also, consequently, if the party is in power,
the proletarian character of the state.
    When, in a proletarian party, several political lines are in
conflict, all of which seem to correspond to the needs of the
revolution, it is only by applying theoretical analysis and concrete
analysis (and so, also, by critically examining past and present
practice) that it becomes possible to decide which of these lines really
best serves the interests of the proletariat. Open discussion, criticism
and self-criticism are thus of very great importance. They make it
possible to carry out analyses which are as thorough as possible, to
appreciate the significance of all the shades of difference, to draw up
a detailed balance sheet, and to deduce lessons from past mistakes, and
thus to rectify past errors.
     As long as social classes exist, the class struggle going on in
society is reflected in the party in the form of ideological and
political struggle. The proletarian line, the one which in the given
situation is best calculated to serve the interests of the proletariat,
is therefore inevitably confronted by a bourgeois line. The latter is
the one which, in the given conditions, serves best the interests of the
bourgeoisie. In relation to the bourgeois and proletarian lines, the
other lines represent right or �left� opportunist orientations. In
circumstances where it corresponds better to the interests of the
bourgeoisie, an opportunist line may become a bourgeois line. At a given
moment, the existence of a definite bourgeois line conceals the
bourgeois content of a particular opportunist tendency, which thus seems
to �blend� with the proletarian line, but will at a later stage come
into open conflict with the latter.
      A correct ideological struggle requires that at each moment the
principal target must be the bourgeois line, without losing sight of the
opportunist tendency. Thus, in November-December 1920, Lenin�s principal
target was the Trotsky-Bukharin opposition: then, when that trend had
been practically beaten, he took as his principal target the Workers�
Opposition. There is no �recipe� for �spotting at first glance� the
bourgeois line of the moment. It is often a line which seems to be
particularly �close� to the revolutionary line, for it is in this way
that a great number of party members can be more easily misled. It may
seem merely to take revolutionary orientations to their �logical
conclusion.� Only when its true class character has been exposed does
the bourgeois line cease to seem �close� to the revolutionary line: but
its place is then inevitably taken by another tendency which, in turn,
seems to �blend� with (or be �indistinguishable from�) the revolutionary
line.  Those who defend a bourgeois line are, objectively,
representatives of the bourgeoisie inside the proletarian party, but
this does not imply that they are its �conscious agents.� One has,
therefore, to start from the assumption that they (and, a fortiori,
those who have merely been influenced by a nonproletarian line) can be
won over to the proletarian line: this is why it is important to �leave
a way out� for those who oppose the proletarian line, provided that they
are not splitting the party and are not playing a double game.
     It is clear, and experience confirms this, that there is no
�guarantee� that a proletarian party will always, at every moment, rally
round the line which is correct from the standpoint of the interests of
the proletariat, the revolutionary line. The definition of the
proletarian revolutionary line can therefore not be left to a mere
�majority vote,� whether in a popular (or workers�) assembly, in a party
congress, or in a meeting of the party�s Central Committee. Experience
shows that, faced with a profoundly new situation, it is usually only a
minority that finds the correct path, even in an experienced proletarian
party. This being so, to suppose that a majority vote can settle
difficulties and decide the correct line would be quite illusory.
Generally speaking, what is correct does not immediately appear as such:
this clarification comes about only after struggle, free discussion,
experience, and the test of time.
     In order that what is new and true may make its way in the world
without too much difficulty, there must be no claiming that what is true
and what is false can be decided by the simplistic method of voting,
when what is involved calls for analysis and discussion. (This does not
rule out the possibility that, where immediate practical decisions are
required, it may be necessary to resort to voting before a problem has
been studied in all its aspects.)  It was not accidental that Lenin was
more than once beaten when votes were taken in the Bolshevik party at
crucial moments, so that he had to �go against the tide.� Mao Tse tung
has stressed that �going against the tide is a Marxist-Leninist
principle.�[25] It is therefore essential that new revolutionary ideas
be given the possibility of being defended, and that those who are the
bearers of these ideas possess the right, and the courage, to defend
them.
The problem of what is true and what is false as regards the conditions
for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat is all the more
difficult to settle because the practice of proletarian rule is
historically in its infancy, as compared with the thousands of years of
experience of rule possessed by the exploiting classes. This is also why
what might have seemed obvious fifty years ago, and which was indeed so
on the basis of experience up to that time and the corresponding
development of theory, may seem today only partly true. Every scientific
truth is capable of developing and getting enriched, thereby becoming a
new truth through the shedding of what, in the �former truth� was really
false.  If the presence within a proletarian party of a majority
favorable to a particular political line, or to certain measures, does
not �guarantee� the proletarian character of this line or these
measures, it is nonetheless necessary, when the moment comes to act and
when the highest party bodies have declared for them, that the minority
submit in action, even while reserving their own opinion so as to be
better able subsequently to correct mistakes. It is only if there are
profound divergences, and if there is no other way to correct the party
orientation, that a split is to be preferred to unity and in this case,
it is those who are violating party principles who bear responsibility
for the split. Naturally, the possibility of correcting mistakes of
orientation becomes more restricted when these mistakes do not emerge
openly but only in the form of a certain practice, that is of an
undeclared opposition

Flavio,

I have no objection to the decesion taken at the June meeting with regard to teh
democracy ordiance the mayor's race and the Schundler camapign.
I just think that the proposal that was passed is not sufficent for principles of
unity. I don't think that it has any strategy for building a movement.
I am only against it to the extent that it is meant to take the place of long term
political goals of building a movemnt for real democracy which in my opinuion is
majority rule.
I put forward my arguement in a piece I just recently e-mailed called "what to do". I
certainly would like toknow what you think of it.

Take Care
Keith

&gt;
&gt; Keith, as to your other discussion about principles of unity, what
&gt; are your objections (other than your mere disagreement with them) to
&gt; the "goals," "purposes," "principles of unity" - call them what you
&gt; will - adopted at the June meeting, specifically, winning the Pro-
&gt; Democracy Ordinance in 2001 and the mayor and 2 city council seats in
&gt; 2002?  The membership has spoken and I'm not sure what has changed to
&gt; warrant us reconsidering those two guiding principles.  The
&gt; membership has also spoken that opposing Bret Schundler is a means of
&gt; implementing those principles.  I presume you don't want that aspect
&gt; of implementing the goals/purposes/principles changed as well?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; as long as BOL/SWORD are granted immediate access... and all known

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I also wanted to say that I don't think that people need to
&gt; explain why
&gt; &gt; &gt;they voted the way they did. People have a right to their opinion
&gt; as well
&gt; &gt; &gt;as their vote.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; if people don't want to hear it that's fine with me. flavier says
&gt; i'm
&gt; &gt; against democracy, he'll have to explain it somehow.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I am hoping that ending the policy of excluding sword will lead to
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt;renewed campaign not more intensive name calling and accusations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; keith if you cannot sense that there is a large sectarian bloc
&gt; leading the
&gt; &gt; charge against SWORD organizing within the nbpc then i don't know
&gt; what to
&gt; &gt; tell you. i will organize open and above board, i will not conspire.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I think that the main tasks before The People's Camapign are until
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;November
&gt; &gt; &gt;election are:
&gt; &gt; &gt;1. the defeat of Shundler
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; we should begin immediate work on a voter registration/education
&gt; campaign.
&gt; &gt; many organizations throughout the state can be contacted to
&gt; participate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;2. cricticism/summation of past elctorial effort that concludes in
&gt; &gt; &gt;re-orientation and rectification with a set of POU's and renewed
&gt; vow to the
&gt; &gt; &gt;local platform and the inclusion of a national platform or at
&gt; least a
&gt; &gt; &gt;committment to developing one. In my opinion the Campaign without
&gt; POU's and
&gt; &gt; &gt;a commitment to the platform is just chasing ambulances rather
&gt; than
&gt; &gt; &gt;building a movement.  I already sent out this piece below but I am
&gt; sending
&gt; &gt; &gt;it again. I am hoping that we can build some unity around it. I
&gt; think that
&gt; &gt; &gt;it can serve as the begining for a rectification and reorientation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i would suggest that until this is finely organized that we should
&gt; draft our
&gt; &gt; positions and present them at the general meetings. my criticism
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; summation will be known and i would encourage all members to make
&gt; an effort
&gt; &gt; to draft their own.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;What to do?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;      Since the February meeting the People's Campaign has become
&gt; &gt; &gt;increasing
&gt; &gt; &gt;disoriented and isolated from any base whatsoever. The meetings
&gt; following
&gt; &gt; &gt;February
&gt; &gt; &gt;have been characterized by petty intrigues, petty debates about
&gt; &gt; &gt;organizational
&gt; &gt; &gt;structure, expulsions, and a general crisis of identity. I think
&gt; this state
&gt; &gt; &gt;is
&gt; &gt; &gt;recognized by most but few are clear enough or willing enough to
&gt; admit it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;This state
&gt; &gt; &gt;of affairs has come about because of a bad strategy that was
&gt; initiated at
&gt; &gt; &gt;the founding
&gt; &gt; &gt;meeting of the campaign in January of 2000. The strategy that was
&gt; put into
&gt; &gt; &gt;motion at
&gt; &gt; &gt;said meeting was a united front against local the democratic
&gt; party. This
&gt; &gt; &gt;strategy saw
&gt; &gt; &gt;the local democratic party as the main target and then sought
&gt; allies on
&gt; &gt; &gt;that basis
&gt; &gt; &gt;leading us to ally ourselves with republicans among others. Our
&gt; out look
&gt; &gt; &gt;was short
&gt; &gt; &gt;sighted, narrow and parochial.
&gt; &gt; &gt;      Instead of strategizing to build a movement over the long
&gt; term we
&gt; &gt; &gt;thought only in
&gt; &gt; &gt;terms of the upcoming election. This is a recipe for failure and
&gt; has put us
&gt; &gt; &gt;in the
&gt; &gt; &gt;position we are in today. It has confused the organization and
&gt; those
&gt; &gt; &gt;associated with
&gt; &gt; &gt;it to the point of paralysis. The last meetings resolution to have
&gt; two main
&gt; &gt; &gt;objectives
&gt; &gt; &gt;for the campaign (democracy ordinance and mayor's election 2000)
&gt; is just
&gt; &gt; &gt;more
&gt; &gt; &gt;wandering in the wilderness.
&gt; &gt; &gt;      What we need is a ground up re-organization that begins with
&gt; a sum up
&gt; &gt; &gt;of our
&gt; &gt; &gt;success and failures in our last attempt. This must include a
&gt; critique of
&gt; &gt; &gt;the faulty
&gt; &gt; &gt;strategy that I already mentioned and include a new orientation.
&gt; The new
&gt; &gt; &gt;orientation
&gt; &gt; &gt;should begin with a strategy that states clearly that the
&gt; Republican Party
&gt; &gt; &gt;is the main
&gt; &gt; &gt;danger facing working people, students, and the democratic middle
&gt; classes.
&gt; &gt; &gt;(This
&gt; &gt; &gt;should be increasingly obvious as Bush 2 begins to set back the
&gt; peace and
&gt; &gt; &gt;anti-war
&gt; &gt; &gt;movement 30 years by unilaterally withdrawing from the Anti-
&gt; Ballistic
&gt; &gt; &gt;Missile treaty,
&gt; &gt; &gt;provoking Russia and China into a renewal of the arms race.)
&gt; Being that
&gt; &gt; &gt;they are the
&gt; &gt; &gt;main danger they should be opposed independently where possible
&gt; and in
&gt; &gt; &gt;coalition with
&gt; &gt; &gt;the democratic party when necessary. Likewise the democratic party
&gt; are no
&gt; &gt; &gt;friend of
&gt; &gt; &gt;working people and it is our intention to build an independent
&gt; movement. We
&gt; &gt; &gt;will
&gt; &gt; &gt;oppose the democratic party where possible (like in New Brunswick)
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt;unite with them
&gt; &gt; &gt;when there is a greater danger like in the upcoming gubernatorial
&gt; election.
&gt; &gt; &gt;This
&gt; &gt; &gt;should be our stated strategy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;      We must unequivocally cease the bourgeois politician's
&gt; practice of
&gt; &gt; &gt;being all
&gt; &gt; &gt;things to all people. If we alienate some people we will inspire
&gt; many more.
&gt; &gt; &gt;We are
&gt; &gt; &gt;supposed to be political leaders, which means we have to be in
&gt; front not
&gt; &gt; &gt;tailing
&gt; &gt; &gt;behind the most backward sections of the population trying to
&gt; offend no
&gt; &gt; &gt;one.
&gt; &gt; &gt;The essence of our principles of unity should be struggle for
&gt; People's
&gt; &gt; &gt;Democracy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Defined as majority rule. We want participatory democracy not
&gt; manufactured
&gt; &gt; &gt;consent.
&gt; &gt; &gt;We must be uncompromising when it comes to principles.
&gt; &gt; &gt;     Also a final note as to fund raising since the only nominee
&gt; for the
&gt; &gt; &gt;open steering
&gt; &gt; &gt;committee seat believes that this is the most important issue.
&gt; Money will
&gt; &gt; &gt;come after
&gt; &gt; &gt;we do some good political work. No one is going to give us money
&gt; to do good
&gt; &gt; &gt;political
&gt; &gt; &gt;work. Instead of worrying about fundraising we should worry about
&gt; build an
&gt; &gt; &gt;organization and a movement with a clear strategy and set of
&gt; principles.
&gt; &gt; &gt;The setting
&gt; &gt; &gt;of fundraising as an ends in itself is a continuation of
&gt; the  "office
&gt; &gt; &gt;community center
&gt; &gt; &gt;democracy clubhouse" line that was defeated both in theory and in
&gt; practice.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if we win newark in may 2002 is our organization more

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; U&amp;S is a collective organizer piece of propoganda, it would

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the peoples' campaign tremendously.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;It's a rag.  Most New Brunswick voters, i.e., the individuals
&gt; whose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ballots will determine whether NBPC wins or not, either don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;understand it or are turned off by a lot of the virulent and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;unreasoned writing in it.  How many subscriptions to U&amp;S do
&gt; you sell
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to New Brunswick voters?  If it were a dozen, I'd be
&gt; surprised, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we need 4000+ votes to win our 2002 electoral campaign.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; old relations and active organizations are something to be
&gt; learned
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from, these discussions are not only necessary and relevant,
&gt; but they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have been being dissed for some time by your expulsion leaders.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Please specify which one of these old relations or active
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;organizations that you referred to has elected a candidate to

&gt; there is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;no way that the greens should not be addressed, for you to

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;only shows your own support for schundler.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;What is fortuncookie?  Moreover, according to my information
&gt; (i.e.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the ELEC website), the Greens' candidate for governor is Jerry

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Coleman of Lawrenceville, not Schundler.  Personally, I back
&gt; Jim
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;McGreevey so watch your mouth when you claim I support
&gt; Schundler!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in case you missed it the peoples' campaign has sabotaged

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;In case you missed it, the People's Campaign is about winning
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Democracy Ordinance through I&amp;R in 2001 and winning the mayor
&gt; and two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;council seats in 2002 with candidates to the liking of those
&gt; who will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be in attendance at our Spring 2002 convention.  It's not about

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Jeremy,
One of the reason that I posted the piece you mentioned was that I think that the
campaign has a tendency towards "manufacturing consent" rather than participatory
democracy. Though I wouldn't advocate it for the campaign the ideal of democractic
centralism is that thorough going discussion proceeds decisions and are followed by
unity of action even by dissenters who are not only allowed but encouraged to continue
to raise their dissent in the future. This is ideal for a revolutionary organziation
because it allows unity of action in bloc. But as I said democratic centralism is not
appropriate for the campaign.

Anyway as to this debate, I don't think that the vote last saturday was a perfect
expression of the public will or even democratic principles, however it was a perfect
expression of the form of democrcay that has come to dominate in the People's
Campaign. If one of the results of that decision is a more serious consideration of
what it means to function democratically I would be very happy.

I also feel that the whole issue of democracy within the campaign is being raised at
this time because it is the first time that a certain clique has lost a vote.
Unfortunately this discussion was not happening prior to the latest decision. I think
that the principles that you outlined below would be a fine place to start.

As an ideological aside I think that the liberal idea of democracy is exactly what
Chomsky called "manufacturing consent" the idea of a participatory democracy is
outside of the liberal conception. For the liberal the point of democracy is to be
able to pursue private interests (usually involving some exploiattion) while what I
think that what we want from a working class standpoint or radical democratic if you
prefer is mass participation and an enlargement of the public sphere and public
control resting on the assumption that human beings are social animals and that
co-operation is essential to our survival if we want to live without exploitation,
coercion and oppression.

Since you weren't at the meeting I will add, that I argued to end the expulsion of
sword. I don't agree that what we now need is an interegation of why people voted the
way they did. I understand why people voted the way they did and that is their right.
But to explain my own actions, firstly I opposse on principle the policy of expelling
leftist even if they are ultra-leftist. I think that this was done much to flippantly
in the first place. It is not the practice of Lenin or Mao (not that you care in
particular, but for the record) who worked with Trotsky and the gang of four
respectively even while criticizing them. I won't make a dogma out of it but generally
speaking there should be extraordinary circumstances. I also find it odd that we would
work with republicans and not sword.

A second reason is that there is a very distinct right trend that has emerged in the
campaign. Part of that trend I already mentioned as far as the discussion of
democrcay, some other aspects are the trading of political work for social service (ie
office space club house whatever), the narrowing of the struggle to its the most
parochial features, the repeated attempts to suppress discussion and debate, the
belittling of theory, the refusal to be self-critical etc.

In my opinion these are right wing mistakes that need to be corrected in order to move
forward, I think that sword will be allies in that struggle.

There already exists some kind of code of conduct, if people feel the need to expound
it and include basic things like an end to  profanity and name calling in place of
polemic and discussion, though it seems profoundly childish that we need such things
but I guess practice has proven that we do, I would support that.

I am opposed to explusions that are motivated by desire for personal power or stifling
dissent or eliminating a political line that someone may not agree with but does not
violate our principles of unity or our platform(a note for the slow: the republicans
oppose our platform).

While some members of sword have not been the most reasonable people and often tended
to revert to school yard antics like name calling and profainity, I think that those
tendencies can be criticized and eliminated without expelling the organization.

&gt; Joe,
&gt;
&gt; Allow me to reframe the problem slightly in terms of general
&gt; principles.  I tried to incorporate your notion of the 'will of the
&gt; public' into the message ...
&gt;
&gt; When I spoke of "liberal democratic norms" below, I did not mean
&gt; something like "neoliberal economic values" or "the full set of
&gt; values typically embraced by centrist liberals".  I was merely
&gt; referring certain very, very basic liberal norms.  The following is a
&gt; cursory list, but it covers most of the bases :
&gt;
&gt; 1)  An emphasis on procedures that ensure fair and open debate, and
&gt; guarantee room for productive dissent.  (If you look at the piece
&gt; Keith posted up, you'll see that even an 'old-school' Marxist-
&gt; Leninist would agree to some extent).
&gt;
&gt; 2)  An acceptance of the values of precedent and continuity.  A
&gt; course of action, a vote, a set of rules that were previously adopted
&gt; by democratic means ought to be abandoned only with much reservation
&gt; and extensive deliberation.
&gt;
&gt; 3)  The idea that people are to be judged, as far as the organization
&gt; officially cares, by their arguments and their actions, and not by
&gt; their beliefs, worldview, or their self-proclaimed ideology.  The
&gt; flipside of this is that one has a duty not to make one's arguments
&gt; _entirely_ bound to professions of faith in this or that religion or
&gt; ideology.
&gt;
&gt; 4)  A limited, critical view of voting.  A vote is a technique that
&gt; can be employed in many different contexts, democratic and
&gt; undemocratic.  #1, 2 and 3 above provide the framework under which a
&gt; democratic vote can exist.
&gt;
&gt; 5)  An effective recognition that the 'will of the public' is
&gt; meaningless outside of certain boundaries.  Those boundaries include
&gt; the actions of an elected leadership, and previous acts of the 'will
&gt; of the public' (see #2).
&gt;
&gt; An additional note of commentary:
&gt;
&gt; a)  You'll note that these are largely the alleged norms of anything
&gt; that tries to call itself 'democratic' in a liberal sense, including
&gt; a city council in New Jersey.  Precisely because of this, they are
&gt; not only necessary to guide the internal affairs of a reform-minded
&gt; organization.  They also are necessary if one is going to try to
&gt; argue that, for example, an allegedly 'democratically elected' city
&gt; council is truly undemocratic, or that its legislation is
&gt; undemocratic.
&gt;
&gt; b)  You'll observe that #3 has an implicit function.  It serves to
&gt; attempt to keep people speaking largely the same 'language'.  Not
&gt; everyone can communicate ideas through Biblical references, through
&gt; references to ancient Roman history, through Marxist jargon, through
&gt; the terms of this or that philosopher, and so forth.  But most people
&gt; can in some capacity speak the language of (American) liberal
&gt; politics.
&gt;
&gt; I can't think of much else to say on the matter.  If you want
&gt; elaboration on a certain point, or care to rationally debate a
&gt; certain point, I will happily respond.  Otherwise, I will presume the
&gt; conversation to be over.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Flavio,

I support the idea that the campaign be focused on electoral politics. An office for
that is fine though that was not what was voted on at the campaign meeting. It was the
peoples community center for democrac or some such thing. An office with a phone and
photocopier is something else though neither should be put before political work.

I think we also agree that the vote to re-admit sword happened in the same fashion as
very other vote in the campaign.
(you are wrong about eligibility by campaign rules)

But it is interesting that this vote would cause so much discussion about procedure
and little about anything else. Procedure is not suppossed to be a battering ram to
eleimnate political ideas or votes thatyou don't agree with.

I think that the vote on the "community cenetr" was a classic example of manufactured
consent. Some 50 people voted in favor of it never to be heard from again.
how would you explain that.

As far as winning the election in 2002. I think that Joe is right win he says get rid
of the right wing work in the community.
The people of New Brunswick are instinctively anti-republican (and their instincts are
correct) regardless of how many people like Frank Bright.  When we unite with
republicans we give the appearance that we are attacking the local democrats from the
right rather than the left. This was fatal in November 2000 and will be fatal in 2002
if it is not corrected.

Our commitment to electoral politics should look like this. Always opposse
republicans. opposse democrats were we can win, support them when we can't and there
is a greater danger, and work to end the domination of two parties in favor of a
multi-party system.

This is simple and would win us broad support and once we showed its effectiveness in
practice it will be easy to raise money for office space.

It is the only winning strategy for 2002.

The reason for all the confusion and commotion is that we can not have a broad
discussion of this question to re-order the camapaign on the footing the I set forth
above. So we inch foward with band aid solutions. My advocacy of purging the
republicans and re-admitting Sword stems from the desire to put the campign on the
footing stated above.

That is the only winning strategy for 2002.

&gt; "Manufacturing" consent!?!?!  Now that's nonsense.  How the Campaign
&gt; decides on things is not complicated.  You make a proposal ... in
&gt; writing and in advance is the desirable way, so people can discuss
&gt; and think about it if possible.  You get it on the agenda.  It gets
&gt; discussed in the business meeting and voted on, up, down, or with
&gt; amendments.  Nothing precludes other meetings / discussion circles /
&gt; whatever from being formed to formulate ideas, attack proposals, etc.
&gt;
&gt; As an example: the proposal that the Campaign's focus be electoral
&gt; wins, approved at the June meeting.  It was written up, posted on the
&gt; egroup, discussed at the meeting, and approved.  Anyone who felt that
&gt; the Campaign's goals ought to be something other than electoral wins,
&gt; was free to vote down the proposal.  A majority felt otherwise.
&gt; Nothing manufactured there.
&gt;
&gt; Nor, strictly speaking, was anything "manufactured" by the admittedly
&gt; disappointing vote to readmit SWORD.  (reserving judgment on the
&gt; qualifications of some voters for the time being).  Mass
&gt; participation in our meetings is expressly provided for in our
&gt; procedures.  That SWORD's faction won can be more attributed to
&gt; community members' failure to attend our meetings, not a lack of
&gt; democratic procedure within the Campaign.
&gt;
&gt; Also, FYI, to my knowledge, the People's Campaign Center plan has not
&gt; been repealed.  To the contrary, I think that most people recognize
&gt; that an organization like ours, whose goals are to win two defined
&gt; electoral campaigns, needs a physical headquarters.  Thus, just like
&gt; the opposition to Schundler is a MEANS of accomplishing our GOAL of
&gt; electoral wins, so too is the People's Campaign Center a MEANS of
&gt; accomplishing those GOALS.  That some of the people who were leading
&gt; the People's Campaign Center committee have not followed through on
&gt; their assigned tasks is unfortunate as well but I do not equate that
&gt; with abandonment of the proposal.
&gt;
&gt; One last comment: I do not belittle the need to study theory and
&gt; history.  I would like to hear some theoretical and historical
&gt; analysis of how we clean the machine's clock in 2001 and 2002, not
&gt; the value of Bettleheim.

&gt; &gt; Jeremy,
&gt; &gt; One of the reason that I posted the piece you mentioned was that I
&gt; think that the
&gt; &gt; campaign has a tendency towards "manufacturing consent" rather than
&gt; participatory
&gt; &gt; democracy. Though I wouldn't advocate it for the campaign the ideal
&gt; of democractic
&gt; &gt; centralism is that thorough going discussion proceeds decisions and
&gt; are followed by
&gt; &gt; unity of action even by dissenters who are not only allowed but
&gt; encouraged to continue
&gt; &gt; to raise their dissent in the future. This is ideal for a
&gt; revolutionary organziation
&gt; &gt; because it allows unity of action in bloc. But as I said democratic
&gt; centralism is not
&gt; &gt; appropriate for the campaign.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway as to this debate, I don't think that the vote last saturday
&gt; was a perfect
&gt; &gt; expression of the public will or even democratic principles,
&gt; however it was a perfect
&gt; &gt; expression of the form of democrcay that has come to dominate in
&gt; the People's
&gt; &gt; Campaign. If one of the results of that decision is a more serious
&gt; consideration of
&gt; &gt; what it means to function democratically I would be very happy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I also feel that the whole issue of democracy within the campaign
&gt; is being raised at
&gt; &gt; this time because it is the first time that a certain clique has
&gt; lost a vote.
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately this discussion was not happening prior to the latest
&gt; decision. I think
&gt; &gt; that the principles that you outlined below would be a fine place
&gt; to start.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As an ideological aside I think that the liberal idea of democracy
&gt; is exactly what
&gt; &gt; Chomsky called "manufacturing consent" the idea of a participatory
&gt; democracy is
&gt; &gt; outside of the liberal conception. For the liberal the point of
&gt; democracy is to be
&gt; &gt; able to pursue private interests (usually involving some
&gt; exploiattion) while what I
&gt; &gt; think that what we want from a working class standpoint or radical
&gt; democratic if you
&gt; &gt; prefer is mass participation and an enlargement of the public
&gt; sphere and public
&gt; &gt; control resting on the assumption that human beings are social
&gt; animals and that
&gt; &gt; co-operation is essential to our survival if we want to live
&gt; without exploitation,
&gt; &gt; coercion and oppression.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Since you weren't at the meeting I will add, that I argued to end
&gt; the expulsion of
&gt; &gt; sword. I don't agree that what we now need is an interegation of
&gt; why people voted the
&gt; &gt; way they did. I understand why people voted the way they did and
&gt; that is their right.
&gt; &gt; But to explain my own actions, firstly I opposse on principle the
&gt; policy of expelling
&gt; &gt; leftist even if they are ultra-leftist. I think that this was done
&gt; much to flippantly
&gt; &gt; in the first place. It is not the practice of Lenin or Mao (not
&gt; that you care in
&gt; &gt; particular, but for the record) who worked with Trotsky and the
&gt; gang of four
&gt; &gt; respectively even while criticizing them. I won't make a dogma out
&gt; of it but generally
&gt; &gt; speaking there should be extraordinary circumstances. I also find
&gt; it odd that we would
&gt; &gt; work with republicans and not sword.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A second reason is that there is a very distinct right trend that
&gt; has emerged in the
&gt; &gt; campaign. Part of that trend I already mentioned as far as the
&gt; discussion of
&gt; &gt; democrcay, some other aspects are the trading of political work for
&gt; social service (ie
&gt; &gt; office space club house whatever), the narrowing of the struggle to
&gt; its the most
&gt; &gt; parochial features, the repeated attempts to suppress discussion
&gt; and debate, the
&gt; &gt; belittling of theory, the refusal to be self-critical etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In my opinion these are right wing mistakes that need to be
&gt; corrected in order to move
&gt; &gt; forward, I think that sword will be allies in that struggle.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There already exists some kind of code of conduct, if people feel
&gt; the need to expound
&gt; &gt; it and include basic things like an end to  profanity and name
&gt; calling in place of
&gt; &gt; polemic and discussion, though it seems profoundly childish that we
&gt; need such things
&gt; &gt; but I guess practice has proven that we do, I would support that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am opposed to explusions that are motivated by desire for
&gt; personal power or stifling
&gt; &gt; dissent or eliminating a political line that someone may not agree
&gt; with but does not
&gt; &gt; violate our principles of unity or our platform(a note for the
&gt; slow: the republicans
&gt; &gt; oppose our platform).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; While some members of sword have not been the most reasonable
&gt; people and often tended
&gt; &gt; to revert to school yard antics like name calling and profainity, I
&gt; think that those
&gt; &gt; tendencies can be criticized and eliminated without expelling the
&gt; organization.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Joe,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Allow me to reframe the problem slightly in terms of general
&gt; &gt; &gt; principles.  I tried to incorporate your notion of the 'will of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; public' into the message ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; When I spoke of "liberal democratic norms" below, I did not mean
&gt; &gt; &gt; something like "neoliberal economic values" or "the full set of
&gt; &gt; &gt; values typically embraced by centrist liberals".  I was merely
&gt; &gt; &gt; referring certain very, very basic liberal norms.  The following
&gt; is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; cursory list, but it covers most of the bases :
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)  An emphasis on procedures that ensure fair and open debate,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee room for productive dissent.  (If you look at the piece
&gt; &gt; &gt; Keith posted up, you'll see that even an 'old-school' Marxist-
&gt; &gt; &gt; Leninist would agree to some extent).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2)  An acceptance of the values of precedent and continuity.  A
&gt; &gt; &gt; course of action, a vote, a set of rules that were previously
&gt; adopted
&gt; &gt; &gt; by democratic means ought to be abandoned only with much
&gt; reservation
&gt; &gt; &gt; and extensive deliberation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3)  The idea that people are to be judged, as far as the
&gt; organization
&gt; &gt; &gt; officially cares, by their arguments and their actions, and not by
&gt; &gt; &gt; their beliefs, worldview, or their self-proclaimed ideology.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; flipside of this is that one has a duty not to make one's
&gt; arguments
&gt; &gt; &gt; _entirely_ bound to professions of faith in this or that religion
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt; ideology.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4)  A limited, critical view of voting.  A vote is a technique
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be employed in many different contexts, democratic and
&gt; &gt; &gt; undemocratic.  #1, 2 and 3 above provide the framework under
&gt; which a
&gt; &gt; &gt; democratic vote can exist.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5)  An effective recognition that the 'will of the public' is
&gt; &gt; &gt; meaningless outside of certain boundaries.  Those boundaries
&gt; include
&gt; &gt; &gt; the actions of an elected leadership, and previous acts of

<pre>Two points,
first, Cliff is correct that the decision to expel sword took place in a steering
committee meeting.

Secondly, the vote was 8 to 5  to adopt the purpose that you list below. Out of the
eight, 3 were Tracy Ford's kids (who are how old? and have done what?) and on top of
those three, one was Ford himself and the other was Bright.

What's good for the goose is good for the gander. But, maybe we should admit that the
current attempts at democracy in the campaign leave something to be desired. And agree
to come up with a better framework.

&gt; through surveying and a vote at a people's convention."
&gt;
&gt; Therefore, electoral wins are in fact the per se goal of the

Subject:Attacking Anarchist?<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Joe,
Your flyer compares anarchists to the terrorists that attacked the WTC. That is not
only stupid it alienates everyone that you were working with. How can that be
productive? It is best to criticize people's actions not what they say. If the
anarchists do something that I think is wrong I will criticize it. Anarchists are
leading the "anti-globilization movement", they are fighting a significant aspect of
imperialism, to just dismiss that is arrogant and ignorant, if you think that only
local struggle is of importnace you are certainly not a Marxist, see Marx and Engels
on 1st International see Lenin What is to be done. see Ho Chi Min see Mao Zedong, see
Malcom X.
It was a mistake to compare anarchists with terrorists.
You have isolated yourself from the bulk of young organizers already. Persisting in
this way will only isolate you more, it has nothing to do with me. Though I will
continue to draw a line of demarcation between SWORD and Unity &amp; Struggle. We have
many disagreements.
We are facing a very dangerous situation and there is certainly the potential that
Bush led Imperialism will push the world towards fascism. Your line is the same as the
Trots who attcked the Communists from within the United Front in Spain opening the way
for Franco. Before you deny it, try learning about it. Practice your line if you want.
Don't blame me for your failure isolation.

PS. This is the only response that I will make to  this point on e-mail. We don't have
time.

&gt; it is an outright lie that the anarchists are leading the struggle against
&gt; imperialism! The majority of protestors at these conferences are not even
&gt; anarchists - let alone those that understand to organize their international
&gt; revolutionary line locally throughout the community, such as the elected
&gt; school board campaign and ras baraka for newark council. the peoples local
&gt; and community organization against imperialism is 1000X more productive than
&gt; a one day or weak protest. the ruling class has already won the street war -
&gt; didn't marx say that over 100 years ago? that we should organize locally to
&gt; seize political office, isn't that what Unity &amp; Struggle has authored?
&gt;
&gt; everywhere keith goes he joins the strongest tide within "the movement"
&gt; against the now members of SWORD
&gt;
&gt; in a united front the people &amp; organizations come together but our
&gt; tendencies do not cease. that is why we must embrace debates and criticisms
&gt; - we are willing to prove our case. to agree and state that i cannot
&gt; criticize a member of the anti-war movement, which is what those that
&gt; initially disagreed with paragraph 3 stated, is wrong and hazardous to Unity

&gt;  &gt; THE POP LIFE
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; After the Horror, Radio Stations Pull Some Songs
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; By NEIL STRAUSS
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Clear Channel Communications, the Texas-based company that owns about
&gt;  &gt; 1,170 radio stations nationwide, has circulated a list of 150 songs
&gt;  &gt; and asked its stations to avoid playing them because of the attacks
&gt;  &gt; on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Some listed songs would be insensitive to play right now, such as the
&gt;  &gt; Gap Band's "You Dropped a Bomb on Me" and Soundgarden's "Blow Up the
&gt;  &gt; Outside World," but other choices, critics and musicians say, are
&gt;  &gt; less explicable because they have little literal connection to the
&gt;  &gt; tragedies.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; These include "Ticket to Ride" by the Beatles, "On Broadway" by the
&gt;  &gt; Drifters and "Bennie and the Jets" by Elton John. Even odder, some
&gt;  &gt; songs on the list are patriotic, like Neil Diamond's "America."
&gt;  &gt; Others speak of universal optimism, like Louis Armstrong's "What a
&gt;  &gt; Wonderful World," and others are emotional but hopeful songs that
&gt;  &gt; could help people grieve, like "Imagine" by John Lennon, "Bridge Over
&gt;  &gt; Troubled Water" by Simon and Garfunkel, "Peace Train" by Cat Stevens
&gt;  &gt; and "A World Without Love" by Peter and Gordon.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; The move by Clear Channel, whose collective broadcasts reach more
&gt;  &gt; than 110 million listeners in the nation weekly, was voluntary. Many
&gt;  &gt; stations, including some in the New York area, said they were
&gt;  &gt; disregarding the list, which was distributed internally.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Another Peter and Gordon song, "I Go to Pieces," made the list. "I
&gt;  &gt; suppose a song about someone going to pieces could be upsetting if
&gt;  &gt; someone took it literally," said Peter Asher of Peter and Gordon
&gt;  &gt; after learning that the group's two songs were on the list. "But 'I
&gt;  &gt; can't live in a world without love' is a sentiment that's as true in
&gt;  &gt; crisis as it is in normal times. It's a totally pro-love sentiment
&gt;  &gt; and could only be helpful right now."
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; A Clear Channel spokeswoman emphasized that the list was not a
&gt;  &gt; mandate or order to radio programmers. In a statement, the company
&gt;  &gt; said the list came not from the corporate offices but from "a
&gt;  &gt; grass-roots effort that was apparently circulated among program
&gt;  &gt; directors."
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Others in the Clear Channel network, speaking on condition of
&gt;  &gt; anonymity, told a more complicated story. They said that a smaller
&gt;  &gt; list of questionable songs was originally generated by the corporate
&gt;  &gt; office, but an overzealous regional executive began contributing
&gt;  &gt; suggestions and circulating the list via e-mail, where it continued
&gt;  &gt; to grow.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Either way, compliance with the list varied from station to station.
&gt;  &gt; Angela Perelli, the vice president for operations at KYSR (98.7 FM)
&gt;  &gt; in Los Angeles, said the station was not playing any of the listed
&gt;  &gt; songs and had previously pulled a couple of the cited songs, "Jumper"
&gt;  &gt; by Third Eye Blind and "Fly" by Sugar Ray, on its own accord. On the
&gt;  &gt; other hand, Bob Buchmann, the program director and an on-air
&gt;  &gt; personality at WAXQ-FM (104.3) in Manhattan, said that some songs on
&gt;  &gt; the list ("American Pie" by Don McLean, "Imagine" and others)
&gt;  &gt; happened to be among the most-played songs on his station. In the
&gt;  &gt; meantime, the station decided not to broadcast some songs even though
&gt;  &gt; they did not make the list, such as "When You're Falling," a
&gt;  &gt; collaboration between Peter Gabriel and Afro-Celt Sound System that
&gt;  &gt; had fictional lyrics too eerily similar to the truth.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; In 1942 the United States government issued a list of suggested
&gt;  &gt; wartime practices for radio broadcasters. In the interest of national
&gt;  &gt; safety, it advised radio programmers to ban weather forecasts, which
&gt;  &gt; could help the enemy plan a bombing attack, and to avoid
&gt;  &gt; man-on-the-street interviews and listener music requests in case the
&gt;  &gt; interviewee or caller was a spy conveying a coded message to the
&gt;  &gt; enemy in words or song.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; The new list is clearly different. Instead of promoting national
&gt;  &gt; safety, its intended aim is to ensure national mental health, though
&gt;  &gt; First Amendment supporters may point to it as the first shadowy
&gt;  &gt; blacklist in what President Bush says will be a war against
&gt;  &gt; terrorism. Radio programmers and producers outside of Clear Channel
&gt;  &gt; said that they found the list bewildering. "There are obviously songs
&gt;  &gt; on there that people could take the wrong way," said Michael Stark, a
&gt;  &gt; freelance producer who works on "The Tom Joyner Morning Show" on the
&gt;  &gt; ABC Radio Network. "But there are just as many that could be used to
&gt;  &gt; heal and bring context to the tragedy. It seems from the list that
&gt;  &gt; they don't want anything that comes close to making waves."
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; In an odd anomaly on the list, a specific song or songs are mentioned
&gt;  &gt; for each artist except for one: the politically minded rap-rock group
&gt;  &gt; Rage Against the Machine. For this band, the list simply considers
&gt;  &gt; "all Rage Against the Machine songs" questionable.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Tom Morello, the guitarist in Rage Against the Machine, said via
&gt;  &gt; e-mail that the band's music "is diametrically opposed to the kind of
&gt;  &gt; horrible violence committed against innocent people" that occurred in
&gt;  &gt; the Sept. 11 attacks, "which we condemn in the strongest possible
&gt;  &gt; terms."
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; "If our songs are 'questionable' in any way," he added, "it is that
&gt;  &gt; they encourage people to question the kind of ignorance that breeds
&gt;  &gt; intolerance � intolerance which can lead to censorship and the
&gt;  &gt; extinguishing of our civil liberties, or at its extremes can lead to
&gt;  &gt; the kind of violence we witnessed" last week.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Nina Crowley, the executive director of the Massachusetts Music
&gt;  &gt; Industry Coalition, a free-speech organization, worried that this was
&gt;  &gt; just the beginning of suppression of artistic expression and that
&gt;  &gt; politicians and corporations that have been trying to restrict access
&gt;  &gt; to popular music may expand and perpetuate this list. "President Bush
&gt;  &gt; said to be prepared for a long engagement," she said, "so this could
&gt;  &gt; potentially continue and grow, and these songs could be removed from
&gt;  &gt; the public ear for a long time. This list has eliminated songs about
&gt;  &gt; flying and falling, but when something else happens, do we remove all
&gt;  &gt; the songs about trains and whatever else?"

Subject:Re: [onepeoplesproject] NYT article on European response to Bush on WTC<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Dave forwarded the New York Times article attached below. I responded to
this once off the top of my head, but I have been considering it more
and would like to add a few points. I think that it is very important
for us to build a anti-war united front and in that process unite
anti-imperialists and revolutionaries. So I make the points below in the
spirit of advancing our understanding of the world and hopefully our
ability to fight to transform it.

Dave has accussed Unity &amp; Struggle of arguing that the bourgeoisie makes
history rather than the people. He basis this on two things. First,
becasue we have written that Imperialism is the principal aspect of the
contradiction between the people and imperialsim (meaning that at this
momnet in time Imperialsim has the upper hand on the people, this seems
obvious enough, Bush stole the presidency, they killed Kabila, Sharon is
prime minister in Israel etc. ). Second because we argued that Bush was
a serious threat and defeating him  was the main task of the people at
this time, in this place, under these conditions. Which to Dave menat
that we place our hopes in bourgeois politicians and the democratic
party; This is not true but we also realize that the people have been in
a retreat, probably since the death of Mao, but certainly after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, which if nothing else gave free reign to
US Imeprialism.
    In his e-mail below Dave exposes himself. It is he who believes that
the bourgeois make history (the European bourgeois of course). We should
not be mistaken, Bush is taking us to war, and we along with the people
of the world are the only ones who can stop it. The big bourgeois of
Europe will not stop him. Dave is also wrong in his belief that there is
no difference between Bush and Gore. While it is true that they both
belong to parties of Imperialism. And that the democrats are lining up
behind the new furer, It would also be true that the republicans would
line up behind Gore if he were president, but he would be moveing  in a
different direction.
     Bush and Gore represent different sections of the  big bourgois.
Gore/Clinton acted as policeman of the world, trying to unite  around
the international class of finance capitalists and their institutions
(the world bank, IMF, United Nations), representig the so-called "new
economy" (Al Gore caliming to have invented the internet!). The bombing
of Yugoslavia was carried by NATO, US troops under a Beligium commander.

    Bush, on the other hand,  does not even  know how to use a computer,
all he knows is oil. He doesn't want to police the world he wants to
bomb it, bomb it back to a Mad Max utopia where gasoline and oil replace
gold as the standard of exchange. He wants to establish US military
domination throughout the world. He is reviving the old imperialsit
revilaries (this is really what is being talked about in the article
that Dave forwarded  from the NYT)  that had subsided in the "united
front of Imperialists" aganist revolution, national liberation, and
socialism.
     What is ironic is that Dave is the one guilty of the very thing
that he accussed U&amp;S of, which is believing that Imperialist rivalries
have ended and that Imperialsim no longer means War. They are coming we
better wake up. Bush stole the presidency but he had accomplices. At
this moment Schundler is calling for a police state. Bush's selection
set the precendent for the sugar coated fascistic discussion around
extending Guiliani's rule in New York City. It should be clear now that
Nadir's candidacy was a terrible mistake, that can not be repeated in
Jersey,  unless you need to watch them goose step through your
neighborhood to see what is happening. We must build a movment to
opposse the war, rising fascism (they are moving in this direction
rapidly) and to impeach Bush. Hitler's got a new face, and  round up is
already beginging, the already had a night of broken glass in
Paterson(the star ledger reported that it would be easy for a terrorist
to blend in with all the Arab immigrants who live there) . We can not
repeat the mistake of Weimar.

  A Pause to Ponder Washington's Tough Talk

  By SUZANNE DALEY

  [B]RUSSELS, Sept. 15  After offering expressions of support
     immediately following this week's attacks on the United States,
  European allies are showing signs of backpedaling.

  The NATO allies have said they could support some military action. But
  now the caveats are beginning to roll in, making clear that the terror
  attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon will not translate
  into an unconditional writ for American retaliation.

  Particularly as talk in Washington has grown tougher, the allies have
  begun showing signs that they want a carefully thought out plan to
  combat terrorism, not a burst of military might that turns out to be
  brutal and ineffective.

  Many politicians here have begun distancing themselves from Washington's
  saber rattling. While President Bush has repeatedly described the terror
  attacks as "acts of war," Europeans officials are going out of their way
  to avoid such language.

  On a radio program the Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, said the
  European Union was "on watch" and "mobilized." But he added, "We are not
  at war."

  In France, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has cautioned that there is no
  "war against Islam or the Arab- Muslim world." Moreover, he signaled
  that France would not automatically support military action. "Our
  humane, political and functional solidarity with the United States," he
  said, "does not deprive us of our sovereignty and freedom to make up our
  own minds."

  Even the French left, often thought of as reflexively anti-American
  seemed to soften. The daily Le Monde ran a column headlined "we are all
  Americans." But it is clear that the continent remains wary of a
  gung-ho, simplistic military retaliation, it sees America capable of.

  Since Wednesday, when the NATO alliance for the first time invoked its
  mutual defense clause, strongly suggesting it would offer military
  support if the United states should ask for it, European leaders have
  been stressing non-military options.

  On a visit to Russia Thursday, The French foreign minister, Hubert
  Vdrine, argued for a broad antiterrorism plan that might incorporate
  military action, but did not overlook financial and logistical networks
  as well as political efforts. The next day the German defense minister,
  Rudolph Scharping, also urged a "measured" response.

  Even Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has offered Mr. Bush his full
  support, insisted on Friday that any retaliation "must and will be based
  on hard evidence," and his spokesman has said that the support does not
  amount to a "blank check."

  The invocation of the mutual defense clause does not actually obligate
  NATO countries to do much. Any decision to launch joint strikes would
  require further council deliberation, as would a decision to place
  national forces under NATO command. For most, the real decision will
  come when America maps out its plans and asks for help.

  In the meantime, even Russia, which took the highly unusual step of
  issuing a joint statement with NATO, has made clear since then that the
  United States and its allies should not rely on Central Asia to stage
  any retaliatory strikes against Afghanistan.

  "I see absolutely no basis for even hypothetical suppositions about the
  possibility of NATO military operations on the territory of Central Asia
  nations," Mr. Ivanov said.

  Newspapers across the Continent are also urging the Americans to use
  restraint. The French daily Liberation called for "extreme severity
  against identifiable culprits" but cautioned against "blind vengeance."

  An editorial published today in The Guardian urged Mr. Bush to consider
  diplomatic coercion, painstaking investigation, interdiction of
  terrorist funds and economic punishment before "sending his enormous
  bombs."

  "There is another way," the newspaper said. "It is less dramatic, less
  visceral, more statesmanlike."

Subject:Re: [nbpc] abolish the family<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Cliff,
I think that we should clearly oppose any attempts to coerce anyone economicly or
otherwise into marriage. On the other hand people have the right to be married if they
choose. You can't abolish the family from outside it. We are still fighting for
democrcay in the U.S. They have been attacking the family since the days of chattel
slavery and it is still going on along with the rest of slavery's legacy. Before we
can talk about "abolish the family" it has to be able to exist. (The destruction of
the projects in New Brunswick without any replacemnt housing destroyed countless
families). Just as we ultimately want to go beyond democracy to socilaism and
Communism, yet we realize that first we must get democracy, so to before we can
abolish the family it must be allowed to exist.
    Family is very much related to the struggle for democracy before the rise of
bourgeois democratic revolutions peasant families, serf families, slave families, were
devasted raped, exploited, torn apart. (the right of the first night, dramatized in
"Braveheart" and the horror of  rape during chattel slavery).
   We develop a program that demands children's right to get out of abusive
situations. We want women to be able to have the unchallenged right to divorce etc. We
must  fight for institutions that can provide services and resources that imperialism
puts on families. I think that the program certainly needs to be devloped and I think
that it is a significant aspect of women's emancipation and the democratic struggle.
But the slogan "abolish the family" is ultra-left.

&gt; virtually nothing to promote marriage in their welfare programs.
&gt;
&gt;                      Congress should make it clear that states are supposed
&gt; to be encouraging marriage, not just two-parent families, he said in an
&gt; article this summer. Also, he said, government should pay for premarital
&gt; education classes for low-income people considering marriage.
&gt;
&gt;                      Horn also supports financial incentives, such as West
&gt; Virginia's $100 monthly bonus for welfare parents who are married. He is
&gt; also open to more radical ideas; for example, identifying young women who
&gt; are at risk of getting pregnant and promising them $5,000 if they have their
&gt; first child after marriage.
&gt;
&gt;                      He also takes a conservative line on sex education,
&gt; supporting abstinence-only education, which bars talk of contraception..."

&gt;                      Horn, an academic who says he relies on results, not
&gt; theory, admits he has no evidence that government can do anything to
&gt; persuade poor people to get married.
&gt;
&gt;                      Still, he is using his new post at the Health and Human
&gt; Services Department to amplify the voices of conservatives who believe
&gt; marriage should be a bigger piece of welfare reform. He also is preaching
&gt; the virtues of sexual abstinence, saying unmarried people should not be
&gt; having sex.
&gt;
&gt;                      "I think it's the healthiest choice, yes I do," said
&gt; Horn, recently confirmed as assistant secretary for family support.
&gt;
&gt;                      But Horn, whose agency is responsible for welfare, Head
&gt; Start, child care, child abuse, foster care and adoption, is not a
&gt; cookie-cutter conservative.
&gt;
&gt;                      He says the success of welfare should be measured by
&gt; the effect on children, not by the number of people who have left welfare.
&gt; He volunteers that some people who have left welfare appear worse off than
&gt; they were. He says the welfare system should find a way to help people move
&gt; up the economic ladder by advancing to better jobs.
&gt;
&gt;                      "I don't think we as a nation ought to be satisfied
&gt; with simply moving people from welfare to the working poor," said Horn, who
&gt; is returning for his second tour of administrative duty at HHS after six
&gt; years leading the National Fatherhood Initiative(!), which he founded.
&gt;
&gt;                      It is Horn's views on marriage that have headlines.
&gt; Research suggests children raised in two-parent families are better off than
&gt; those who rely on just one. Traditionally, the welfare system discouraged
&gt; marriage, because eligibility for benefits is calculated using both parents'
&gt; income.
&gt;
&gt;                      In 1997, Horn suggested reversing the incentive. He
&gt; said married couples should get preferential treatment in public benefits
&gt; with limited spots, such as housing and Head Start.
&gt;
&gt;                      Women's groups complained that this could trap poor
&gt; women in abusive marriages because they stood to lose their benefits if they
&gt; lost their husbands. Some 90 groups opposed Horn's nomination to the HHS
&gt; job.
&gt;
&gt;                      In his Senate confirmation hearing, Horn renounced
&gt; these views, and easily was confirmed.
&gt;
&gt;                      "I've thoughtfully considered critics of that idea," he
&gt; said in an interview. "I've become convinced over time that ... it is too
&gt; easy to translate it into a discrimination issue against single moms.
&gt;
&gt;                      "I am not in this at all to bash single moms," he
&gt; added. "You know why?  Because children are in single-mother households. If
&gt; I were to kick single moms out of public housing or discriminate against
&gt; single moms, kids
&gt;                      would suffer. I have no interest in that."
&gt;
&gt;                      The turnabout has persuaded some of his loudest critics
&gt; to give him a chance. Leaders of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund,
&gt; which led the opposition to his nomination, plan to meet with him next
&gt; month. "He's at least willing to listen," said the group's president, Kathy
&gt; Rodgers.
&gt;
&gt;                      Horn is still unabashedly pro-marriage. The landmark
&gt; 1996 welfare law must be renewed next year, and the Bush administration is
&gt; formulating its position on how it should be changed, he said. But Horn has
&gt; personally detailed a number of ways that Congress might prod states, which
&gt; have done virtually nothing to promote marriage in their welfare programs.
&gt;
&gt;                      Congress should make it clear that states are supposed
&gt; to be encouraging marriage, not just two-parent families, he said in an
&gt; article this summer. Also, he said, government should pay for premarital
&gt; education classes for low-income people considering marriage.
&gt;
&gt;                      Horn also supports financial incentives, such as West
&gt; Virginia's $100 monthly bonus for welfare parents who are married. He is
&gt; also open to more radical ideas; for example, identifying young women who
&gt; are at risk of getting pregnant and promising them $5,000 if they have their
&gt; first child after marriage.
&gt;
&gt;                      He also takes a conservative line on sex education,
&gt; supporting abstinence-only education, which bars talk of contraception.
&gt;
&gt;                      "Heaven knows kids get contrary messages to abstinence
&gt; every day. The idea that if parents emphasize abstinence to teen-agers that
&gt; they will be completely oblivious to contrary messages that are coming from
&gt; the popular culture, that's a ludicrous assumption," he said.
&gt;
&gt;                      "Show me the 16-year-old who has never heard the word
&gt; condom, or has no idea what it is or how to use one. But I can show you a
&gt; lot of teen-agers who have never gotten the message that abstinence is the
&gt; best choice."

<pre>This was sent to a list that I am on. It gives us some idea of what we
are up against..


  Below is an excerpt from the weekly report of Democracy Corps on what
the polls are showing. Look esp. at the last
  section -- by 85-10, rolling back the tax cut is part of the answer
for "the military response to terrorism." Democracy Corps
  was started by James Carville, Stan Greenberg &amp; Robert Shrum.

  Americans Call for Military Response and Personal Sacrifice

          In a number of separate polls, more than 80 percent endorsed
the use of military force in response to last week's
  attacks.  Moreover, support for military actions remained strong even
if it required the use of ground troops (82 percent),
  thousands of American casualties (77 percent), the killing of innocent
civilians (68 percent), and even prolonged deployment
  over several years (66 percent).  Nonetheless, there is no rush to
judgment among the American public, as 81 percent say
  we should wait to be certain of those responsible before launching
attacks against Osama bin Laden or any other suspects.
  President Bush has repeatedly said America has been brought into a new
war, and more than two-thirds agree with him.  An
  excellent analysis released by ABC News this week demonstrates that,
since World War II, such overwhelming support for
  military action is not always easy to build but remains solid once it
is established.

          A smaller, but still sizable, majority support a prolonged war
against terrorism throughout the world rather than simply
  retaliation against those involved in last Tuesday's attacks (58 to 40
percent).  They seem to be under no illusions about how
  difficult this battle against terrorism will be - 65 percent are very
or somewhat worried that military action will produce further
  attacks in response -  but they believe it is essential to the
country's long-term safety.  They are nearly unanimous (89
  percent) in their agreement that a failure to respond militarily would
increase the likelihood of future attacks.

          Americans also know that a war against terrorism will come at
some price to them in their daily lives.  At this moment,
  with the wounds of last week's attacks still raw, they are willing to
pay almost any price in terms of their civil liberties.  Nearly
  3-in-4 (74 percent) in the New York Times poll and 61 percent in the
L.A. Times survey believe Americans will have to give
  up some of their personal freedoms in order to make the country safe
from terrorist attacks.  The liberties they indicate they
  would be willing to sacrifice or at least compromise include a wide
array of increased security and travel restrictions, metal
  detectors and ID checks in public buildings, and even random stops of
individuals matching the profile of suspected
  terrorists.  Americans draw the line, however, at random searches and
seizures, monitoring of personal communications
  (telephone, mail, or e-mail), and tracking of financial transactions.


  New Priorities In a New America

          The priorities of political leaders and voters have changed
dramatically in the past week.  President Bush proudly
  proclaimed his tax cut and education reform proposals as his top
priorities before the attacks, despite public disapproval of
  his tax cut and the inability of congressional leaders to reach
consensus on his already-weakened education package.  Now
  his relatively unpopular domestic agenda has been replaced by the new
war on terrorism, and the public approves of the shift
  in focus - 79 percent agree that fighting terrorism should be the
focus of Bush's administration, and 64 percent say it is the
  number one priority for Bush and the Congress to address.  The issues
which previously dominated voters' concerns - the
  economy (20 percent) and education (7 percent) - are still important
but have been placed in a new context after the terrorist
  attacks.

          Before the attacks, President Bush and Democrats in Congress
were locked in a fierce battle over the disappearance of
  our record surpluses, competing spending priorities, and how to avoid
dipping into the Social Security surplus while meeting
  the federal government's fiscal obligations.  Today, there is little
debate over spending from the Social Security surplus to
  fund disaster relief efforts and the military response.  However,
these new demands do not negate the fundamental questions
  that faced us before the attacks - in fact, they only multiply the
urgency.  How can the federal government meet its obligations
  in the areas of retirement security, education, and health care while
helping bail out the airline industry (67 percent favor),
  rebuilding the Pentagon and lower Manhattan, and supporting a renewed
commitment to "homeland security" and a new war
  on terrorism?  For 85 percent of Americans, rolling back the Bush tax
cut is at least part of the answer.  This overwhelming
  support for a rollback of the earlier tax cuts passed by Congress
directly refutes the push by some Republicans in Congress
  to cut capital gains taxes as part of an economic stimulus package.
Research has consistently shown us that, even in times of
  relative peace when our country is not nearly as united in purpose as
it is today, taxpayers will gladly pay their fair share as
  long as they feel their money is being well spent by the government.
With the priorities so clear and the need so great, there
  is little doubt that Americans are more than willing to do their part
to help our country meet these challenges.

  NBC News/Wall Street Journal - 9/16
  Please tell me which ONE you feel is the most important priority for
the President and Congress to address this year.

  Fighting terrorism      64
  Strengthening the economy       20
  Reforming the education system  7
  Dealing with health care costs  6
  Not sure        3


  Do you favor or oppose the United States' spending money on a military
response to terrorism even if it means rolling back
  some of the tax cuts that Congress passed this year?

  Favor   85
  Oppose  10
  Not sure        5

 Foreign Press Reveals Collin Powel Negotiated Afghanistan War Months
 Before Suicide Air Attacks:  Motive is Oil Profits for Multinational
War
 Partners

 The BBC and an Indian news agency in seperate stories, one months
before
 and one shortly after the suicide air attack on America, have presented

 the most horrendous picture to date regarding the true nature of the
 terror in NYC and elsewhere:  Prior knowledge.

 Those backing President Bush's request for a coalition had better make
 certain they are getting their fair share of the spoils of war, a war
 arranged months before the suicide air attacks against the US.  A pact
 for war against the Taliban was made between the United States, CIS
 (Russia), Pakistan, and India to facilitate a Middle-East to S.E. Asia
 Oil Pipeline, which cannot take place with growing political and
 religious upheaval in the region at the hands of the Taliban.  Iran is
 thought to be a covert member to the pact. The combat was initially
 slated for mid October, which would seem to account for warnings that
 preparing for war will take time.

 The problem is that the ONLY logical pipeline route runs for nearly a
 thousand miles along the Afghanistan border with Iran and Pakistan,
 (largely so close as to be visible from the border. This route would
 seem to provide the US with the best incentive to date to cooperate
with
 Iran by, in essence, competing with a Chinese backed oil pipeline
 project serving the same oil fields in northern Iran and points south,
 preventing China from obtaining a defacto monopoly holder on oil
 supplies for SE Asia. The Chinese began negotiating that project in
 1997, causing a great deal of consternation for the Clinton
 administration and major US oil companies who stood to gain little in
 the project.

 However, the Taliban are fomenting both religious and political
 instability in the region between Iranian and Pakistani Shiites and
 Taliban Sunni Islamic sects, with notable success. This unrest makes
 impractical the financial investment and international cooperation
 required to construct the pipeline.

 The solution was apparantly to be death warrants for both the Taliban
 leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, and capitalistic terrorist Osama bin
Laden,
 who had apparantly grown too profitable and too strong for his former
 CIA masters to control. Destruction of the Taliban was imperative, but
 political needs would not permit a simple solution.

 For Pakistan and India, long bitter rivals, to partner would require
 only sufficient profits to make peace between them more palatable.
 However, Pakistan required a significant motive beyond profits to risk
 internal conflict due to its nation's divided religious and political
 landscape, all intertwined with allegiances to the Taliban.  There
 needed to be an extremely irresistible reason for the nation's
 leadership to back/support military action against what their own
 citizens considered a virtual spiritual ally.

 In like manner, Iran required an irresistible reason to publicly
support
 with vocal blessings American interests in any such action, and at the
 same time, needed a way to salve bitter wounds between the two
countries
 which would allow future joint financial ventures.

 In similar manner, the United States needed a very powerful and
 irresistible reason to mobilize America into supporting such a war, a
 war which would be extremely difficult to prosecute, as the Soviet
Union
 could testify of first hand, having found the Soviet-Afghanistan war to

 be their 'Vietnam.'

 The logical solution which would indeed provide irresistible reasons
for
 all concerned, would now seem to be the horrific terror campaign
against
 the NYC and Washington DC by former CIA strong man, Osama bin Laden,
who
 perhaps is still on the payroll after all.

 Seperately, it seems, one of the terrorists was seen by Mossad agents
to
 have consulted with Iraqi intelligence operatives prior to the attack,
a
 matter passed to CIA as a warning that perhaps Iraq and Afghanistan
were
 partnering.  US Intelligence confirms this event but claims it was not
 because the terrorism was sponsored by Iraq, a matter not evident to
 Mossad, yet CIA seems to know.  Indeed, the conference was likely for
 the personal sale of information regarding the truth of the coming
 attack, which in part accounts for Iraq's somewhat even handed
 statements on the dissaster, as well as those of Libya.  Both nations
 would now seem to be jointly blackmailing US intelligence for a slice
of
 the action and continued safety - in exchange for kind words and a
 hands-off policy towards the looming military action.  .

 The attack comes in the wake of revelations by author James Bamford in
 his book Body of Evidence of a secret plan for US military intelligence

 operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American targets... blow

 up buildings, shoot down civilian airliners, blow up American war
ships,
 and assassinate American citizens... for political gain.  Operation
 Northwoods was signed off by all five Joint Chiefs of Staff under the
 Kennedy administration as a way to foment public support for a war
 against Cuba, who would be blamed for the terrorist acts.  Rejected
 sternly by President Kennedy, which may have contributed to reasons
 behind his assassination, this Reichtag fire approach to political gain

 may have been the model for September 11, shifting the blame this time
 to the Taliban homeland. What would make a more irresistible excuse for

 war?

 In light of these revelations, American media needs to decide if it
will
 continue to ignore truth and the principles of journalism for its
 preferred role as Fourth Estate PR spokesperson of government. Will
they
 tell America these facts or hide what the rest of the world already
 knows through news agencies which have no such loyalties?

 Will American politicians find themselves being asked by their
 constituents if they knew in advance of this death pact, and have the
 blood of innocents on their hands as coconspirators, or will they
demand
 a full accounting of the facts before signing off on the blood lust
 boiling over as result of this war plot?

 For more information, please review the following news sources:

 The first is a BBC story of a former Pakistani diplomat coming forward
 to tell of his country's knowledge of the planned war, concerned
perhaps
 that the air attacks were not as advertised. Find it at:

 &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1550000/1550366.stm&gt;

 The above article confirms the second, which was written by an Indian
 news agency months before the attack and is much more detailed:

 &lt;http://www.indiareacts.com/Story33.htm&gt;

 H. Michael Sweeney is a published author in the area of personal
privacy
 and safety, and an expert on disinformation and an investigative writer

 specializing in crimes of the intelligence community. Mr. Sweeney is
one
 of many persons preparing to educate America of the existence of these
 facts.

 "America will undoubtedly have its unstoppable war thanks to the Fourth

 Estate, but at what price?" asks Mr. Sweeney.  "Only those powerful men

 who know the truth will profit, and every American will have paid for
it
 with their souls, others with their blood."  He adds that "It is
 extremely ironic that this plan comes so close on the heels of the
 release of the James Bond film, The World is Not Enough, which
parallels
 many of the key elements of the underlying story."

<pre>I think that it was Kruschev whoannounced "we will crush you". By this he meant that
the Soviet Union will produce more stuff than the capitalists. His mistake was not
that he was wrong about that; his mistake was that he believed that building socialism
was essentially the same as building capitalism. That is socialism achieved through
production.
This is the essence of your line "we get out more than you" (which is a fact only in
your mind); it was the same point made earlier, "I register more voters".
You don't get out as many papers as the NY Times and you don't register as many voters
as the republicans or the democrats.
So if your measure of correctness is based on numbers of papers handed out and voters
registered than the bourgeois are better revolutionaries than you.

This line has been talked about quite a bit recently. It is economism. That is the
belief that production equals transformation. The line that the Soviet Union would
"build socialism" through industrialization. Leninism developed in the struggle
against economism, if you are interested you might read Class Struggles in the USSR
volume 1 by Charlie Bettleheim. (they got it at Alexander Libary). He does a very
thorough exposure of the line taht you are advocating.
I hope that you can find time to read it, it would be nice to base our practice and
discussion on revolutionary theory rather than empricist opinions. If we are truly
interested in self-criticism we might try to consider the effect of "american common
sense" on our thinking. The essence of which is american pragmatism. Which is the
theory that is practiced widely in New Brunswick.

<pre>I think that you are quoting Mao. You might want to read that essay. Speaking of
doctrinaires and lazybones.
Mao is speaking of people who refuse to study and prefer repeating slogans over and
over.
However,  Lenin did say without revolutionary theory there is no revolutionary
movemnt. Which is precisely the problem that we are facing. We have productionists on
our left and on our right, both sides refuse to deal in any serious way with
revolutionary theory. Both our rightists and our "leftists" refuse to unite. on the
left we get "stick your apology, but unite and "fuck you, unite" and on the right "we
have to distance ourselves".  It is making me sick. We are facing the rise of fascism
and world war 3. If you tell people "fuck you" (or compare them to people who have
just commited atrocities) expect them not to unite with you. If Mao and Lenin haven't
made that clear that's because they probably expected you to learn that in
kindergarden.(By the way Lenin criticized anarchism but he also went out of his way to
organize with anarchists and to get them involved in the activity of the Soviet
Governement).
   I suspect that your comment "lazybones" is meant to be a critique of "U&amp;S
invisibility". I would have liked the paper to be there, in fact we went to Brower
commons, and were there alone. We have limited resources and limited time. If you
think that is lazy, who cares.We are not selling girl scout cookies for merit badges.
I certainly think that there is laziness on yr end, that is a refusal to deal in any
serious way with revolutionary  theory and facts, replacing it with opinion and
speculations. If you believe that Marxism is a scienec then you should study it like
one. The living soul of marxism is the concrete analysis of concret conditions.

I am not against working with h-fraud against the war, however it is certainly
suspicious that no one wants to "distance themselves" from him. His boycott
elections/nader line may be more congenial. Nonetheless, ignoring lessons from
kindergarten doesn't help. A good organizer is not someone who hands out the most
papers or registers the most voters, a good organizer is someone who can unite people
around a revolutionary political line. You can sell a million cookies but still your
activity has done more to dis-unite (or at least give enough pre-texts to make
splitting easy) than uniting.

If you are intersted in haveing a discussion around these things, I will be happy to
respond. If you are just going to keep on defending your activity without any thought
of self-criticism or serious study then I would prefer not to waste anymore time.

&gt; &gt;your mind); it was the same point made earlier, "I register more voters".
&gt; &gt;You don't get out as many papers as the NY Times and you don't register as
&gt; &gt;many voters
&gt; &gt;as the republicans or the democrats.
&gt; &gt;So if your measure of correctness is based on numbers of papers handed out
&gt; &gt;and voters
&gt; &gt;registered than the bourgeois are better revolutionaries than you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This line has been talked about quite a bit recently. It is economism. That
&gt; &gt;is the
&gt; &gt;belief that production equals transformation. The line that the Soviet
&gt; &gt;Union would
&gt; &gt;"build socialism" through industrialization. Leninism developed in the
&gt; &gt;struggle
&gt; &gt;against economism, if you are interested you might read Class Struggles in
&gt; &gt;the USSR
&gt; &gt;volume 1 by Charlie Bettleheim. (they got it at Alexander Libary). He does
&gt; &gt;a very
&gt; &gt;thorough exposure of the line taht you are advocating.
&gt; &gt;I hope that you can find time to read it, it would be nice to base our
&gt; &gt;practice and
&gt; &gt;discussion on revolutionary theory rather than empricist opinions. If we
&gt; &gt;are truly
&gt; &gt;interested in self-criticism we might try to consider the effect of
&gt; &gt;"american common
&gt; &gt;sense" on our thinking. The essence of which is american pragmatism. Which
&gt; &gt;is the
&gt; &gt;theory that is practiced widely in New Brunswick.

<pre>Flavio,
I think taht the recent events have made it clear enough that while "all politics is
local" that doesn't mean that international and national events and issues are not
played out locally. All politics is local means that everything that is
"international" is local to social groups who are taking part, it only becomes
international if we here about it. I think that issues local to New Brunswick still
need to be adresssed, at the same tiome the a\whole world is rapidly changing and we
are certainly on teh precipe of disaster, fascism and world war. There is talk of
appointing Guilainai to another term in NYC, Racial profiling is now being hailed as a
correct response, vigilantism is running rampid. Now is not teh time to stick our
heads in the sand. The exclusion of international and natioanl politics in teh
People's campaign last effort is now proving to have been a serious dis-service to the
people who wer were trying to organize, to people who we might have given soem of teh
ideological tools to understand what is happening in the world. We didn't do that.
That was a very serious mistake. It is too bad that the campaign could not realize
this and was allowed to nearly dis-intergrate by the refusal to be self-critical.

Subject:Bush and binlanden<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>This is an article from the Wall St Journal, explaining the Bush and bin
Landen family connection. The end of the article is clipped but it
reveals connections with Jimmy Carter and Texas oil and binLanden's.
This article is a pretty deep exposure especially considering it is a
bourgeois source. I think that it can be read as a warning to Bush Jr.
One of the main contradictions functioning in this crisis is between
International Imperialist finace capital which is operating under the
banner of "Globolization", and U.S. based Imperialism. This
contradiction was represented clearly in the past presidential election
between Gore ("I invented the internet"/ "New Economy", "Globilization"/
NATO, United Nations etc.) and Bush ("old economy" oil, unilateral
"America first" etc). This contradiction is also playing out within
Bush's administartion with Collin Powell representing the interests of
International Cpaital. Bush wants to establish a US military
dictatorship over the world. This is what is meant by "US led coalition
against terrorism". Powell is trying to  build coalition and work within
NATO. Bush is pushing in the dircetion of world war which would be good
for the Oil Industry, since oil  will be obsolete soon if technology
continues to advance and is allowed to be utilized. The foreign minister
of Iran spoke on Charlie Rose tonight and sd that Iran would join a
United Nations coalition against terrorism but they would not join a US
led coalition.  A UN action would probably end up looking like a
Clintonian bombing campign with the death of bin Landen as the goal. A
US led action will have as its goal militarty occupation of the middle
east and could potentailly draw in other imperialist powers, and other
countries against the US.
We need to opposse both the Jihad and the Crusade and raise the banner
of anti-imperialism and revolutionary democracy. Impeaching Bush would
be a first step.
The article below provides a lot of info that could be further
researched.

Wall St. Journal Sept. 27 2001
Bin Landen Family tied to U.S. Group

If US boosts defense spending in its quest to stop bin Landen's alleged
terrorist activities, there may be one unexpected beneficiary: Mr. bin
Landen's family.
Among its far flung business interest, the well-heeled Saudi Arabian
clan-which says it is estranged from Osama- is an investor in a fund
established by Carlyle Group, a well connected Washington merchant bank
specializing in buyouts of defense and aerospace companies.
      Through this investment and its ties to Saudi royalty, the bin
Landen family has become aquatinted with some of the biggest names in
the Republican Party. In recent years, former President Bush,
ex-secretary of Sate James Baker and ex-Secretary of Defense Frank
Carlucci have made the pilgrimage to the bin Landen family headquarters
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bush makes speeches on behalf of Carlyle
group and is senior adviser to its Asian Partners fund, while Mr. Baker
is its senior counselor. Mr. Carlucci is the group's Chairman.
    Osama is one of 50 children of Mahammed bin Landen, who built the
family's $5 billion dollar business, Saudi Binlanden Group, largely with
construction contracts from the Saudi government. Osama worked briefly
in the business and is believed to have inherited as much as $50 million
from his father in cash and stock, although he doesn't have access to
the shares, a family spokesman says. Because Mr. bin Landen 's
citizenship was revoked in 1994, Mr. bin Landen is ineligible to own
assets in the Kingdom, the spokesman added.
   The bin Landen family has long disowned Osama, and has co-operated
fully with several federal investigations into his activities. The
family business, headed by Osama's half-brother Bakr, epitomizes the
US-Saudi alliance that the suspected terrorists often rails against.
After 1996 truck bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 US
servicemen, Saudi Binlanden group built military barracks and airfields
for US troops.
    People familiar with the family's finances say the bin Landen's do
much of their banking with National Commercial Bank in Saudi Arabia and
with the London branch of Deutsche Bank AG. They also use Citigroup Inc.
and ABN Amro, the people said.
    "If there were ever any company closely connected to the US and its
presence in Saudi Arabia its the Saudi Binlanden Group," says Charles
Freeman of the Middle East Policy Council, a Washington nonprofit
concern that receives tens of thousands a year from the bin Landen
family. "They're the establishment that Osama is trying to overthrow".
     Mr. Freeman, who served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia during
the Gulf War, says he has spoken to two of Osama's brothers since the
WTC attack. They told him, he says, that the FBI has been "remarkably
sensitive", tactful, and protective" of the family during the current
crisis, recognizing its longstanding friendship with the U.S....
    A US inquiry into bin Landen family business dealings could brush
against some big names associated with the US government. Former
President Bush said through his chief of staff, Jean Becker, that he
recalled only one meeting with the bin Laden family, which took place in
Nov. 1998. Ms. Becker confirmed that there was a second meeting in Jan.
2000, after being read the ex-Presidents subsequent thank you note.
"President Bush does not have a relationship with the bin Landen family"
says Ms. Becker. "He's met them twice"....
