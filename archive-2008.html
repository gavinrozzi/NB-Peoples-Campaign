FREE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS OF THE EMPIRE – STRUGGLE FOR THEM – COMMITTEE IN SOLIDARITY WITH CUBA – PUERTO RICO
 
Message received . . .
 
Brothers and Sisters:
 
Ramón finds himself subjected to further punishing conditions since las December 11th and for this reason he has not been able to send all the letters and greetings for the new year to his friends around the world.  In a very brief 5 minute telephone conversation this morning, December 20, he asked me to send this message to all  the sisters and brothers that do so much to promote the cause of the Cuban 5 and to achieve genuine justice in this case.  It is because of this that I hastily prepared this message in his name and our family’s, full of the love that inspires us to continue to struggle for the freedom of our family members.  Also receive on behalf of our daughters a warm greeting and the wishes that you have a merry Christmas and that you have a prosperous new year 2008.
 
Elizabeth Palmeiro Casado.

Message from Ramón Labañino Salazar
 
Dear Brothers and Sisters Throughout the World:
 
 We are now nearing the celebrations for Christmas and the 2008 new year and we want to send you our greetings accompanied with all the gratitude and affection for the support you’ve shown to this cause which united us:  The solidarity with Cuba and the freedom of the five.
 
At this time we always reflect on the things we have done and have to do, and, it is for this reason that upon remembering all the activities that have been realized during this year 2007 with purpose of gaining more solidarity with our cause, that we are filled with strength and more optimism in the certainty of our victory.
 
It doesn’t matter how long this cruelty continues, that victory will be ours and because of this we will continue to struggle alongside all of you to bring an end to the false morality of the empire that says it struggles against terrorism and yet keeps us imprisoned not recognizing the history of terrorist attacks against the people of Cuba.
 
From Argentina to Canada and the United States, throughout Central America and the Caribbean, from the other side of the Atlantic, from Spain to Vietnam and Australia, in the African Continent, in every corner of the planet, the voice of justice has been heard demanding our freedom.  Your letters inform us every day about all the actions, events, and demonstrations of solidarity.   Always count on us to be there for every just cause, soon we will join all of you.
 
Thank you brothers and sisters for letting us know that we can always count on you to bring an end to so much injustice.  Injustice that for more than 10 years has kept us away from our loved ones and our beloved homeland.
 
For Cubans these celebrations are also accompanied by those that he hola for yet another anniversary of the revolution that returned our dignity and freedom to us.  Dignity and freedom that today many peoples of our continent struggle for.
 
 
Long live the 49 anniversary of the triumph of the Cuban Revolution!
 
Until Victory Always!

Indomitable/Unyielding
 
They come to ask me to surrender
to betray my country and my ideals
they even offer jewels and beautiful things
and riches and limitless money that I would have.
 
They come to tell me to betray
that there is no reason to struggle
that lacking love and emotions
without principles
is indeed an infertile valley.
 
Stubborn, Insolent and Infamous
they do not know the fidelity to ideals
and that I would prefer to die in combat with them
how rich to live among the infamous.
 
I will live and struggle among our people
and will leave betrayal and treason to the cowards.
 
Ramón Labañino Salazar
 
“ . . . the matters that we presenting provide us at this time the biggest of our opportunities to free the Five.  This is a critical moment and it is very important that the network of support is aware and actively involved in the case.”  Leonard Weinglas, northamerican lead defense lawyer.

PROLIBERTAD ALERTFBI/NYPD Grand Jury Subpoenas Target Boricuas:The FBI/NYPD Anti-Terrorism Task Force (Joint Terrorist Task Force) has been visiting Puerto Ricans and serving them with Grand Jury subpoenas. In one case they claimed to be investigating the “extremist group: The Welfare Poets”. Two others have been served with Grand Jury subpoenas to appear at the Federal Court at 225 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn on Friday, January 11, 2007 at 9:30 a.m. and, as of this communication, one is being sought to be served.As was the case with the assassination of Machetero Leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios on September 23, 2005, a key historical date for the Puerto Rican Independence Movement, the FBI/U.S. Justice Department has chosen the  date of January 11 for the Grand Jury hearing in New York, a date when independence forces celebrate the birth and contributions of Eugenio Maria de Hostos to the independence struggle against Spain.To date, subpoenas to appear before the Grand Jury have been issued to; Tania Frontera, a graphic designer, pro-independence activist and participant in the Vieques struggle, activist and social worker Christopher Torres and filmmaker Julio Pabón, Jr. In addition, there are indications that Hector Rivera, one of the founders of the political/cultural group the New York based “Welfare Poets,” was visited to be served with a subpoena but was not home in NY at the time.In Puerto Rico the group La Nueva Escuela convened a meeting with a broad range of pro-independence political forces to plan the response and mobilize legal and political resources. They also appealed to those active in the FBI Out of Puerto Rico campaign. A demonstration in front of the Federal Court House in San Juan has been called for January 10th.In New York City on Saturday, December 29, 2007, Puerto Ricanpro-Independence activists, organizations and allies met with some of the subpoenaed activists, family members, legal advisors, friends and allies, to update themselves on the activities of the FBI/NYPD anti-terrorism agents leading to the Grand Jury hearings on January 11th. A call for a mass protest on January 11th at the Federal Court House in Cadman Plaza, Brooklyn was made, work committees were formed, a list of legal resources was presented and a general call outlined for support for these latest targets of Federal Grand Jury repression. A flyer is being drafted, and everyone is urged to mobilize.The Hostos 111 Grand Jury Resistance Movement is the tentative name of this mobilization and an email has been established while a toll-free number is setup where messages and endorsements can be left.The email is: resistgrandjury@... are asked to email endorsement for the demo on January 11th.

He was sentenced to eighty-four years for “an attempt to overthrow the government by force and violence.” As a result of pressure from the Puerto Rican Independence movement and the international community, he was released without conditions in September of 1979.

Independentists' subpoenas are postponedIt's presumed they are being investigated to obtain information about the group The Macheterosby Jose A. Delgado January 31, 2008 El Nuevo Diahttp://www.elnuevodia.com/diario/noticia/politica/noticias/aplazan_citacion_de_independentistas/355227NEW YORK– Federal authorities have postponed "indefinitely" the Broooklyn Grand Jury subpoenas of three young Puerto Rican independentists from New York.The subpoenas, which were set for tomorrow, have not been quashed, said Vicente "Panama" Alba, an activist in the Puerto Rican community in New York. "This development cannot be interpreted as a sign that the government has ended its campaign of repression against the people of Puerto Rico or our right to self determination and independence," said Alba.This is the second time that federal authorities postponed the subpoenas on graphic artist Tania Frontera, social worker Christian [sic] Torres and filmmaker Julio Pabon. The difference is that this time when they were notified of the postponement, they were not given a new date, said Alba.The three young independentists have indicated they do not know the reasons for which they were subpoenaed. However, it is thought to be part of an FBI effort to interview independentist sectors in search of information related to the clandestine group The Macheteros.Puerto Rican activists in New York, the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP), the National Hostos Independence Movement (MINH) and the Democratic congressman Jose Serrano, among others, have called the subpoena of the three young people, well known in their community, as an FBI "fishing expedition."According to sources close to the federal authorities, FBI director Luis Fraticelli may end his term as head of the federal police in Puerto Rico and wants to accelerate the investigations into the clandestine group.The FBI office in Puerto Rico has hinted that their investigations into The Macheteros got new life after the September 23, 2005 death of the organization's leader, Filiberto Ojeda Rios, during the execution of an arrest warrant.Frontera and Torres are known for their activism against U.S. military maneuvers in Vieques, a movement that generated consensus in Puerto Rico.

Letter from Avelino's Defense Committee
 
We extend to you our cordial greetings from Mayaguez.
As we have already denounced, Comrade Avelino Gonzalez Claudio was arrested by the F.B.I. today, and will be confronting charges which will be leveled against him outside of Puerto Rico.
Avelino was one of the comrades that the F.B.I. had been unable to capture during its repressive onslaught against our movement in 1985.  That period saw the imprisonment of comrades like Papo Segarra Palmer, who spent 19 years of his life in U.S. prisons.
 
We should not lose sight of the fact that the colonial police of Puerto Rico took part in the surveillance that was maintained against Avelino Gonzalez, and his eventual arrest.  This is after all an election year, and our colonial governor is susceptible to the pressures of the F.B.I. and a Republican Party in the U.S. which despairs over the failures of its undemocratic efforts against "terrorism," the very thing that they're guilty of inflicting on the world.
Avelino Gonzalez Claudio is a militant who has pursued the decolonization of Puerto Rico.  He is not unlike those who continued the struggle of Filiberto Ojeda, those who confronted the U.S. navy in Vieques, or those of us who today resist the abuses of the F.B.I. in our country.
The comrades of the Frente Socialista, (Socialist Front) the Committee for Human Rights and La Nueva Escuela, (The New School) call for a demonstration in support of Avelino Gonzalez Claudio, on  Monday February 11, 2008 at 3:00PM.  At that time, a hearing will be taking place at the colonial "federal" court in San Juan to discuss the extradition of the comrade to the United States.

Letter from Avelino's Defense Committee
 
We extend to you our cordial greetings from Mayaguez.
As we have already denounced, Comrade Avelino Gonzalez Claudio was arrested by the F.B.I. today, and will be confronting charges which will be leveled against him outside of Puerto Rico.
Avelino was one of the comrades that the F.B.I. had been unable to capture during its repressive onslaught against our movement in 1985.  That period saw the imprisonment of comrades like Papo Segarra Palmer, who spent 19 years of his life in U.S. prisons.
 
We should not lose sight of the fact that the colonial police of Puerto Rico took part in the surveillance that was maintained against Avelino Gonzalez, and his eventual arrest.  This is after all an election year, and our colonial governor is susceptible to the pressures of the F.B.I. and a Republican Party in the U.S. which despairs over the failures of its undemocratic efforts against "terrorism," the very thing that they're guilty of inflicting on the world.
Avelino Gonzalez Claudio is a militant who has pursued the decolonization of Puerto Rico.  He is not unlike those who continued the struggle of Filiberto Ojeda, those who confronted the U.S. navy in Vieques, or those of us who today resist the abuses of the F.B.I. in our country.
The comrades of the Frente Socialista, (Socialist Front) the Committee for Human Rights and La Nueva Escuela, (The New School) call for a demonstration in support of Avelino Gonzalez Claudio, on  Monday February 11, 2008 at 3:00PM.  At that time, a hearing will be taking place at the colonial "federal" court in San Juan to discuss the extradition of the comrade to the United States.  We must demand that the comrade remain in Puerto Rico.
Dr. Michael Gonzalez-Cruz

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign denounces the arrest of Avelino GOnzalez Claudio; the newest PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER!!

Write to him: 
Avelino Gonzalez-Claudio #09873-000MDC GuaynaboP.O. Box 2005Catano, PR 00963
 
Below is an AP article on his hearing on Monday and the a statment from his support committee...
 
Durante la tarde de ayer se llevó a cabo en la corte yanki en Puerto Rico la vista de identificación y extradición del compañero Avelino González Claudio. 
 
El compañero fue acusado en agosto de 1985 junto a otros compañeros y compañeras patriotas por la expropiación de $7 millones de dólares de la Wells Fargo en Hartford, CT.  Desde ese entonces estuvo en el clandestinaje. 
 
Adjuntamos la declaración que durante la tarde de ayer el compañero presentó frente al magistrado López.
Próximamente se informará sobre el Comité de Familiares y Amigos de Avelino González Claudio. 
 
Associated PressFeb. 11, 2008Although presumed Machetero Avelino González Claudio requested that he betried in Puerto Rico and declared himself a “political prisoner,” federalmagistrate Marcos López ordered his extradition to Hartford, Connecticut,in a generally automatic judicial proceeding.González Claudio’s lawyer also denounced to the judge that his client isreceiving “inhumane treatment” en the federal prison, because he is beingheld in a cell where the only window has been sealed with a sheet of metalso he can’t see daylight.Migdalia Torres, spokeswoman for MDC Guaynabo, stated in a letter writtento Associated Press that some cells in the prison are being repaired, andthat this work could require that the windows be temporarily sealed. Shedenied that González Claudio is receiving special or different treatmentthan the rest of the prisoners. “The treatment of prisoner González Claudio is no different than that anyother detainee awaiting trial and with the same security needs,” Torresdeclared in the letter.González Claudio was arrested last week for allegedly participating in the$7 million Wells Fargo robbery in Hartford, CT, on Sept. 12, 1983.González Claudio stated that he responds to that name, although heestablished through his legal representation that he does not recognizethe authority of the U.S. court in Puerto Rico to extradite him.Avelino González Claudio does not deny his identity. This Puerto Ricancitizen in front of you is Avelino González Claudio,” Juan Ramón AcevedoCruz, lead defense attorney for the supposed member of the BoricuaPeople’s Army-Machetero, stated to magistrate Lopez.“In terms of extradition, we vigorously object to any attempt by the U.S.government to remove González Claudio from his home, Puerto Rico,” addedthe attorney during the accused’s identification hearing.Federal prosecutor Jose Ruiz indicated to AP that the extradition couldtake more than 20 days and that if no bail is imposed in the jurisdictionto which he will be transferred, he would remain incarcerated. “If bail isimposed here, it is usually respected there,” Ruiz indicated.According to Acevedo, González Claudio, as a “political prisoner,” demandshis right to remain in his home country, as stated by international law.The attorney also demanded that the U.S. government comply with UN GeneralAssembly Resolution 1514, which declares colonialism to be “the negationof a fundamental human right.”“Since 1972, the UN Special Decolonization Committee has recognized theinalienable right of Puerto Ricans to self-determination and independenceaccording to Resolution 1514,” added the attorney, citing the resolution.The defense also requested a bail hearing, which was set by the magistratefor Feb. 21 at 1:30 in the afternoon.The federal prosecutor’s office, represented by Ruiz and Carlos Cardona,did not object to guaranteeing the suspect’s bail hearing.They successfully requested that González Claudio remain incarcerated inMDC Guaynabo because he is considered “a flight risk” and “a danger to thecommunity” because he used false names for 22 years and due to the natureof the crimes he is accused of.The magistrate stated that the denunciation of inhumane treatment is notunder the court’s jurisdiction.Faced with the attorney’s demands that he be able to visit GonzálezClaudio in a visiting room and not in a conference room where they have noprivacy, and that his shackles be removed so he can sign documents, themagistrate responded that the attorney would have to make the pertinentarrangements with the federal BOP. He indicated that the tribunal couldonly intervene if the situation persisted.While the hearing was taking place, there was a protest by independenceorganizations outside the federal building in Hato Rey.“This court represents the interests of the empire and they willfaithfully follow the orders of Washington, but we are going to fight allthe legal battles so he can remain here,” expressed the accused’s brother,Osvaldo González Claudio. He added that he hopes his brother will be tried“by his peers” and not in Connecticut.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign forwards this WONDERFUL NEWS from the NBHRN website about OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA!!
 
Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Oscar López Rivera transferred to medium security prison 
 
After 27 years in maximum and super-maximum security prisons, today, Wednesday, February 13, 2008, Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar López Rivera was moved to a medium security prison. 
 
This is a result of his excellent record in prison, but it is also due to the tremendous vigilance and defense of his rights by the organizations involved in the campaign for his and Carlos Alberto Torres release. While he is still being singled out for special, more onerous treatment, including being required to report to prison staff every two hours, this is the first time in almost three decades that he is in a medium security prison. 
 
Buoyed by the warm send-off from his fellow prisoners at the USP (maximum), and by the warm welcome from those at the FCI (medium), he will adjust to his new surroundings. 
 
The National Boricua Human Rights Network celebrates his transfer as a victory and urges all to write to Oscar. More news about the transfer to follow.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico­A judge on Thursday ordered an alleged member of a militant Puerto Rican independence group extradited to the U.S. mainland to face charges in a 1983 robbery in Connecticut.

U.S. District Judge Marcos Lopez rejected a bail request by Avelino Gonzalez Claudio, saying he "represents both a flight risk and a risk to the community."

Gonzalez, 65, was arrested by the FBI two weeks ago in his native Puerto Rico, where he had been working as a teacher under an assumed name.

He is one of more than a dozen people indicted in the Sept. 12, 1983 robbery of about $7 million from a Wells Fargo armored car depot in West Hartford, Conn. He faces charges including robbery and transportation of stolen money.

His lawyer, Juan Ramon Acevedo, said it was not clear when Gonzalez will be extradited.

Gonzalez is suspected of belonging to Los Macheteros, or the "machete wielders," a group that seeks Puerto Rico's independence from the United States and has claimed responsibility for a series of bombings and attacks in the 1970s and 1980s.

The FBI is still seeking two more fugitives in the robbery, including a brother of Gonzalez and the alleged mastermind, who is believed to be in Cuba.

He faces charges including robbery and transportation of stolen money.Copyright © 2008, The Associated Press

Not Guilty Plea In 1983 Armed RobberyBy EDMUND H. MAHONYCourant Staff WriterFebruary 29, 2008Avelino Gonzalez Claudio, a reputed member of the militant Puerto Rico independence group Los Macheteros, pleaded not guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Hartford to more than a dozen charges connected to the 1983 armed robbery of $7.1 million from the former Wells Fargo armored car depot in West Hartford.Gonzalez, 65, a fugitive for more than 20 years, was captured in Puerto Rico by the FBI on Feb. 7. He is believed to have lived on the island since the robbery and, at least recently, was teaching at a private school under an assumed name.After two brief court appearances on the island this month, a U.S. District judge in Puerto Rico ordered him transferred to Hartford, where he now is scheduled to stand trial for participating in what, in 1983, was the largest cash robbery in U.S. history.He is accused of multiple counts of robbery by force of a federally insured bank, conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, the interstate or foreign transport of stolen goods, and conspiracy against the United States.Records seized from Los Macheteros in Puerto Rico more than two decades ago show that the group, which means machete wielders or cane cutters in Spanish, intended to use the money to further its armed struggle for independence from the U.S. and to support leftist insurgencies in Latin America.Among other things, Los Macheteros took credit for blowing up 11 fighter jets at a National Guard air base and killing two sailors during an attack on a U.S. Navy bus. Both events took place in Puerto Rico.Thursday, Gonzalez, a thin, ascetic-looking man with a graying beard and long brown hair, was escorted into a small Hartford courtroom in manacles and a bright orange prison jump suit. During the brief proceeding, he listened intently to a Spanish translator and quietly answered "not guilty" when asked for his plea to the charges.He was one of more than a dozen Puerto Rico nationalists indicted in the spectacular 1983 robbery, which was carried out with the support of the government of Cuba. Los Macheteros recruited a young man from Hartford, Victor Gerena, to obtain employment at Wells Fargo and act as inside man during the robbery.Afterward, the group moved Gerena and the cash to Mexico City hidden behind false walls in a motor home. A former Cuban diplomat has said Gerena later was flown to Cuba after Cuban agents disguised him and provided him with a fraudulent Argentine passport. More than $2 million of the stolen cash went to Cuba with Gerena, according to the U.S. government and a former Cuban government source.Gerena is one of about 90 U.S. fugitives believed to have been granted asylum by former Cuban President Fidel Castro.With Gonzalez's capture, Gerena and Gonzalez's brother Norberto are the only suspects in the robbery who remain at large. Macheteros founder Filiberto Ojeda Rios died in a shootout with FBI agents in September 2005 at a home where he was hiding in the mountains of western Puerto Rico.Several sources familiar with the radical independence movement in Puerto Rico have said Gonzalez held a senior position in Los Macheteros at the time of the robbery, an operation the group had code-named Aguila Blanca, or White Eagle. In addition, they said he was one of four Macheteros who drove Gerena to Mexico.Contact Edmund H. Mahony at emahony@... © 2008, The Hartford Courant

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
 
Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5’s Women’s History Month Initiative. Starting from Sat. Match 1st-Monday March 31st we are calling on people to fax or mail out this letter to Louise Arbour The High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5’s mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!
 

Due to the U.S. government’s denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. The U.S. government’s denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security.

SUPPORT THE TEACHERS OF PUERTO RICO, 
WHO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF US ALL!
A crucial strike for all working people is now taking place in Puerto Rico!  The island's biggest labor union is waging a fight for survival, for free public education and against the privatization schools.  At stake are the universal right to unionize, to collective bargaining, to strike and workers' rights and the basic right of freedom of expression.  The Teachers' Federation of Puerto Rico (FMPR) has been on strike since February 21, 2008 in a life and death struggle against the anti-labor and repressive crusade of the colonial government.  The colonial administration of Anibal Acevedo Vilá has been refusing to negotiate for more than 27 months with no contract.  With more than 40,000 members, mainly women, the Federation has refused to be intimidated and is taking a courageous stand for the rights of all. 
The government's contempt for teachers, students and parents, as well as for their input in education, is so extreme that it locked out the teachers throughout the island, as well as hundreds of thousands of students, for two weeks during April-May 2006. The government, facing a fiscal crisis, was forcing the public sectors to endure the brunt of the crisis.
Now SEIU chief Dennis Rivera helped get Puerto Rico teachers union ousted so he could hijack members. While the clash between the teachers' militant leaders and the government was grabbing the headlines, Rivera was maneuvering to snatch control of the teachers for his Service Employees International Union.  Puerto Rico Governor Acevedo Vilá's Secretary of Education, Aragunde, has ruled that the federation will not be permitted to run in any new elections for a union to represent the teachers. 
More than support statements are needed! As support grows among workers, union members and independent unions in Puerto Rico and internationally, our support NOW will make a difference!! With growing potential for other unions in Puerto Rico to walk out in solidarity, public pressure greatly intensifies on the anti-worker union-busting administration in Puerto Rico.  Already, the colonial government faces a social and political crisis, as the school strike affects every part of the island. Solidarity actions by workers everywhere in support of the Puerto Rican teachers are crucial.
 
JOIN US IN SUPPORT OF PUERTO RICO'S TEACHERS AND IN DEFENSE
OF PUBLIC EDUCATION!
DEMONSTRATE YOUR SOLIDARITY!!

SUPPORT THE TEACHERS OF PUERTO RICO, 
WHO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF US ALL!
A crucial strike for all working people is now taking place in Puerto Rico!  The island's biggest labor union is waging a fight for survival, for free public education and against the privatization schools.  At stake are the universal right to unionize, to collective bargaining, to strike and workers' rights and the basic right of freedom of expression.  The Teachers' Federation of Puerto Rico (FMPR) has been on strike since February 21, 2008 in a life and death struggle against the anti-labor and repressive crusade of the colonial government.  The colonial administration of Anibal Acevedo Vilá has been refusing to negotiate for more than 27 months with no contract.  With more than 40,000 members, mainly women, the Federation has refused to be intimidated and is taking a courageous stand for the rights of all. 
The government's contempt for teachers, students and parents, as well as for their input in education, is so extreme that it locked out the teachers throughout the island, as well as hundreds of thousands of students, for two weeks during April-May 2006. The government, facing a fiscal crisis, was forcing the public sectors to endure the brunt of the crisis.
Now SEIU chief Dennis Rivera helped get Puerto Rico teachers union ousted so he could hijack members. While the clash between the teachers' militant leaders and the government was grabbing the headlines, Rivera was maneuvering to snatch control of the teachers for his Service Employees International Union.  Puerto Rico Governor Acevedo Vilá's Secretary of Education, Aragunde, has ruled that the federation will not be permitted to run in any new elections for a union to represent the teachers. 
More than support statements are needed! As support grows among workers, union members and independent unions in Puerto Rico and internationally, our support NOW will make a difference!! With growing potential for other unions in Puerto Rico to walk out in solidarity, public pressure greatly intensifies on the anti-worker union-busting administration in Puerto Rico.  Already, the colonial government faces a social and political crisis, as the school strike affects every part of the island. Solidarity actions by workers everywhere in support of the Puerto Rican teachers are crucial.
 
JOIN US IN SUPPORT OF PUERTO RICO'S TEACHERS AND IN DEFENSE
OF PUBLIC EDUCATION!
DEMONSTRATE YOUR SOLIDARITY!!

Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5’s Women’s History Month Initiative. Starting from Sat. Match 1st-Monday March 31st we are calling on people to fax or mail out this letter to Louise Arbour The High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5’s mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!
 

Due to the U.S. government’s denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. The U.S. government’s denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security.

Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5’s Women’s History Month Initiative. Starting from Sat. Match 1st-Monday March 31st we are calling on people to fax or mail out this letter to Louise Arbour The High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5’s mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!
 
Due to the U.S. government’s denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. The U.S. government’s denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
 
The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign has translated this Report from El Comite de Familiares y Amigos de Avelino Gonzalez Claudio to keep our supporters and allies updated on his situation
 
ProLibertad is calling on all our allies and supporters to participate in the AVELINO GONZALEZ CALL IN DAY Wednesday March 12th, 2008!!
 
We are asking peopel to call the Bureau of Prisons Central Office on Wed. March 12th, 2008 from 9am-5pm and demand to speak to Director Harley G. Lappin and demand that Avelino Gonzalez Claudio be removed from Maximum Security (where he is in a  cell 23 hours a day), he be allowed visitation rights, and receive telephone rights (so he can contact family and legal support).
 
PUBLIC PRESSURE CAMPAIGNS WORK!! WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THEIR CONDITIONS!!
 
PICK UP THE TELEPHONE FOR AVELINO ON WED. MARCH 12TH, 2008!!
_____________________________________________________________
 
Friends and Family of Avelino González Claudio, Puerto Rico
 
March 6, 2008
 
Avelino González Claudio was transported to Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and immediately appeared in court for identification and upon declaring himself indigent was appointed a public defense attorney.  A new bail hearing was set for last March 4th and was postponed so that his friends and family members could prepare for this hearing.  He was imprisoned at the state penal institution in Connecticut.  The address to write to him is:
 
Avelino González Claudio 09873-000
287 Bilton Road
P.O. Box 665
Somers, CT 06071
 
Avelino is in Maximum Security where he has not been allowed to use the telephone, even to call his lawyers or family members.  He is in total isolation for 23 hours a day with 1 hour out of solitary confinement.  Avelino has been denied his right to visitation by friends and family members.
 
The new bail hearing rules require that: (1) We identify witnesses to his character that can attend the hearing and (2) That we identify a person that can offer a guarantee of employment in Puerto Rico.  We ask that you contact us if you know of anyone who can employ Avelino in some type of computer related work
 
It was decided that the Hartford law firm of Attorney Jim Bergueen and two of his fellow attorneys would take charge of the defense of Compañero Avelino. Bergueen participated in the defense team in the case of the 1985 arrests and was the lawyer for Compañero Carlos Ayes, who was absolved of all the charges against him.
 
We are making preparations for the court to accept the appointment of the attorneys selected for this case.  For the time being, Avelino will remain incarcerated in Somers, CT, until he and his lawyers discuss and agree if they will request a transfer to another prison.
 
We recommend that you write to Avelino so that he can continue to feel the warmth of the solidarity that is so necessary when one is in solitary confinement.  As his lawyers continue to demand better conditions for Avelino, a letter writing campaign to the prison will begin asking that he be placed in general population.  We urge all those who can, to write to the address above in order to demand that he be released from solitary confinement.
 Hilton Fernández, Spokesperson

April Freedom Month 2008 Calendar
 
On April 4th, 2008 the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners will have completed 28 years in jail for FIGHTING PUERTO RICAN INDEPENDENCE!!
 
Every April, ProLibertad organizes a series of events to commemorate the arrests of our political prisoners. We use this month as a time to raise awareness around the prisoners and of Puerto Rico's colonial reality.
 
This year, we celebrate the release of Jose Perez Gonzalez, a Political Prisoner for his actions in support of the Vieques movement, and we denounce the arrest and incarceration of AVELINO GONZALEZ CLAUDIO!! Come to all the events and bring your friends and family!!
 
PROLIBERTAD FREEDOM CAMPAIGN OUTREACH DAY!!  We are kicking off Freedom Month 2008 with a day of outreach and street education in the South Bronx!!  We need volunteers to join us in handing out literature on the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners and Puerto Rican Independence in the South Bronx.  Help us make the Puerto Rican Political prisoners a household name!!
 
Join ProLIbertad on SATURDAY APRIL 5TH, 2008 FROM 12PM-3pm ON 149TH STREET AND 3RD AVENUE (take the 2 or 5 train to 149th St. and 3rd avenue stop)!!  Look for the Puerto Rican Flags!!

Man, you must know it! I had an intimate trouble.
My main organwas too small that I feel shy when I did it with my girlfriend.
I was afraid that she would tell me about it and left me once it had happened.
I didn't know what to do. I was depressed and always thought how I can change my life.
Once I received a letter with advertisement  and decided to try it.
The result was unexpected. My main problem was solved and now I am happy happy

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5’s Women’s History Month Initiative. Starting from Sat. Match 1st-Monday March 31st we are calling on people to fax or mail out this letter to Louise Arbour The High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5’s mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!Due to the U.S. government’s denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. The U.S. government’s denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security. The PDF format of the letter can be found at the Jericho Website: http://www.thejerichomovement.com/events5.htmlPLease download sign and fax or mail out IMMEDIATELY!!

Mari Mari NarvÃ¡ez
18-Abril-2008 | Mari Mari NarvÃ¡ez


BuscapiÃ©

Macheteros

Juro que preferirÃ­a ignorar estas visiones que me sobrecogen, pero mi  
mente, a veces distraÃ­da, me lo impide. Me atraen particularmente el  
ridÃ­culo y el patetismo. Y si se juntan -uf- me hacen el dÃ­a.

Hubiese dado cualquier cosa por ver el cruento desfile de los  
federales, asÃ­ bien bravitos, seriecÃ­simos, corpulentos como son,  
yendo a amedrentar a una joven de 29 aÃ±os (mi prima) que anda en  
preparativos de boda. Me la imagino saliendo de prisa hacia el  
trabajo y pensando en los zapatos que tiene que comprarse, en las  
invitaciones que no acaban de llegar, en quÃ© rayos se pondrÃ¡ en la  
cabeza, mientras el agente la intercepta e interrumpe su soliloquio  
del velo y de la flor para sentenciarle: â€œSabemos exactamente cuÃ¡l  
es tu apodo de macheteraâ€.

Â¿Machetera? De acuerdo, sus padres le pusieron Tania por Tania la  
Guerrillera, pero del bizcocho de boda a la selva boliviana hay un  
largo trecho.

Tiene que haber algo de ingenuidad o de chapucerÃ­a en esos agentes  
para creer que una patriota de cuna como mi prima accederÃ­a a  
colaborar con el FBI. Cuando a una le enseÃ±an desde reciÃ©n nacida  
que no hay nada que hablar con esos individuos pechugones, que se  
hacen los bravucones por no morirse de miedo, no hay Dios que le  
permita cruzar palabra con uno.

Tal vez en su investigaciÃ³n se les pasÃ³ poner en contexto a su  
personaje, Tania Delgado Soto, hija de Mildred Soto y del licenciado  
Edgardo Delgado BrÃ¡s, a quien todos en MayagÃ¼ez conocen como â€œTito  
Patriaâ€; nieta de don Edgardo Delgado, de doÃ±a Violeta BrÃ¡s;  
sobrina y alumna de Juan Mari BrÃ¡s.

Â¿De verdad habrÃ¡n ido donde ella y otros independentistas para  
buscar colaboraciÃ³n o son sÃ³lo ganas de joder? Ellos creen que  
intimidan y, mientras tanto, hacen el ridÃ­culo y multiplican la ira.

Van a tener que inventÃ¡rselo todo, como se inventaron esa historia  
de â€œBrianâ€ muriÃ©ndose de miedo ante Filiberto y asesinÃ¡ndolo.  
Bla. Me aburren tremendamente. MÃ­ster Fraticcelli, si estÃ¡ buscando  
macheteros, â€˜Iâ€™ve got something for youâ€™: todo boricua es  
machetero.

La autora es periodista.

Two of the harassed are Miguel Viqueira, a marine biologist and Tania Delgado Soto, a young Puerto Rican lawyer. Both are members of the "Nueva Escuela" (The New School).The New School identified those intervened as Miguel Viqueira and Tania Delgado Soto. "When Miguel was preparing to leave for work, several agents, armed and with bullet proof vests bearing the FBI initials, surrounded him and with a hostile and provocative attitude began to threaten him," said a press release."Although Miguel told them he had nothing to say to them and tried to close the door of his car to leave, they did not allow him to do so and continued insulting and threatening him. After a while they left without showing any judicial order for the intervention," the New School reported.As for Delgado Soto, who is an employee of Cooperative Development, two men and a woman from the FBI in a white van stopped her."When she refused to accede to their demand that she cooperate, and when she insisted on calling her lawyers, they left," the organization added.Héctor Pesquera, co-chair of the National Hostos Independence Movement (MINH), confirmed both interventions.From his perspective, the FBI "is harassing the independence movement in its zeal to keep sending the message that they rule, and that this is a colony."Edgardo Delgado Bras, Tania's father, said his 29 year old daughter called him to tell him what happened."This is a pattern; it's not isolated, to intimidate those of us who believe in independence," said Delgado Bras, also an attorney.The FBI spokesperson specified that they intervened with people in Yauco, Peñuelas, Bayamón, Guaynabo and San Juan. No one was arrested.The following persons will address the press:1. Dylcia Pagan- ex-political prisoner and fighter for Puerto Rican Independence2.

Who are the Puerto Rican and Cuban Political Prisoners?
Ben Ramos of Prolibertad will be joining us to explore the tactics and strategies used against our freedom fighters when confronting/opposing united states terrorist activities.  Join and continue the dialogue on what can be done for our political prisoners that our in the cross-fires of the US-led disinformation campaign.  Plan on defending our Right and Freedom of Self-Determination as the "war on terrorism" escalates fear to amass more power for multi-nationals to exert their agenda on Black and Brown communities and countries. 
Cuban 5:
Not only were they saving Cuban lives by opposing terrorism in Miami , they were in the service of all humanity. Three of the Cuban Five served in Angola against South Africa 's invasion. If you know the role that the Cubans played against apartheid, you can appreciate how truly heroic the Five are. Cuba , through its history and internationalism, supported African and Latin American countries and countries all over the world, to enable the people in those countries to free themselves and decide their own destinies. For more information about the case: http://www.thecuban5.org/thecase.html  
PR Political Prisoners 
During the 1970's and the beginning of the 80's, the prisoners were involved in community, union, student and political struggles in Puerto Rico and the United States. They fought for the people's right to high quality, free education. They worked to create community institutions such as alternative education programs, child-care centers, health centers, housing cooperatives, recreational facilities and political organizations. They participated actively in churches, student groups, unions, professional associations, committees against repression, campaigns against youth violence and drugs. In summary they challenged the U.S. political system in many ways. For more information about their case: http://www.prolibertadweb.com/id2.html

MOTHER'S DAY FOR THE CUBAN 5!! 
 
Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5’s Mother’s Day for the Cuban 5 Initiative. Starting from Thursday May 1st-Sunday May 11th (Mother’s Day) we are calling on people to fax or mail out this letter to Louise Arbour The High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5’s mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!
 

Due to the U.S. government’s denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. The U.S. government’s denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security.

Give the Cuban 5’s mothers and wives the great Mother’s Day gift of ACTION AND SOLIDARITY!!

We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5’s mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!
 
 
Due to the U.S. government’s denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas.

An Appeal to organize a "WORKING CONFERENCE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE CUBAN 5!"
 
September 12, 2008 marks the 10th year of the arrest of five Cuban citizens – Fernando Gonzales, Rene Gonzalez, Antonio Guerrero, Ramon Labanino, Gerardo Hernandez –who were portrayed as "spies" and "murderers" in the service of "Castro's Cuba." They were tried and convicted in an atmosphere of hype and hysteria in Miami, Florida. The verdict was goaded by ultra-right politicians and a highly orchestrated media campaign of disinformation with the tone of a lynch mob. 
 
At the trial there was not a single page of classified information produced showing evidence of espionage or any action directed against the US government. The frame-up charges were packaged as a necessarily vague "conspiracy" to, as the prosecutor actually put it to the jury, "destroy the United States of America." In the period of 17 months between arrest and trial, the five Cubans were subjected to brutal conditions of solitary confinement and near-total isolation to hinder the preparation of their defense. This psychological torture was aimed at breaking their will, in blatant violation of their rights under US law. The hope was to break their spirit and force "confessions" to the trumped-up "conspiracy" charges. But this failed and the trial was finally held in November 2000. They were convicted in June 2001.
 
The truth is that the Cuban Five infiltrated ultra-right Cuban-American organizations, with a clear history of terrorist attacks organized on US soil against the sovereign Cuban state in violation of US law. Over 3,500 Cuban citizens have died in such attacks since the Cuban Revolution triumphed against the Batista dictatorship in 1959. Many tens of billions of dollars worth of damage have been done to the Cuban economy. These attacks stepped up in the mid-1990s as the Cuban economy reeled from an economic depression. Tourist hotels were bombed resulting in death and destruction. Low flying planes – originating from US territory in violation of US law – repeatedly violated Cuban airspace. Only after the Cuban government presented clear evidence of such terrorist and criminal activities and repeatedly implored, to no avail, the Clinton Administration to do something about it did the Cuban Five carry out its courageous and dangerous work which the record shows saved lives in Cuba.
 
Today, a panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering the range of egregious violations committed by the prosecution in the original trial. In August 2005 a panel from the same Appeals Court ruled, in a stunning decision with virtually no precedent, to overturn the original trial verdict on the grounds that there could not be a fair and impartial hearing in the hostile climate of Miami, Florida. This ruling was subsequently reversed by the full court under heavy pressure from the Bush Administration's Justice Department.
 
Around the world, and increasingly inside the United States, the case of the Cuban Five, stands as one of the most brutal and outrageous injustices in modern history. As the facts have emerged and the truth about the Cuban Five becomes more known and publicized, Committees to support the Cuban Five have spread all over the world. Their incarceration continues under brutal conditions that have included solitary confinement and denial of family visitations and other violations of formal US laws. 
 
 Washington is paying an increasing political price as this ongoing travesty of justice enters its second decade. On May 2005, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations issued a stinging exposure of the arbitrary and iniquitous nature of the trial and conviction. The UN body emphasized that the Cuban Five were held in solitary confinement for 17 months, weakening their ability to mount an adequate defense; that most of the evidence against them was withheld from their attorneys, undermining an equal balance between the prosecution and the defense; and that the trial was held in Miami where it was impossible to select an impartial jury in a case linked with Cuba.
 
On January 2006 Amnesty International condemned the Bush Administration and US authorities for the treatment of the Cuban Five, specifically for the denials of family visitation rights for some of the Cuban Five prisoners. 
 
 An international call for world protests in solidarity with the Cuban Five in September and October 2008 has been issued. Now is the time for all supporters of the Cuban Five and all supporters of civil liberties and justice to step up our work on their behalf. Now is the time to reach out to broad layers of the US population, whatever their political views in general and on the Cuban Revolution in particular. Supporters of the Cuban Five begin by demanding that US authorities comply with US law and allow family members to visit their loved ones. In this Presidential and Congressional election year we aim to raise the issue of the Cuban Five and to reach out and win support from elected officials.  To mark the 10th anniversary of their arrests there will be organized public protests on Saturday, September 13. Out of this activity we aim to build support for a National Conference in October 2008 in New York City to support of the Cuban Five.
 
In this spirit, activists in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are issuing this Appeal to Organize a Working Conference in Solidarity With the Cuban Five on Saturday, June 14, 2008. The Working Conference will be just that, a Working Conference, not a political rally or solely a gathering of already engaged and committed activists. We want this Working Conference to generate activity and concrete campaigns from the grass roots – from religious communities and organizations; from the trade union movement; from young people, students and the broader academic community; from African-American and Latino communities; from fighters for women's rights; from gay and lesbian rights organizations; from consistent advocates for civil liberties and constitutional rights; from artists and cultural workers. 
 
This is our challenge. This is our appeal. Now is the time. Please Join Us June 14!

      Ana Belen Montes: The chronicle of an American Spy for the Cuban Government. Summary of the case

      By Manuel Cereijo 


      On 21 September 2001, the FBI arrested Ana Belen Montes, a US citizen born 28 February 1957, on a US military installation in Nurnberg, Germany. She was charged with spying for Cuban intelligence for the past five years. 



      ANA BELEN MONTES

      Montes graduated with a major in Foreign Affairs from the University of Virginia in 1979 and obtained a Masters Degree from the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in 1988. She is single and lived alone at 3039 Macomb Street, NW, apartment 20, Washington, DC. Until her arrest, Montes was employed by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as a senior intelligence analyst. She began her employment with DIA in September 1985 and since 1992 has specialized in Cuba matters. She worked at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, DC. Prior to joining DIA, Montes worked at the Department of Justice. In 1993, she traveled to Cuba to study the Cuban military on a CIA-paid study for the Center for the Study of Intelligence.


      Communication from the Cuban Intelligence Service (CuIS) to Montes via Shortwave Radio

      During a court-authorized surreptitious entry into Montes's residence, conducted by the FBI on 25 May 2001, FBI agents observed a Toshiba laptop computer.1 During the search, the agents electronically copied the laptop's hard drive. During subsequent analysis of the copied hard drive, the FBI recovered substantial text that had been deleted.

      The recovered text from the laptop's hard drive included significant portions of a Spanish- language message, which when printed out with standard font comes to approximately 11 pages of text. The recovered portion of the message does not expressly indicate when it was composed. However, it instructs the message recipient to travel to "the Friendship Heights station" on "Saturday, November 23rd."

      Although no date was on the message, November 23 fell on a Saturday in 1996. The FBI determined that this message was composed sometime before 23 November 1996 and entered onto Montes's laptop sometime after 5 October 1996, the date she purchased it. On the basis of its content, the message is from a CuIS officer to Montes.2 Portions of the recovered message included the following: "You should go to the WIPE program and destroy that file according to the steps which we discussed during the contact. This is a basic step to take every time you receive a radio message or some disk."

      During this same search, the agents also observed a Sony shortwave radio stored in a previously opened box on the floor of the bedroom. The agents turned on the radio to confirm that it was operable. Also found was an earpiece3 that could be utilized with this shortwave radio, allowing the radio to be listened to more privately.

      The recovered portion of the message begins with the following passage:

      Nevertheless, I learned that you entered the code communicating that you were having problems with radio reception. The code alone covers a lot, meaning that we do not know specifically what types of difficulty you are having. Given that it's only been a few days since we began the use of new systems, let's not rule out that the problem might be related to them. In that case, I'm going to repeat the necessary steps to take in order to retrieve a message.

      The message then describes how the person reading the message should "write the information you send to us and the numbers of the radio messages which you receive." The message later refers to going "to a new line when you get to the group 10 of the numbers that you receive via radio," and still later gives as an "example" a series of groups of numbers: "22333 44444 77645 77647 90909 13425 76490 78399 7865498534." After some further instruction, the message states: "Here the program deciphers the message and it retrieves the text onto the screen, asking you if the text is okay or not." Near the conclusion of the message, there is the statement, "In this shipment you will receive the following disks: . . . 2) Disks 'R1' to decipher our mailings and radio."

      Further FBI analysis of Montes's copied Toshiba hard drive identified text consisting of a series of 150 five-number groups. The text begins, "30107 24624" and continues until 150 such groups are listed. The FBI determined that the precise same numbers-in the precise same order-were broadcast on 6 February 1999 at AM frequency 7887 kHz, by a woman speaking Spanish, who introduced the broadcast with the words "Attencion! Attencion!" The frequency used in that February 1999 broadcast is within the frequency range of the shortwave radio observed in Montes's residence on 25 May 2001.

      Communication between the CuIS and Montes via Computer Diskette4

      Montes communicated with her CuIS handling officer by passing and receiving computer diskettes containing encrypted messages. The message described above that was contained on the hard drive of Montes's laptop computer contained the following passage:

      Continue writing along the same lines you have so far, but cipher the information every time you do, so that you do not leave prepared information that is not ciphered in the house. This is the most sensitive and compromising information that you hold. We realize that this entails the difficulty of not being able to revise or consult what was written previously before each shipment, but we think it is worth taking this provisional measure. It is not a problem for us if some intelligence element comes repeated or with another defect which obviously cannot help, we understand this perfectly-Give "E" only the ciphered disks. Do not give, for the time being, printed or photographed material. Keep the materials which you can justify keeping until we agree that you can deliver them.-Keep up the measure of formatting the disks we send you with couriers or letters as soon as possible, leaving conventional notes as reminders only of those things to reply to or report.

      The message goes on to refer to a "shipment" that contains "Disk 'S1'-to cipher the information you send," and, as indicated in the previous section, to "Disk 'R1' to decipher our mailings and radio." Earlier in the message, there is a reference to "information you receive either via radio or disk."

      During the court-authorized search of the residence on 25 May 2001, two boxes containing a total of 16 diskettes were observed. During a subsequent search on 8 August 2001, a box containing 41 diskettes, later determined to be blank, were observed. Finally, records obtained from a Radio Shack store located near Montes's residence indicated that Montes purchased 160 floppy diskettes during the period 1 May 1993 to 2 November 1997.

      Communication from Montes to the CuIS by Pager5

      On the basis of the evidence, Montes communicated with her handling CuIS officer using a pager. In the same message copied from Montes's hard drive, there is a passage that states:

      Beepers that you have. The only beepers in use at present are the following: 1) (917) [first seven-digit telephone number omitted from this application], use it with identification code 635. 2) (917) [second seven-digit telephone number omitted from this application]. Use it with identification code 937. 3) (917) [third seven-digit telephone number omitted from this application] Use it only with identification code 2900 . . . because this beeper is public, in other words it is known to belong to the Cuban Mission at the UN and we assume there is some control over it. You may use this beeper only in the event you cannot communicate with those mentioned in 1) and 2), which are secure.

      The reference to "control over it" in the above passage refers to the CuIS officer's suspicion that the FBI is aware that this beeper number is associated with the Cuban Government and is monitoring it in some fashion.

      In addition, the message on the laptop's hard drive includes a portion stating that the message recipient "entered the code communicating that you were having problems with radio reception." This portion of the message indicates that Montes at some point shortly prior to receiving the message sent a page to her CuIS officer handler consisting of a preassigned series of numbers to indicate she was having communication problems.

      Montes's Transmission of Classified Information to the CuIS

      The same message described above, as well as other messages recovered from the laptop's hard drive, contained the following information indicating that Montes had been tasked to provide and did provide classified information to the CuIS. In one portion of the message discussed above, the CuIS officer states:

      What ***6 said during the meeting . . . was very interesting. Surely you remember well his plans and expectations when he was coming here. If I remember right, on that occasion, we told you how tremendously useful the information you gave us from the meetings with him resulted, and how we were waiting here for him with open arms.

      The very next section in the message states:

      We think the opportunity you will have to participate in the ACOM exercise in December is very good. Practically, everything that takes place there will be of intelligence value. Let's see if it deals with contingency plans and specific targets in Cuba, which are to prioritized interests for us.

      The "ACOM exercise in December" is a reference to a war games exercise in December 1996 conducted by the US Atlantic Command-a US Department of Defense unified command, in Norfolk, Virginia. Details about the exercise's "contingency plans and specific targets" is classified Secret and relates to the national defense of the United States. DIA advised that Montes attended the above exercise in Norfolk as part of her official DIA duties.

      A separate message partially recovered from the hard drive of Montes's Toshiba laptop revealed details about a particular Special Access Program (SAP) related to the national defense of the United States:

      In addition, just today the agency made me enter into a program, "special access top secret. [First name and last name omitted from this application] and I are the only ones in my office who know about the program." [The details related about this SAP in this message are classified "Top Secret" / SCI.]

      DIA has confirmed that Montes and a colleague with the same name as that related in the portion of the message described above were briefed into this SAP on 15 May 1997.

      In yet another message recovered from the laptop, there is a statement revealing that "we have noticed" the location, number, and type of certain Cuban military weapons in Cuba. This information is precisely the type of information that was within Montes's area of expertise and was, in fact, an accurate statement of the US Intelligence Community's knowledge on this particular issue. The information is classified Secret.

      FBI Physical Surveillance of Montes and Telephone Records for May to September

      The FBI maintained periodic physical surveillance of Montes during the period May to September 2001. On 20 May 2001, Montes left her residence and drove to the Hecht's on Wisconsin Avenue, in Chevy Chase, Maryland. She entered the store at 1:07 p.m. and exited by the rear entrance at 1:27 p.m. She then sat down on a stonewall outside the rear entrance and waited for approximately two minutes. At 1:30 p.m., the FBI observed her walk to a pay phone approximately 20 feet from where she was sitting. She placed a one-minute call to a pager number using a prepaid calling card. At 1:45 p.m., she drove out of the Hecht's lot and headed north on Wisconsin Avenue toward Bethesda, Maryland. At 1:52 p.m., she parked her car in a lot and went into Modell's Sporting Goods store. She quickly exited the store carrying a bag and crossed Wisconsin Avenue to an Exxon station. She was observed looking over her right and left shoulders as she crossed the Exxon lot. At 2:00 p.m., she placed a one-minute call from a pay phone at the Exxon station to the same pager number using the same prepaid calling card. By 2:08 p.m., Montes had walked back to her vehicle and was driving back to her residence where she arrived at 2:30 p.m.

      On 3 June 2001, Montes engaged in similar communications activity. She left her residence at approximately 2:30 p.m. and drove to a bank parking lot at the corner of Harrison Street, NW and Wisconsin Avenue, NW. She exited her car at approximately 2:37 p.m. and entered a Borders books store on Wisconsin Avenue. She left the store approximately 40 minutes later. She then crossed Wisconsin Avenue to the vicinity of three public pay phones near the southern exit of the Friendship Heights Metro Station. At 3:28 p.m., she placed a one-minute call using the same prepaid calling card to the same pager number she had called on 20 May 2001. After a few minutes, she walked back to her car and drove to a grocery store.

      Pursuant to court authorization, on 16 August 2001, the FBI searched Montes's pocketbook. In a separate compartment of Montes's wallet, the FBI found the prepaid calling card used to place the calls on 20 May 2001 and 3 June 2001. In the same small compartment, the FBI located a slip of paper on which was written the pager number she had called. Written above this pager number was a set of digits, which comprised one or more codes for Montes to use after calling the pager number; for example, after contacting the pager, she keys in a code to be sent to the pager which communicates a particular pre-established message.

      On 26 August 2001, at approximately 10:00 a.m., the FBI observed Montes making a brief pay telephone call to the same pager number from a gas station/convenience store located at the intersection of Connecticut and Nebraska Avenues, NW in Washington, DC.

      On September 14, 2001, Montes left work and drove directly to her residence. She then walked to Connecticut Avenue, NW, in Washington, D.C., still wearing her business clothes, and made a stop at a dry cleaning shop. She then entered the National Zoo through the Connecticut Avenue entrance. She proceeded to the "Prairie Land" overlook where she stayed for only 30 seconds. She then walked further into the zoo compound and basically retraced her route out of the zoo. At approximately 6:30 p.m., Montes removed a small piece of paper or card from her wallet and walked to a public phone booth located just outside the pedestrian entrance to the zoo. Montes then made what telephone records confirmed to be two calls to the same pager number she had called in May, June, and August, as described above. The records reflect that the first call was unsuccessful-the call lasted zero seconds. According to the records, she made a second call one minute later that lasted 33 seconds. Shortly after making these calls, Montes looked at her watch and then proceeded to walk back to her residence.

      On 15 September 2001, telephone records pertaining to the prepaid calling card number on the card observed in her pocketbook on 16 August 2001 showed that Montes made a call to the same pager number at 11:12 a.m. that lasted one minute.

      The next day-16 September-Montes left her residence in the early afternoon and took the Metro (Red Line) to the Van Ness-UDC station in Washington, DC. She made a brief telephone call from a payphone in the Metro station at approximately 1:50 p.m., again to the same pager number.

      Montes owned a cell phone, which was observed during a court-authorized search of her tote bag on 16 August 2001. In addition, during surveillance on 16 September 2001, Montes was observed speaking on a cell phone. Furthermore, telephone records obtained in May 2001 confirm that she has subscribed to cell telephone service continually from 26 October 1996 to 14 May 2001. Montes's use of public pay phones notwithstanding her access to a cell phone supports the conclusion that the pay phone calls were in furtherance of Montes's espionage.

      On 19 March 2002, Montes pleaded guilty to espionage in U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, and admitted that, for 16 years, she had passed top secret information to Cuban intelligence. She used shortwave radios, encrypted transmissions, and a pay telephone to contact Cuban intelligence officials and provide them the names of four US intelligence officers working in Cuba. She also informed Cuban intelligence about a US "special access program" and revealed that the US Government had uncovered the location of various Cuban military installations.

      Both her defense attorney and federal prosecutors said that Montes was motivated by her moral outrage at US policy toward Cuba-an impoverished island country-and not by money. She received only "nominal" expenses for her activities.

      Although Montes could receive the death penalty for her crime, the plea agreement calls for a 25year prison term if she cooperates with the FBI and other investigators by providing all the details she knows about Cuban intelligence activities. Judge Ricardo M. Urbina set a sentencing date of September 2002.

      Endnotes

      1 A receipt obtained from a CompUSA store located in Alexandria, Virginia, indicated that, on 5 October 1996, one "Ana B. Montes" purchased a refurbished Toshiba laptop computer, model 405CS, serial number 10568512. The Toshiba laptop in her apartment had the same serial number on it as the one she purchased.

      2 The CuIS often communicates with clandestine CuIS agents operating outside Cuba by broadcasting encrypted messages at certain high frequencies. Under this method, the CuIS broadcasts a series of numbers on a particular frequency. The clandestine agent, monitoring the message on a shortwave radio, keys in the numbers onto a computer and then uses a diskette containing a decryption program to convert the seemingly random series of numbers into Spanish- language text. This was the methodology employed by some of the defendants convicted last June in the Southern District of Florida of espionage on behalf of Cuba and acting as unregistered agents of Cuba, in the case of United States of America v. Gerardo Hernandez, et al. (See Cuban Spies in Miami). Although it is very difficult to decrypt a message without access to the relevant decryption program, once decrypted on the agent's computer the decrypted message resides on the computer's hard drive unless the agent takes careful steps to cleanse the hard drive of the message. Simply "deleting" the file is not sufficient.

      3 Similar earpieces were found in the residences of the defendants in the Hernandez case.

      4 On the basis of knowledge of the methodology employed by the CuIS, a clandestine CuIS agent often communicates with his or her handling CuIS officer by typing a message onto a computer and then encrypting and saving it to a diskette. The agent, thereafter, physically delivers the diskette, either directly or indirectly, to the officer. In addition, as an alternative to sending an encrypted shortwave radio broadcast, a CuIS officer often will similarly place an encrypted message onto a diskette and again simply physically deliver the diskette, clandestinely, to the agent. Upon receipt of the encrypted message, either by the CuIS officer or the agent, the recipient employs a decryption program contained on a separate diskette to decrypt the message. The exchange of diskettes containing encrypted messages, and the use of decryption programs contained on separate diskettes, was one of the clandestine communication techniques utilized by the defendants in the Hernandez case. Although it is difficult to decrypt a message without the decryption program, the very process of encrypting or decrypting a message on a computer causes a decrypted copy of the message to be placed on the computer's hard drive. Unless affirmative steps are taken to cleanse the hard drive-beyond simply "deleting" the message-the message can be retrieved from the hard drive.

      5 On the basis of knowledge of the methodology employed by the CuIS, a clandestine CuIS agent often communicates with his or her handling CuIS officer by making calls to a pager number from a pay telephone booth and entering a preassigned code to convey a particular message. The defendants in the Hernandez case also utilized this methodology.

      6 The FBI replaced in this application with "***" a word that begins with a capital letter, which was not translated, and is, in fact, the true last name of a US intelligence officer who was present in an undercover capacity, in Cuba, during a period that began prior to October 1996. The above quoted portion of the message indicates that Montes disclosed the US officer's intelligence agency affiliation and anticipated presence in Cuba to the CuIS, which information is classified "Secret." As a result, the Cuban Government was able to direct its counterintelligence resources against the US officer ("we were waiting here for him with open arms").




      Ana Belen Montes' residence was a cooperative apartment located at 3039 Macomb St, N.W., apartment 20, Washington, D.C. Room C6-146A, 200 MacDill Boulevard, Washington, DC was the office/work space assigned to Ana Belen Montes, at the Defense Intelligence Analysis Center, located on Bolling Air Force Base. 

      She is a United States citizen, born on February 28, 1957, on a U.S. military installation in Nurnberg, Germany. Montes graduated from the University of Virginia, 1979 and obtained a masters degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, 1988.

      She was employed at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as a senior intelligence analyst, since September 1985. Since 1992, she was specialized in Cuba matters. Montes was the senior analyst responsible for matters pertaining Cuba. Montes had direct and authorized access to classified information relating to the national defense.

      The Cuban Intelligence Service ( CuIS) communicates with clandestine CuIS agents operating outside Cuba by broadcasting encrypted messages at certain high frequencies. Under this method, the CuIS broadcasts on a particular frequency a series of numbers. The clandestine agent, monitoring the message on a short wave radio, keys in the numbers onto a computer and then uses a diskette containing a decryption program to convert the seemingly random series of numbers into Spanish-language text. Typical messages consists of a series of 150 5-numbers groups, like "30107 24624".

      This was the methodology employed by some of the spies convicted, in the Southern District of Florida, of espionage on behalf of Cuba. Montes was a clandestine CuIS agent who communicated with her handling CuIS officer in the manner described above. Montes had a Toshiba laptop computer, model 405CS to that effect.

      Montes also had a Sony shortwave radio stored in a box in her apartment. She had an earpiece that could be utilized with this shortwave radio, allowing the radio to be listened to more privately. Similar earpieces were found in the residences of the Cuban spies in Miami.

      CuIS agents also communicate with her or his handling CuIS officer by making calls to a pager number from a pay telephone booth and entering a pre-assigned code to convey a particular message. This methodology was utilized by Ana Belen Montes as well as by the spies convicted in South Florida.
      Espionage paraphernalia, including devices designed to conceal and transmit national defense and classified intelligence information and material, and implements used by espionage agents to communicate with their handlers and with a foreign government, to wit: white tape, mailing tape, colored chalk ( all used for signaling purposes), coded pads, secret writing paper, microdots, any letters, notes or other written communications ( including contact instructions) between Montes and any agents of the CuIS or other intelligence service of Cuba; any computers, computer disks, cameras, films, codes, telephone numbers, maps, photographs and other materials relating to communication procedures.


      CUBA REPRESENTS A DANGEROUS AND SERIOUS THREAT TO THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES AND LATIN AMERICA.


      APPENDIX 


      EXCERPTS FROM A TAPED BRIEFING WITH ANA BELEN MONTES. THE TWO PARTICIPATING REPORTERS I HAVE NAMED XXX, YYY.




      BRIEFING WITH DEPT. OF INTELLIGENCE

      DATE: JUNE 4, 1997 


      Maybe for the tape we could just review that I am Colonel JJJfrom the Department of Intelligence's (DI) public Affairs Office. We are here to do a background interview generally speaking on the topic of Cuba. It's a background briefing and any attribution would be for a senior defense official and maybe we should just go around the room and you could state your name:

      My name is: Ana Montes,

      XXX, YYY

      Colonel :Ok, so what's your interest?

      YYY: Well, a number of areas--but I was in Cuba this weekend and Bob and I have been working on many issues, but specifically, on Cuba's capabilities on the area of biological warfare ("BW") on whether they have any capability in that arena or could rapidly develop such a capability.

      Specially in light of what they have been saying about us over the last month which strikes us as very bizarre. They are offering us access to their fields, access to crops____ and also offering access to laboratories and I mean first of all it struck us completely out of left field--when you saw it- I was in Burbank, and I said, wait until you see this....and you know, why now? why this?--maybe that's a good starting point- I mean--- what has evolved as to why they are now accusing the US of biological weapons?


      COLONEL: This is not the first time. The history goes back to 1981. It deals with Dengue Fever accusations-- unfounded. Frankly, we always felt-- (again this is general sense of comparison) ---that their presence in other parts of the world, supporting Angola... and otherwise, really brought that and probably Conjunctivitis back to Cuba and then conveniently claims were made that this was somehow a biological warfare attack by the U.S. which was totally absurd. So this is a continuing thing...

      But they haven't made anything recently?

      Col No. There hasn't been any news about anything since that time period until very recently until the State Dept. aircraft incident. So everything has been sort of quite in that sense. So the accusations are there and we kind of shake our heads whenever they are made---because some of them are so bizarre ---you find with the case with the infestation that is happening in the general region and not just Cuba. But the State Dept. answered their questions.

      XXX: But is there any particular reason why now? Is there anything that you guys can look at and say this is the reason or that is the reason? It's been basically 14 years. I remember when the retired General Wilhelm ? went to that Senator Defense Information trip in 1994 -- and they were screaming about the US and and they cut him off...and said that the Miami Cubans... and suddenly the conversation ended--- and that appeared to me that they were lowering the temperature of the subject. And suddenly you know, this comes out of nowhere.

      DI It's really hard to know...I can tell you from our standpoint..we don't see any any reason again from the standpoint of their perception of "BW" or whatever, why this should come up at this time. We monitor them, look at their country, and off course, are deeply interested in their capabilities, but there is nothing out of the ordinary which seems to have been the provocatour (if indeed, there is a reason that is the genesis of this or the nexxus of it) but it may not be -- it may just be a coincidence and maybe grabbed on to Castro for no reasons. Whether they are well thought of or not is also possibly an opportunity-- coincidental with an aircraft flying over and having a problem with a crop and 1 + 1 =2. And why not go back and bring this up again. Again nothing that we can say.

      YYY: On the other side of the ledger, there have been over the last 20 years a proliferation of scientific institutes (Biotech Center, Institute of Tropical Center, The Finley Institute, The Geographic Institute + 10 others etc..) And I am told that even the institutions have declared for BL/ 3 BL4 facility declarations which give them a capability of .....


      DI: Oh, you bet!. You don't even necessarily need a BL 4 capability to undertake that type of program......but it dosen't hurt..and it reflects..the fact is, just to get to the heart of it--what you said is essentially totally correct about that their biotechnology industry in many areas is equivalent (and certainly not across the whole spectrum-- but in many areas) equivalent to 1st world levels and they have some projects that certainly reflect significant advanced potential and certainly the Institute for Biotechnology in Havana is a good indicator of their capabilty for research projects They claim for instance, they are working on HIV, they produce vaccines, pharmaceuticals..

      YYY: About 100 million dollars worth of exports?

      DI: In fact, Castro favors, the biotech industry. He has personal interest in it. So, from a standpoint unlike that of many other countries we look at them from a 1st world capability- Cuba has all of the necessary ingridients to accomplish a BW effort if they would choose to do so. But, if that's their intention---(which I can not discuss the details relating to that), but if so, the infrastructure affords them that potential. 

      YYY: Are there any indications of their intentions?

      DI I can't really go into that at all. Probably can't give any more details about that unfortunately.

      YYY: When we talk to other people, in other places in the government, they claim-- well, that the Cuban military does not do biological training. You know, their gas masks are a disaster, they have not replenished them which leads me to either one of two possiblities: a.) There is no program. or b.) There is a program, but outside the traditional military realm-- sort of a "dooms day". 

      DI Certainly all that is possible. The one general statement that I would make about biological intentions is that the very fact whether the capability for physicial protection or medical protection exists or does not exist, is not a primary requisite for an offense of capabilty, so, it doesn't necessarily (not just talking about Cuba but in the general sense) that its not even-- depending on how one would choose to affect a BW operation- you do not necessarily have to have your troops vaccinated or protected because in many senses, BW would be looked-- and is looked at- as less of a tactical capability and more of a strategic capability to be delivered upon someone else's territory rather than yours.


      YYY: Has he--now he apparently said something recently that was somewhat ambigous in this area-- (I have a head cold, I don't know if I have some personal BW--or clouding of the mind)...He recently made a statement that the Miami Cubans had seized upon as an indicator that he's got something going----Is there anything that strikes a cord with you in the last month or two?

      DI Nothing that we've seen. We have seen the articles regarding the accusations about "Germ weapons and missiles" and frankly we do not put much credibility to that type of statement.

      YYY: This was said by a formal Colonel?

      DI Yes, and at this point it just doesn't add up- and 2 and 2 doesn't make 4. And so we just don't pay too much credibility to this.

      YYY: Is there any public statement that he's ever made that has caused you any concern in this area?

      DI Not really a public statement per se, no no. Our area of concern relates to his general "unfriendliness towards the US and his interest in biological (albeit)---and certainly civilan sector capabilities" which would be our concerns and also his potentials. Whenever a leader which such immense control takes a personal interest in an area that can have that potential, then our antena is of course raised and we are watching. Certainly, they are close to our borders and with the advanced capabilities this is something that we watch, but then again, off course, we watch many, many other countries that have this potential.

      YYY: Now they are a signatory to the BW _______ 
      When I look at the active reports, the full? reports there is no mention of . What is that an indicator of?

      DI: Well, at this point I really wouldn't like to try to read into the State Department does--and a ____ _ _? So I really do do want to comment on to why is there or not there.

      DI: There are a lot of signatories that are mentioned that you probably see that are mentioned that

      YYY: Yes, but there are some that are signatories that are mentioned as having programs or in wonderfully lithical diplomatic language Egypt, Taiwan, 

      Di: Yes, Syria, China.

      YYY: But those are less of a pickle?

      Di: Yes.

      YYY: Right. I mean, Egypt and Taiwan I thought were particularly ____?

      Di Yes, they really are. I really can't answer that in either in an affirmative or negative why they were or were not included in that section.

      YYY: I've got a couple of specific things that I've been thinking about-- within the last 24 hours people have been telling me-- and obviously, it is disturbing what I've been told because of the local of the southern extreme of the United States and the access with which it can reach us and --level of outrage, the point was there is a defector who came here two or three years ago, he is a physician who worked at a biotech center and claims that a toxin, (a para___ toxin) was being developed with the aid of a Japanese company--- you're nodding?

      DI: I am familiar with the information, and really can't comment on that. We have looked at that closely and we have assessments but it gets into areas that I really would not want to try to provide.

      YYY: Let me see if I can--would it be worthwhile for us to talk to this guy?

      DI: My sense is that the way we always look at intelligence is that if you look at a single source, as such, it could be very misleading-- that's why I can't go on anything because it brings up textual information and if we say that we agree-- that he is valuable or not valuable- it brings up other information that I can't go into which would corroborate or not corroborate with saying. So, you're on your own!

      YYY: Laughs, Ok., Well, I've also heard that there is a Naval Hospital in Havana-- have your interests?

      DI: Yes,-continually, we see again coming mostly from the so-called, "free Cubans"-- a lot of information that comes out- I can't characterize any one bit of that information as plus or minus, but I will say that classically most of the information that comes from that sector is more based on a tidbit of information that then becomes strapulated beyond what would be reasonable. It is very hard to find anything that you can actually corroborate. You have a data point and when you try to follow some of these data points they become simply something that just goes into thin air. There is nothing to base it on.


      YYY: Is this because Cuba is such a difficult intelligence target or is it because the information is almost always wrong?

      DI: Oh no, no, I would not even characterize it either way, difficult or not difficult or whatever. It's just that the information that comes from that sector doesn't help us necessarily-- in terms of accessing if Cuba has a capability or not. We've never seen were that's been tied.

      YYY: Do you look for imports or parts of equipment.

      DI: We watch everything.

      YYY: Great. You have 3 - Flash-4 facility being one--- fermentors?

      DI: Yes.

      YYY: Large scale fermentors?

      DI: Absolutely .

      YYY: Right. Small to large.

      DI: Very minor dual use.

      YYY: And then everything biological is dual use--as someone pointed out to me, if you look at nuclear, chemical and biological-- I mean, nuclear there is a small part which is dual use and a larger part which is military use- chemicals get a little more confusing- biological is hopeless.

      DI: Pretty much although there exists (again not solely related or not related to Cuba with the Australian group) and they have been fairly successful (and we have supported the Australian group quite a bit, the US has) in trying to define that material that could lend itself to BW programing. Interestingly, again this is just background on BW and not Cuba, but pretty much when you look at it if you look at the genesis of the BW programming, it is strictly an offensive program what you are going to find is that -you are going to find an R&amp;D effort dealing with agents and pretty much when you're looking at agents it becomes very difficult to ascertain whether the program is going to actually split off in a "Y" towards defensive or commercial sector vs. Strictly offensive. But there are notes that exist-and the fact is that in the early phase it is virtually impossible to discriminate between the two. However, with the Australia group, you set certain limits as to the size of fermenters for instance that would be construed as being beyond that necessary for a normal pharmaceutical or commercial sector.


      YYY: In kilograms or--

      Di: No, liters (volumes)

      YYY: What's that 150?

      Di: It keeps going back and forth and right now, 150 is a good number. Which a piot is about 50 to 70 where he sort of grilling it up sort of speak, getting ready to pour it into something to make it larger. And that's starting off at 150, but when you are in large scale productions, what's practical is about 1500 liters or so.--and that's for a full capability.

      ? But you wouldn't need large scale capability.

      ? You don't need it.

      YYY: Right. But they have them.

      DI: Yes. And so as a consequence something they might have is smaller size fermentor. Which we would call pilot which could in fact lend itself to the production of enough biological agents (mainly talking about infectious agents right now, not toxins which are bi-products of other organisms) but with infectious agents. You can also---you can believe or not, grow biological agents in flasks and just have many, many, many flasks-- and that can give you the capability of producing enough agents, it doesn't take a lot of organisms to cause infections

      YYY: There are certain parts of organisms too.

      DI: That is correct. There are literally--from a military standpoint- a very effective military effort-the way we look at biological is that first of all generally, (and again not bioterrorism or low intensive conflict) but more military-- you try to look at an agent that is not --because you are looking at hitting the individual causing the effect and moving on. You do not want an epidemic. From a military standpoint that becomes a logistical nightmare. That's why Anthrax, botulin toxin also sit on the top of anyone's list. 

      YYY: What about BEE and things like that.

      Di: Yeah, BEE again, that's a little more difficult virus to grow up and it takes more sophistication. But BEE certainly is a prom candidate and any of the ______group viruses and Middle Eastern Bee.

      YYY: Any about Rheumatic fever?

      Di: Rheumatic fever viruses are more difficult---the futility has yet to be demonstrated. You are working with not necessarily highly contagious viruses because--- if they were.. 

      YYY: We would be dead!

      Di: ....the good news is that they would kill their host very rapidly and not spread on. And plus they are not spread throughout the aerosol or respiratory---for example you have a renal virus right now, probably an upper respiratory virus...

      YYY: I sure do.

      Di: And you are more contagious- depending if you are in the incubation period, how long have you had it? 

      YYY: I'm at the end of it. 

      DI: You are not in the incubation stage right now--you have Blue Cross and Blue Shield?
      But actually what you produce in the early or incubation stages are called filmates and they are particles of sputum. It is a highly contagious virus but of the most biological are not readily contagious. If you wanted to try to get Anthrax you have to literally get down and touch the patient and get right in their face. 

      YYY: Well that's where military _______

      DI: Well, again, it depends on the goals-- and if you want to start certainly an epidemic, there might be some agents that you can pick up. For the most part when you get into agents that cause epidemics they are very hard to grow, they are hard to manage and to keep confined. So generally, they are not picked because they are just to hard to work with.

      YYY: When you look at the various facilities, I'm assuming that the Biotech and Genetic Engineering is on the top of your list of things to look at and to watch. Are there others?

      DI: Well we watch---there are more than a dozen or so key facilities and we watch them. Absolutely. We watch the whole Cuba capability very closely.

      YYY: Is your work at the biotech center based on its large capacity, its large numbers of people, its large fermenters and it being a flash 4 facility--is it that primarily that gets you nervous or is it the fact that they have genetic engineering capabilities?

      Di: Well, really, the first level of concern is with the technical infrastructure and that would lend itself. The genetic engineering portion, for the most, if you look at biological warfare in general, it is area, that again, that we are watching, following, but we've accessed that any country developing a BW capability first With what is familiar to them Is classical- so genetic engineering is certainly something we have our eye on cause we are always ready for intervention. But for the most, our major concerns______

      YYY: Does the Institute of Tropical Medicine interest you?

      Di: They all do.

      YYY: Ed and I spent a wonderful day when we met with the special troops- the Red Berets in Pinar Del Rio. Does that interest you in this area?

      DI: Ah, not any more, I would say that I characterize it as....not any more than the whole capability of looking at the country in total. I can't really go on focusing on any one specific element just to see if we have interest or not--we look at the country in total and its capabilities.

      YYY So with the capabilities you are talking are the whole "Bio" ---.

      DI: The whole bio capabilities, yes. What I was going to say in terms of us looking at the capability is when that juncture occurs that I was speaking about, that's a very interesting point with BW because when a country decides to go towards weaponization- you can see a scale of capabilities it's not indicative of legitimate commercial. Nothing Cuba is doing at all--.A large scale of production and any relationships, any concerns that they could just be just scaling off-- which would not be consistent with the BWC.

      YYY: Have you seen any of that?

      DI: I can't talk about that.

      YYY: I am also told that during the first two years of the Clinton administration, you guys prepared two reports on Cuba's BW. Is that an accurate statement?


      DI: We prepared several reports, not on Cuba BW but on Cuba as part of the world-- if you look at it. We were constantly preparing reports accessing the general capabilities of again, many countries so to say specifically, Cuba I can't speak to that. When we look at lots of countries and its fair to say that whether its positive or negative again, I won't characterize Cuba as having a BW program, but I'll say that we follow it and we do prepare reports and access what their capabilities are.



      YYY: Has there been any other analysis of the shoot down that would indicate that on that particular day that the order came directly from Fidel or Raul because continuously, they have given us the impression that it was their defense officer who had standing instructions to order the shoot down. But do you know anything more now about what happened?

      Montes: That is our understanding as well. That this was a standing order -this was a decision which had been made weeks before.

      YYY: A standing order?

      Montes: Right, a standing order.

      YYY: And nobody called Fidel and said, "Ok their out there....

      Montes: Not as far as I know.

      YYY: Is the air Marshall still around?

      Montes: The air Marshall?

      YYY: The person who ordered the shoot down on that particular day.

      Montes: We have had no indication of any changes in command whatsoever, to the contrary.

      YYY: What's the contrary?

      Montes: That the pilots themselves were highly praised and glorified within the military for what they had done and that the entire chain used congratulatory comments.

      YYY: So there was only one--except---

      Montes: Well, some instances of mistakes that might have been made. You know, technically/ tactically. But not the final outcome. The final outcome was much desired, much welcome by the higher military.



      YYY: We were amazed when we were done there cause we flew in on morning after the shoot down that they did not have, the political types did not have, any sort of coordinated strategy or coordinated response. I mean we had breakfast with Alarcon that Tuesday morning. That Tuesday morning, and it was like--we kept waiting for them to say-- well off course we were able to determine that the planes were headed from Playa Baracoa and you know, Fidel was there or something. You know, some justification and there just wasn't anything of any--you know..

      Montes: I'm just saying that the military knew about this and they knew about it ahead of time-- and they knew this was coming down ahead of time. This was a military operation that they planned and it wasn't quite examinated by the political elite.

      YYY: So what was the tactical mistake?

      Montes: Problems with equipment, mistakes primarily made by equipment, they did not function as it was expected to function. Pieces of equipment that did not function as it was expected to function.

      YYY: So on the actual report it was technical (subheadings). And they knew because of Roque?

      Montes: That's what we suspect- in part. In part.

      YYY: We had a very funny experience with Roque. He took out his little diary or phone book and he was showing us he that had the names of the FBI agent, you know, and the cell phone number to show me that he had made contacts with the FBI agent and then he was showing it to Ed and then he dropped it and when he dropped it we noted that there was not another entry in the entire book so this must have been a very important source because it was the only source. Everything was very well printed in that one page.

      Montes: Did he tell you that he had been working for the Cuban Government from the beginning--that when he defected he was already a spy for the Cuban government? What did he say?

      YYY: No, No. He said that he had changed his mind.

      Montes: Changed his mind.



      AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF CRIMINAL COMPLAINT,
      ARREST WARRANT, AND SEARCH WARRANTS

      national defense.

      6. Records obtained from Riggs Bank reveal that MONTES has continually leased safe
      deposit box number 526 at Riggs Bank, N.A., Friendship Branch, 4249 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W.,
      Washington, D.C. since September 2, 1993.

      7. Classified information is defined by Executive Order No. 12,958, 60 Fed. Reg.19,825
      (1995), as follows: information in any form that (1) is owned by, produced by or for, or under the
      control of the United States government; (2) falls within one or more of the categories set forth in
      section 1.5 of the order (including intelligence sources and methods, cryptology, military plans, and
      vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or plans relating to the national
      security), and (3) is classified by an original classification authority who determines that its
      unauthorized disclosure reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security.
      Under the executive order, the designation "Confidential" shall be applied to information, the
      unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national
      security. The designation "Secret" shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of
      which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security. The
      designation "Top Secret" shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which
      reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.
      8. In addition, Executive Order No. 12,958 provides that the secretaries of State, Defense and
      Energy are authorized to create "special access programs" upon certain specific findings including
      that the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific classified information is exceptional. Under such a
      -4-
      program, the safeguarding and access requirements to information covered by the program exceed
      those normally required for information at the same classification level.
      9. Under 32 C.F.R. § 159a.9, Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) refers to
      information and material that requires special controls for restricted handling.

      10. During her employment at DIA, MONTES has continuously held a security clearance and
      has had regular, authorized access to classified information. I know that a person who receives such
      clearances is required to be briefed on the procedures for properly handling classified information
      and the penalties for failing to do so, and that such a person must sign certifications of understanding
      and agreement in connection with those briefings. I have reviewed a "Classified Information
      Nondisclosure Agreement" (Standard Form 189) that MONTES signed on September 30, 1985. In
      that document MONTES acknowledged that she was aware that unauthorized disclosure of classified
      information could cause irreparable injury to the United States or could be used to advantage by a
      foreign nation, that she would never divulge such information to an unauthorized person, and that
      she understood that she was obligated to comply with laws and regulations that prohibit the
      unauthorized disclosure of classified information, and that she further understood such a disclosure
      could constitute a violation of United States criminal law including 18 U.S.C. § 794. I have also
      reviewed a "Security Briefing/Debriefing Acknowledgment" form signed by MONTES on May 15,
      1997, briefing her into a Special Access Program (SAP). On this date, specifically in connection
      with this SAP, MONTES signed a Sensitive Compartmented Information Nondisclosure Agreement,
      in which she acknowledged that the unauthorized disclosure of SCI may violate federal criminal law,
      including 18 U.S.C. § 794, and that such disclosure could cause irreparable injury to the United
      States or be used to the advantage of a foreign nation.

      II. MONTES's Toshiba Laptop Computer and Shortwave Radio
      A. Communication From the Cuban Intelligence Service (CuIS) to MONTES via
      Shortwave Radio

      11. Based on my knowledge and familiarity with the methodology of the Cuban intelligence
      service, I am aware that the CuIS often communicates with clandestine CuIS agents operating
      outside Cuba by broadcasting encrypted messages at certain high frequencies. Under this method,
      the CuIS broadcasts on a particular frequency a series of numbers. The clandestine agent,
      monitoring the message on a shortwave radio, keys in the numbers onto a computer and then uses
      a diskette containing a decryption program to convert the seemingly random series of numbers into
      Spanish-language text. This was the methodology employed by some of the defendants convicted
      last June in the Southern District of Florida of espionage on behalf of Cuba and acting as
      unregistered agents of Cuba, in the case of United States of America v. Gerardo Hernandez, et al.,
      Cr. No. 98-721-CR-Lenard(s)(s). Although it is very difficult to decrypt a message without access
      to the relevant decryption program, once decrypted on the agent's computer the decrypted message
      resides on the computer's hard drive unless the agent takes careful steps to cleanse the hard drive of
      the message. Simply "deleting" the file is not sufficient.

      12. Based on the evidence described below, I have concluded that MONTES was a
      clandestine CuIS agent who communicated with her handling CuIS officer in the manner described
      above.

      13. A receipt obtained from a CompUSA store located in Alexandria, Virginia indicated that
      on October 5, 1996, one "Ana B. Montes" purchased a refurbished Toshiba laptop computer, model
      405CS, serial number 10568512.
      -6-

      14. During a court-authorized surreptitious entry into MONTES's residence, conducted by
      the FBI on May 25, 2001, FBI agents observed in her residence a Toshiba laptop computer with the
      serial number set out above. During the search, the agents electronically copied the laptop's hard
      drive. During subsequent analysis of the copied hard drive, the FBI recovered substantial text that
      had been deleted from the laptop's hard drive.

      15. The recovered text from the laptop's hard drive included significant portions of a Spanishlanguage
      message, which when printed out with standard font comes to approximately 11 pages of
      text. The recovered portion of the message does not expressly indicate when it was composed.
      However, it instructs the message recipient to travel to "the Friendship Heights station" on "Saturday,
      November 23rd." My review of a calendar indicates that November 23 fell on a Saturday in 1996;
      the next time thereafter November 23 falls on a Saturday is in 2002. Accordingly, this message was
      composed sometime before November 23, 1996, and entered onto MONTES's laptop sometime after
      October 5, 1996, the date she purchased it. Based on its content, I have concluded that it is a
      message from a CuIS officer to MONTES.

      16. Portions of the recovered message included the following: "You should go to the WIPE
      program and destroy that file according to the steps which we discussed during the contact. This is
      a basic step to take every time you receive a radio message or some disk."
      17. During this same search, the agents also observed a Sony shortwave radio stored in a
      previously opened box on the floor of the bedroom. The agents turned on the radio to confirm that
      it was operable. Also found was an earpiece that could be utilized with this shortwave radio,
      allowing the radio to be listened to more privately. Similar earpieces were found in the residences
      of the defendants in the Hernandez case, as described above in paragraph 11.

      -7-
      18. The recovered portion of the message begins with the following passage:
      Nevertheless, I learned that you entered the code communicating that
      you were having problems with radio reception. The code alone
      covers a lot, meaning that we do not know specifically what types of
      difficulty you are having. Given that it's only been a few days since
      we began the use of new systems, let's not rule out that the problem
      might be related to them. In that case, I'm going to repeat the
      necessary steps to take in order to retrieve a message.

      The message then describes how the person reading the message should "write the information you
      send to us and the numbers of the radio messages which you receive." The message later refers to
      going "to a new line when you get to the group 10 of the numbers that you receive via radio," and
      still later gives as an "example" a series of groups of numbers: "22333 44444 77645 77647 90909
      13425 76490 78399 7865498534." After some further instruction, the message states: "Here the
      program deciphers the message and it retrie

An Appeal to organize a "WORKING CONFERENCE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE CUBAN 5!"
 
September 12, 2008 marks the 10th year of the arrest of five Cuban citizens – Fernando Gonzales, Rene Gonzalez, Antonio Guerrero, Ramon Labanino, Gerardo Hernandez –who were portrayed as "spies" and "murderers" in the service of "Castro's Cuba." They were tried and convicted in an atmosphere of hype and hysteria in Miami, Florida. The verdict was goaded by ultra-right politicians and a highly orchestrated media campaign of disinformation with the tone of a lynch mob. 
 
At the trial there was not a single page of classified information produced showing evidence of espionage or any action directed against the US government. The frame-up charges were packaged as a necessarily vague "conspiracy" to, as the prosecutor actually put it to the jury, "destroy the United States of America." In the period of 17 months between arrest and trial, the five Cubans were subjected to brutal conditions of solitary confinement and near-total isolation to hinder the preparation of their defense. This psychological torture was aimed at breaking their will, in blatant violation of their rights under US law. The hope was to break their spirit and force "confessions" to the trumped-up "conspiracy" charges. But this failed and the trial was finally held in November 2000. They were convicted in June 2001.
 
The truth is that the Cuban Five infiltrated ultra-right Cuban-American organizations, with a clear history of terrorist attacks organized on US soil against the sovereign Cuban state in violation of US law. Over 3,500 Cuban citizens have died in such attacks since the Cuban Revolution triumphed against the Batista dictatorship in 1959. Many tens of billions of dollars worth of damage have been done to the Cuban economy. These attacks stepped up in the mid-1990s as the Cuban economy reeled from an economic depression. Tourist hotels were bombed resulting in death and destruction. Low flying planes – originating from US territory in violation of US law – repeatedly violated Cuban airspace. Only after the Cuban government presented clear evidence of such terrorist and criminal activities and repeatedly implored, to no avail, the Clinton Administration to do something about it did the Cuban Five carry out its courageous and dangerous work which the record shows saved lives in Cuba.
 
Today, a panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering the range of egregious violations committed by the prosecution in the original trial. In August 2005 a panel from the same Appeals Court ruled, in a stunning decision with virtually no precedent, to overturn the original trial verdict on the grounds that there could not be a fair and impartial hearing in the hostile climate of Miami, Florida. This ruling was subsequently reversed by the full court under heavy pressure from the Bush Administration's Justice Department.
 
Around the world, and increasingly inside the United States, the case of the Cuban Five, stands as one of the most brutal and outrageous injustices in modern history. As the facts have emerged and the truth about the Cuban Five becomes more known and publicized, Committees to support the Cuban Five have spread all over the world. Their incarceration continues under brutal conditions that have included solitary confinement and denial of family visitations and other violations of formal US laws. 
 
 Washington is paying an increasing political price as this ongoing travesty of justice enters its second decade. On May 2005, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations issued a stinging exposure of the arbitrary and iniquitous nature of the trial and conviction. The UN body emphasized that the Cuban Five were held in solitary confinement for 17 months, weakening their ability to mount an adequate defense; that most of the evidence against them was withheld from their attorneys, undermining an equal balance between the prosecution and the defense; and that the trial was held in Miami where it was impossible to select an impartial jury in a case linked with Cuba.
 
On January 2006 Amnesty International condemned the Bush Administration and US authorities for the treatment of the Cuban Five, specifically for the denials of family visitation rights for some of the Cuban Five prisoners. 
 
 An international call for world protests in solidarity with the Cuban Five in September and October 2008 has been issued. Now is the time for all supporters of the Cuban Five and all supporters of civil liberties and justice to step up our work on their behalf. Now is the time to reach out to broad layers of the US population, whatever their political views in general and on the Cuban Revolution in particular. Supporters of the Cuban Five begin by demanding that US authorities comply with US law and allow family members to visit their loved ones. In this Presidential and Congressional election year we aim to raise the issue of the Cuban Five and to reach out and win support from elected officials.  To mark the 10th anniversary of their arrests there will be organized public protests on Saturday, September 13. Out of this activity we aim to build support for a National Conference in October 2008 in New York City to support of the Cuban Five.
 
In this spirit, activists in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are issuing this Appeal to Organize a Working Conference in Solidarity With the Cuban Five on Saturday, June 14, 2008. The Working Conference will be just that, a Working Conference, not a political rally or solely a gathering of already engaged and committed activists. We want this Working Conference to generate activity and concrete campaigns from the grass roots – from religious communities and organizations; from the trade union movement; from young people, students and the broader academic community; from African-American and Latino communities; from fighters for women's rights; from gay and lesbian rights organizations; from consistent advocates for civil liberties and constitutional rights; from artists and cultural workers. 
 
This is our challenge. This is our appeal. Now is the time. Please Join Us June 14!

Tourist hotels were bombed resulting in death and destruction. Low flying planes – originating from US territory in violation of US law – repeatedly violated Cuban airspace. Only after the Cuban government presented clear evidence of such terrorist and criminal activities and repeatedly implored, to no avail, the Clinton Administration to do something about it did the Cuban Five carry out its courageous and dangerous work which the record shows saved lives in Cuba.
 
Today, a panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering the range of egregious violations committed by the prosecution in the original trial. In August 2005 a panel from the same Appeals Court ruled, in a stunning decision with virtually no precedent, to overturn the original trial verdict on the grounds that there could not be a fair and impartial hearing in the hostile climate of Miami, Florida. This ruling was subsequently reversed by the full court under heavy pressure from the Bush Administration's Justice Department.
 
Around the world, and increasingly inside the United States, the case of the Cuban Five, stands as one of the most brutal and outrageous injustices in modern history. As the facts have emerged and the truth about the Cuban Five becomes more known and publicized, Committees to support the Cuban Five have spread all over the world. Their incarceration continues under brutal conditions that have included solitary confinement and denial of family visitations and other violations of formal US laws. 
 
 Washington is paying an increasing political price as this ongoing travesty of justice enters its second decade. On May 2005, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations issued a stinging exposure of the arbitrary and iniquitous nature of the trial and conviction. The UN body emphasized that the Cuban Five were held in solitary confinement for 17 months, weakening their ability to mount an adequate defense; that most of the evidence against them was withheld from their attorneys, undermining an equal balance between the prosecution and the defense; and that the trial was held in Miami where it was impossible to select an impartial jury in a case linked with Cuba.
 
On January 2006 Amnesty International condemned the Bush Administration and US authorities for the treatment of the Cuban Five, specifically for the denials of family visitation rights for some of the Cuban Five prisoners. 
 
 An international call for world protests in solidarity with the Cuban Five in September and October 2008 has been issued. Now is the time for all supporters of the Cuban Five and all supporters of civil liberties and justice to step up our work on their behalf. Now is the time to reach out to broad layers of the US population, whatever their political views in general and on the Cuban Revolution in particular. Supporters of the Cuban Five begin by demanding that US authorities comply with US law and allow family members to visit their loved ones. In this Presidential and Congressional election year we aim to raise the issue of the Cuban Five and to reach out and win support from elected officials.  To mark the 10th anniversary of their arrests there will be organized public protests on Saturday, September 13. Out of this activity we aim to build support for a National Conference in October 2008 in New York City to support of the Cuban Five.
 
In this spirit, activists in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are issuing this Appeal to Organize a Working Conference in Solidarity With the Cuban Five on Saturday, June 14, 2008. The Working Conference will be just that, a Working Conference, not a political rally or solely a gathering of already engaged and committed activists. We want this Working Conference to generate activity and concrete campaigns from the grass roots – from religious communities and organizations; from the trade union movement; from young people, students and the broader academic community; from African-American and Latino communities; from fighters for women's rights; from gay and lesbian rights organizations; from consistent advocates for civil liberties and constitutional rights; from artists and cultural workers. 
 
This is our challenge. This is our appeal. Now is the time. Please Join Us June 14!

An Appeal to organize a "WORKING CONFERENCE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE CUBAN 5!"
 
September 12, 2008 marks the 10th year of the arrest of five Cuban citizens – Fernando Gonzales, Rene Gonzalez, Antonio Guerrero, Ramon Labanino, Gerardo Hernandez –who were portrayed as "spies" and "murderers" in the service of "Castro's Cuba." They were tried and convicted in an atmosphere of hype and hysteria in Miami, Florida. The verdict was goaded by ultra-right politicians and a highly orchestrated media campaign of disinformation with the tone of a lynch mob. 
 
At the trial there was not a single page of classified information produced showing evidence of espionage or any action directed against the US government. The frame-up charges were packaged as a necessarily vague "conspiracy" to, as the prosecutor actually put it to the jury, "destroy the United States of America." In the period of 17 months between arrest and trial, the five Cubans were subjected to brutal conditions of solitary confinement and near-total isolation to hinder the preparation of their defense. This psychological torture was aimed at breaking their will, in blatant violation of their rights under US law. The hope was to break their spirit and force "confessions" to the trumped-up "conspiracy" charges. But this failed and the trial was finally held in November 2000. They were convicted in June 2001.
 
The truth is that the Cuban Five infiltrated ultra-right Cuban-American organizations, with a clear history of terrorist attacks organized on US soil against the sovereign Cuban state in violation of US law. Over 3,500 Cuban citizens have died in such attacks since the Cuban Revolution triumphed against the Batista dictatorship in 1959. Many tens of billions of dollars worth of damage have been done to the Cuban economy. These attacks stepped up in the mid-1990s as the Cuban economy reeled from an economic depression. Tourist hotels were bombed resulting in death and destruction. Low flying planes – originating from US territory in violation of US law – repeatedly violated Cuban airspace. Only after the Cuban government presented clear evidence of such terrorist and criminal activities and repeatedly implored, to no avail, the Clinton Administration to do something about it did the Cuban Five carry out its courageous and dangerous work which the record shows saved lives in Cuba.
 
Today, a panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering the range of egregious violations committed by the prosecution in the original trial. In August 2005 a panel from the same Appeals Court ruled, in a stunning decision with virtually no precedent, to overturn the original trial verdict on the grounds that there could not be a fair and impartial hearing in the hostile climate of Miami, Florida. This ruling was subsequently reversed by the full court under heavy pressure from the Bush Administration's Justice Department.
 
Around the world, and increasingly inside the United States, the case of the Cuban Five, stands as one of the most brutal and outrageous injustices in modern history. As the facts have emerged and the truth about the Cuban Five becomes more known and publicized, Committees to support the Cuban Five have spread all over the world. Their incarceration continues under brutal conditions that have included solitary confinement and denial of family visitations and other violations of formal US laws. 
 
 Washington is paying an increasing political price as this ongoing travesty of justice enters its second decade. On May 2005, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations issued a stinging exposure of the arbitrary and iniquitous nature of the trial and conviction.

On January 2006 Amnesty International condemned the Bush Administration and US authorities for the treatment of the Cuban Five, specifically for the denials of family visitation rights for some of the Cuban Five prisoners. 
 
 An international call for world protests in solidarity with the Cuban Five in September and October 2008 has been issued. Now is the time for all supporters of the Cuban Five and all supporters of civil liberties and justice to step up our work on their behalf. Now is the time to reach out to broad layers of the US population, whatever their political views in general and on the Cuban Revolution in particular.

Pre register: http://www.freethecuban5conference.com/id2.html An Appeal to organize a "WORKING CONFERENCE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE CUBAN 5!"September 12, 2008 marks the 10th year of the arrest of five Cuban citizens ?Fernando Gonzales, Rene Gonzalez, Antonio Guerrero, Ramon Labanino, Gerardo Hernandez î °ho were portrayed as "spies" and "murderers" in the service of "Castro's Cuba." They were tried and convicted in an atmosphere of hype and hysteria in Miami, Florida. The verdict was goaded by ultra-right politicians and a highly orchestrated media campaign of disinformation with the tone of a lynch mob. At the trial there was not a single page of classified information produced showing evidence of espionage or any action directed against the US government. The frame-up charges were packaged as a necessarily vague "conspiracy" to, as the prosecutor actually put it to the jury, "destroy the United States of America." In the period of 17 months between arrest and trial, the five Cubans were subjected to brutal conditions of solitary confinement and near-total isolation to hinder the preparation of their defense. This psychological torture was aimed at breaking their will, in blatant violation of their rights under US law. The hope was to break their spirit and force "confessions" to the trumped-up "conspiracy" charges. But this failed and the trial was finally held in November 2000. They were convicted in June 2001.The truth is that the Cuban Five infiltrated ultra-right Cuban-American organizations, with a clear history of terrorist attacks organized on US soil against the sovereign Cuban state in violation of US law. Over 3,500 Cuban citizens have died in such attacks since the Cuban Revolution triumphed against the Batista dictatorship in 1959. Many tens of billions of dollars worth of damage have been done to the Cuban economy. These attacks stepped up in the mid-1990s as the Cuban economy reeled from an economic depression. Tourist hotels were bombed resulting in death and destruction. Low flying planes ?originating from US territory in violation of US law ?repeatedly violated Cuban airspace. Only after the Cuban government presented clear evidence of such terrorist and criminal activities and repeatedly implored, to no avail, the Clinton Administration to do something about it did the Cuban Five carry out its courageous and dangerous work which the record shows saved lives in Cuba.Today, a panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering the range of egregious violations committed by the prosecution in the original trial. In August 2005 a panel from the same Appeals Court ruled, in a stunning decision with virtually no precedent, to overturn the original trial verdict on the grounds that there could not be a fair and impartial hearing in the hostile climate of Miami, Florida. This ruling was subsequently reversed by the full court under heavy pressure from the Bush Administration's Justice Department.Around the world, and increasingly inside the United States, the case of the Cuban Five, stands as one of the most brutal and outrageous injustices in modern history. As the facts have emerged and the truth about the Cuban Five becomes more known and publicized, Committees to support the Cuban Five have spread all over the world. Their incarceration continues under brutal conditions that have included solitary confinement and denial of family visitations and other violations of formal US laws. Washington is paying an increasing political price as this ongoing travesty of justice enters its second decade. On May 2005, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations issued a stinging exposure of the arbitrary and iniquitous nature of the trial and conviction. The UN body emphasized that the Cuban Five were held in solitary confinement for 17 months, weakening their ability to mount an adequate defense; that most of the evidence against them was withheld from their attorneys, undermining an equal balance between the prosecution and the defense; and that the trial was held in Miami where it was impossible to select an impartial jury in a case linked with Cuba.On January 2006 Amnesty International condemned the Bush Administration and US authorities for the treatment of the Cuban Five, specifically for the denials of family visitation rights for some of the Cuban Five prisoners. An international call for world protests in solidarity with the Cuban Five in September and October 2008 has been issued. Now is the time for all supporters of the Cuban Five and all supporters of civil liberties and justice to step up our work on their behalf. Now is the time to reach out to broad layers of the US population, whatever their political views in general and on the Cuban Revolution in particular. Supporters of the Cuban Five begin by demanding that US authorities comply with US law and allow family members to visit their loved ones. In this Presidential and Congressional election year we aim to raise the issue of the Cuban Five and to reach out and win support from elected officials. To mark the 10th anniversary of their arrests there will be organized public protests on Saturday, September 13. Out of this activity we aim to build support for a National Conference in October 2008 in New York City to support of the Cuban Five.In this spirit, activists in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are issuing this Appeal to Organize a Working Conference in Solidarity With the Cuban Five on Saturday, June 14, 2008. The Working Conference will be just that, a Working Conference, not a political rally or solely a gathering of already engaged and committed activists. We want this Working Conference to generate activity and concrete campaigns from the grass roots ?from religious communities and organizations; from the trade union movement; from young people, students and the broader academic community; from African-American and Latino communities; from fighters for women's rights; from gay and lesbian rights organizations; from consistent advocates for civil liberties and constitutional rights; from artists and cultural workers. This is our challenge. This is our appeal. Now is the time.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
 
ENDORSE THE FREE THE CUBAN 5 MONTH!
 
To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@... 
 
 
So far this is the Calendar events:

Subject:ENDORSE THE FREE THE CUBAN 5 MONTH<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
In solidarity with the movement to free the cuban 5:


ENDORSE THE FREE THE CUBAN 5 MONTH!

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,

In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!”

September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.

The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.

The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!

If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@...


So far this is the Calendar events:


 *   Sat. September 13-All out to Washington DC! 10th anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5!  Demonstration for the Cuban 5! More information will be published soon!

 *   Friday October 10- 10th Anniversary Jericho March in NYC for all Political Prisoners and Prisoners of War in New York City!! Check the Jericho Website: www.jerichony.org

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
 
 
Initial Endorsers:

The Popular Education Project to free the Cuban 5
EL Frente Socialista-Comite de NYC
International Committee for the Freedom of the Cuban 5
Al-Awda Right to Return
Malcolm X Grassroots Movement 
Brigada Vilma Guillois Espin 
The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign
New York Anarchist Black Cross Federation 
The Philadelphia Cuba Solidarity Coalition
Nicaragua Solidarity Committee Chicago
The Cuba Solidarity Committee in Houston
Puerto Rican Alliance Of Los Angeles
To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@... 
 
 
So far this is the Calendar events:

Sat. September 13-All out to Washington DC! 10th anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5!  Demonstration for the Cuban 5! More information will be published soon!
Tues. Sept. 16th-LETTER WRITING NIGHT IN BROOKLYN with the New York Anarchist Black Cross Federation, details TBA…

Subject:Updated: Free the Cuban 5 Month Calendar<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>

Initial Endorsers:

The Popular Education Project to free the Cuban 5
EL Frente Socialista-Comite de NYC
International Committee for the Freedom of the Cuban 5
Al-Awda Right to Return
The Malcolm X Grassroots Movement 
Brigada Vilma Guillois Espin

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@... 
 
 
So far this is the Calendar events:
Sat. September 13-All out to Washington DC! 10th anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5!  Demonstration for the Cuban 5! More information will be published soon!
 
Tues. Sept. 16th-LETTER WRITING NIGHT IN BROOKLYN with the New York Anarchist Black Cross Federation, details TBA…
 
Sun. Sept. 28th-Poetry/cultural Event at Sista’s Place with the December 12th Movement TBA
 
Fri. October 10- 10th Anniversary Jericho March in NYC for all Political Prisoners and Prisoners of War in New York City!! Check the Jericho Website: www.jerichony.org
 
Sat. Nov. 1st-Cuban 5 event with the Radical Women at Freedom Hall in Harlem

The Malcolm X Grassroots Movement

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@... 
 
 
So far this is the Calendar events:
Sat. September 13-All out to Washington DC! 10th anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5!  Demonstration for the Cuban 5! More information will be published soon!
 
Tues. Sept. 16th-LETTER WRITING NIGHT IN BROOKLYN with the New York Anarchist Black Cross Federation, details TBA…
 
Fri. Sept. 26-El Barrio for the Cuban 5 event at Cemi Underground
 
Sun. Sept. 28th-Poetry/cultural Event at Sista’s Place with the December 12th Movement TBA
 
Fri. Oct 3-Venceremos Brigade Report back from Cuba TBA
 
Wed. Oct. 8-Concert for the Cuban 5 in Durham, NC 119 West St. Durham, NC at 9pm
 
Fri. October 10- 10th Anniversary Jericho March in NYC for all Political Prisoners and Prisoners of War in New York City!! Check the Jericho Website: www.jerichony.org
 
Sat. Nov. 1st-Cuban 5 event with the Radical Women at Freedom Hall in Harlem

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@... 
 
 
So far this is the Calendar events:
 
Sat. September 13-All out to Washington DC! 10th anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5!  Demonstration for the Cuban 5! More information will be published soon!
 
Tues. Sept. 16th-LETTER WRITING NIGHT IN BROOKLYN with the New York Anarchist Black Cross Federation, details TBA…

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is proud to forward out this announcement from the Venceremos Brigade; a project nearly 40 years old, which has dedicated its existence to educating and dispelling the lies the US government spreads about Cuba!
 
JOIN THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY CONTINGENT OF THE VENCEREMOS BRIGADE!!
 
40th Anniversary Venceremos Brigade - Join It! 
Applications for the 40th Anniversary Contingent of the Venceremos Brigade - July 19-August 3, 2009 - are now available.Send your name and address tovbrigade@gmail.com40 Years of Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution!40 Years of Friendship with the Cuban People!40 Years of Defiance of the U.S. Economic Blockade and the Travel Ban!40 Years of Love and Struggle!Much has changed since the Venceremos Brigade was created by the U.S. left in 1969.But our vision and commitment remain the same as we prepare to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution and our own 40th anniversary!What is the Venceremos Brigade?Formed in 1969 to express solidarity with the Cuban Revolution, the Venceremos Brigade is a unique educational project that has sent thousands of people to Cuba. Our goal is to give people from the U.S. an opportunity to learn first hand about Cuba, its people, and its revolution, and to link the Cuban peoples' struggle with our struggles here at home.“I believe with this we are beginning a great movement. I believe that this creates the basis for a tremendous development – which will have a huge impact on the whole world – in which the youth of the United States can help other countries. In the same manner that we will have to go to other countries to help them, with the same selflessness and enthusiasm that others have come here, and as our comrades have gone wherever it is necessary.”- Fidel to the second contingent of the Venceremos Brigade, 1970Who are the Brigadistas?Brigadistas are active in a broad range of movements for social change. We include high school and college students and workers for peace, housing, health care, education, labor and cultural rights. Our contingents are multi-racial, and range in age from 16 to 90. As part of our ongoing work in Cuba and the United States, we are committed to fighting racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of discrimination and to recognizing and respecting the differences among ourselves.What does the Brigade do in Cuba?The purpose of the Brigade trips to Cuba is to enable U.S. activists to have meaningful exchanges with Cubans and to experience the day to day realities of Cuban life. We live and work alongside Cubans for two weeks each year. Our program in Cuba includes:- Agricultural or construction or factory work- Visits to schools, factories, clinics and hospitals- Musical and other cultural programs- Informal visits and discussions with CubansThe Venceremos Brigade has never asked for permission (i.e. a 'license') from the U.S. government to travel to Cuba. Since 2003, we have joined with Pastors for Peace in openly proclaiming our constitutional and human right to travel to Cuba in our Travel Challenges.Join us for this historic contingent.Apply now!Space is limited.Send your name and address to vbrigade@... for your applicationExcerpt from Yuri Kochiyama's autobiography in which she wrote a chapter on her experience with the 19th Contingent of the Venceremos Brigade in 1988:"All in all, our two weeks in Cuba was an extensive learning experience of a post revolutionary building era of rectification and progression that would impact our own community work when we returned to the U.S.We found the Cuban people not just work intensive but life intensive and joyful. The national psyche of Cubans was best manifested when the Brigadistas were invited by Poder Popular to a rousing block party in the town of Santa Cruz, in Jibacoa. The hospitality, generosity, openness, and gaiety of the party were earthy and spirited, and the Latin/Caribbean and Afro Cuban music and dance was plainly endemic to life and culture in Cuba.The Julio Antonio Mella Camp (named after the Cuban martyr) was the home away from home for the 149 North Americans that made up the Brigade. The contingent felt sorrowful in leaving, but grateful for an unforgettable and heartwarming experience. We expressed our sentiments in unison many times, hoping the echoes of our shouting "Cuba! Cuba! Cuba! Venceremos te saluda!" would reverberate until the next brigade arrived.

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@gmail.com

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@...

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@...

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@...

To organizations and Individuals who believe in the Freedom of the Cuban 5,
 
In 2006, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, declared the period of time between September 12-October 8 to be a time to raise awareness around the Cuban 5. Here in NYC The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 extends this time to October 12; in order for it to be a full month of events and to include a commemoration of the assassination of Ernest “Che” Guevara. We refer to this period of time as the “Free the Cuban 5 Month!” 
 
September 12th is the tenth anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5 and the Project wants to create a calendar full of events throughout the city, nationally and internationally!  Motivated by the negative and unjust decision of the 11th Circuit Appeals, the Project feels it is time to double our efforts to educate about the case of the Cuban 5 and to garner more support on their behalf.
 
The Project would like to organize Cuban 5 events in NYC communities that have not had them before.  We want to broaden this movement and build Solidarity for the Cuban 5 in as many communities as possible.  
 
The Project is asking organizations and individuals to organize forums, letter writing nights, film screenings, conversations, or fund-raisers for the Cuban 5.  The Project will help by providing speakers, films, literature and promotion!
 
If you are interested in endorsing the Free the Cuban 5 Month AND ORGANIZING AN EVENT, please email us at freethecuban5@...

<pre>How Viagra works? 
The penis gets erect during sexual stimulation when increased blood flows 
to the penis resulting from relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. 
This is due to the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells 
which in turn leads to the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells.
Try Viagra now!

Subject:Filiberto Ojeda Film Festival November<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
 
The Filiberto Ojeda Rios Film Festival 2008 is an initiative of the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign to showcase films that speak to our experience as a colonized people fighting for independence and self-determination!
 
We have named the film festival after assassinated Machetero leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios because his death raised consciousness throughout the Puerto Rican Diaspora; his murder illustrated the colonial oppression Puerto Rico faces and has radicalized a generation of young activists to continue the fight for independence. 
 
We hope these films will do the same.  Join us on our three consecutive Fridays!  
 
Don’t support the Hollywood machine that feeds you nonsense, sex, violence and cheap humor! Learn about yourself, your people, and your struggle!
 
$5 donation/Best offer at each film!
 
 
Friday November 7th, 2008 @ 7pm @ Hunter College West Building 2nd floor room 217 (E68th St. and Lexington Avenue)
 
¡Palante Siempre Palante!
From Chicago streets to the barrios of New York City and other urban centers, the Young Lords emerged to demand decent living conditions and raised a militant voice for the empowerment of Puerto Ricans and other Latino/as in the United States and for the independence of Puerto Rico. Through on-camera interviews with former members, archival footage, photographs and music, the documentary surveys Puerto Rican history, the Young Lords' political vision and actions, and the organization's legacy. Take the 6 train to E68th St. and Lexington Avenue
 
 
Friday November 14th, 2008 @ 7pm @ John Jay College of 
Criminal Justice 889 10th Ave. Room 3305N (between W58th-W59th St. on 10th Ave.)
 
The Double Life of Ernesto Gomez Gomez
What happens to the parents, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters of those willing to sacrifice everything for their beliefs? This film uniquely blends forms to tell the singular story of a son of Puerto Rican revolutionaries — his mother in prison, his father in exile — sent as a baby to Mexico to be raised in safety and anonymity. As a teenager Ernesto/Guillermo learns of his past and collaborates with filmmakers Catherine Ryan and Gary Weimberg to magically chronicle his turbulent journey of self-discovery, offering a striking account of the costs of fiercely held convictions and the binding force of a son's love. (56 minutes) Take the A,B,C,D, 1, and 2 to 59th St. and Columbus Circle
 
 
Friday November 21st, 2008 @ 7:30pm @ The Brecht Forum 451 West Street (that's the West Side Highway) between Bank &amp; Bethune Streets
 
La Operacion/The Operation
This documentary brings to the foreground the problem of widespread sterilization among Puerto Rican women through the use of personal testimony, newsreels, and government propaganda excerpts. The procedure is so common that more than one-third of all Puerto Rican women of childbearing age have been sterilized. Begun in the 1930's as a means of curbing the surplus population, it continues to be reinforced politically and socially in the Puerto Rican communities. Directions: A, C, E or L to 14th St. &amp; 8th Ave, walk down 8th Ave. to Bethune, turn right, walk west to the river, turn left. 1, 2, 3 or 9 to 14th St.&amp; 7th Ave, get off at south end of station, walk west on 12th Street to 8th Ave, left to Bethune, turn right, walk west to the river, turn left. PATH Train to Christopher Street, north on Greenwich St to Bank Street, left to the river. 
 
 
What is the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign?
The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign has been working for the release of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners for over 10 years.  
 
With the release of 11 of the Political Prisoners in September 1999, we have re-dedicated our efforts to securing the freedom of the remaining Puerto Rican political prisoners.  
 
Through educational events, lobbying and public pressure work and activities it is our goal to secure the freedom of these patriots whose only “crime” has been the love of their home land, Puerto Rico.  
 
We support the release of All U.S. held Political Prisoners, oppose the U.S. colonial control of Puerto Rico, U.S. imperialism throughout the world, and the U.S. military presence in Vieques.

ALL OUT TO CONNECTICUT ON NOVEMBER 6TH!!

Arrested earlier this year, Avelino is incarcerated in a state prison in the city of Hartford; in “maximum security” with 23 hours of isolation in a jail cell and with one hour to get fresh air.

They propose to judge him, as they have his comrades in struggle, far away from his Puerto Rican homeland. The U.S. government must recognize Avelino’s status as a fighter for independence and a political prisoner, as he demanded in its imperial courts!

Avelino needs our support! His hearing is set for November 6th, 2008! We cannot let our brother face the court alone! Take the day off from school or work and come with us!
  
ALL OUT TO CONNECTICUT ON NOVEMBER 6TH!!
Contact ProLibertad to get on the Freedom Vans: 718-601-4751 


Who is Avelino Gonzalez Claudio?

Avelino was born in the town of Vega Baja on October 8, 1942. As a student at the University of Puerto Rico, he became a member and then vice-president of the Pro-Independence University Federation (Federación Universitaria Pro Independencia-FUPI). In the mid-1960’s, he married and moved to New York City, earning his living on Wall Street, and working with the Puerto Rican community, joining and then leading the Vito Marcantonio Mission of the Movemiento Pro-Independencia (MPI) in New York. He and his family of four children returned to Puerto Rico, where he worked in the independence movement, including administering the political journal Pensamiento Crí­tico (Critical Thought).

In August of 1985, Avelino González Claudio was accused of participating in the planning and authorization of an operation to secure $7,117,000 from a Wells Fargo armored truck in Hartford, Connecticut on September 12, 1983, along with other Puerto Ricans and two North Americans. The operation was carried out by a clandestine organization fighting for the independence of Puerto Rico, the PRTP-Macheteros. Avelino was not arrested at the time. When the arrests of 1985 took place, and Avelino was not arrested, he assumed the identity of José Ortega, and, while the FBI pursued him, he lived a quiet life, working as a computer teacher to support his family and contributing constructively to his nation, seeking to improve the services provided by the Department of Education. However, more than 20 years later, he was arrested in Manatí­, Puerto Rico, on February 7, 2008.

Avelino is currently being held in Somers, the state of Connecticut’s supermax prison, far from his family and his nation, where he is locked down 23 hours a day, with no access to family visits or phone calls, in conditions which are calculated not only to interfere with his ability to prepare a defense, but which are tantamount to torture. He is awaiting trial in federal court in Hartford.

Subject:Filberto Ojeda Film Festival<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
The Filiberto Ojeda Rios Film Festival 2008 is an initiative of the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign to showcase films that speak to our experience as a colonized people fighting for independence and self-determination!
 
We have named the film festival after assassinated Machetero leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios because his death raised consciousness throughout the Puerto Rican Diaspora; his murder illustrated the colonial oppression Puerto Rico faces and has radicalized a generation of young activists to continue the fight for independence. 
 
We hope these films will do the same.  Join us on our three consecutive Fridays!  
 
Don’t support the Hollywood machine that feeds you nonsense, sex, violence and cheap humor! Learn about yourself, your people, and your struggle!
 
$5 donation/Best offer at each film!
 
 
Friday November 7th, 2008 @ 7pm @ Hunter College West Building 2nd floor room 217 (E68th St. and Lexington Avenue)
 
¡Palante Siempre Palante!
From Chicago streets to the barrios of New York City and other urban centers, the Young Lords emerged to demand decent living conditions and raised a militant voice for the empowerment of Puerto Ricans and other Latino/as in the United States and for the independence of Puerto Rico. Through on-camera interviews with former members, archival footage, photographs and music, the documentary surveys Puerto Rican history, the Young Lords' political vision and actions, and the organization's legacy. Take the 6 train to E68th St. and Lexington Avenue
 
 
Friday November 14th, 2008 @ 7pm @ John Jay College of 
Criminal Justice 889 10th Ave. Room 3305N (between W58th-W59th St. on 10th Ave.)
 
The Double Life of Ernesto Gomez Gomez
What happens to the parents, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters of those willing to sacrifice everything for their beliefs? This film uniquely blends forms to tell the singular story of a son of Puerto Rican revolutionaries — his mother in prison, his father in exile — sent as a baby to Mexico to be raised in safety and anonymity. As a teenager Ernesto/Guillermo learns of his past and collaborates with filmmakers Catherine Ryan and Gary Weimberg to magically chronicle his turbulent journey of self-discovery, offering a striking account of the costs of fiercely held convictions and the binding force of a son's love. (56 minutes) Take the A,B,C,D, 1, and 2 to 59th St. and Columbus Circle
 
 
Friday November 21st, 2008 @ 7:30pm @ The Brecht Forum 451 West Street (that's the West Side Highway) between Bank &amp; Bethune Streets
 
La Operacion/The Operation
This documentary brings to the foreground the problem of widespread sterilization among Puerto Rican women through the use of personal testimony, newsreels, and government propaganda excerpts. The procedure is so common that more than one-third of all Puerto Rican women of childbearing age have been sterilized. Begun in the 1930's as a means of curbing the surplus population, it continues to be reinforced politically and socially in the Puerto Rican communities. Directions: A, C, E or L to 14th St. &amp; 8th Ave, walk down 8th Ave. to Bethune, turn right, walk west to the river, turn left. 1, 2, 3 or 9 to 14th St.&amp; 7th Ave, get off at south end of station, walk west on 12th Street to 8th Ave, left to Bethune, turn right, walk west to the river, turn left. PATH Train to Christopher Street, north on Greenwich St to Bank Street, left to the river. 
 
 
What is the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign?
The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign has been working for the release of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners for over 10 years.  
 
With the release of 11 of the Political Prisoners in September 1999, we have re-dedicated our efforts to securing the freedom of the remaining Puerto Rican political prisoners.  
 
Through educational events, lobbying and public pressure work and activities it is our goal to secure the freedom of these patriots whose only “crime” has been the love of their home land, Puerto Rico.  
 
We support the release of All U.S. held Political Prisoners, oppose the U.S. colonial control of Puerto Rico, U.S. imperialism throughout the world, and the U.S. military presence in Vieques. 
 
CONTACT US AT  ProLibertad@... or call the ProLibertad Hotline at  718-601-4751. Check out our website for campaign updates:  www.ProLibertadweb.com

Forelegs having given way on the steep incline the concentrated
essence of a man. The personalities thus so conspicuous
but it did not come. The little slipping out that way. My

<pre>Hello, Markus

Have you ever thought that luck can meet you anywhere and anytime? As for
me, I have never believed till I didn't come here, and didn't find your
profile among thousands.  And now I understand that luck met me. Are you
really true and alive, because you look like a dream? You are so handsome,
smart and although I have never met you before (and I am sure that I will
never met no man like you!), but something guesses that you are those whom I
am looking for. You don't know about my long searches of my love and you
shouldn't know. It would be better, if you take a pen or take your notebook
and write me a letter here http://heartsattach.net/heallove who knows, maybe luck will
meet you too.


Waiting for your letter

Natali S.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaignhttp://www.prolibertadweb.comProLibertad@... ALL OUT TO CONNECTICUT ON NOVEMBER 6TH!! Arrested earlier this year, Avelino is incarcerated in a state prison in the city of Hartford; in “maximum security” with 23 hours of isolation in a jail cell and with one hour to get fresh air. They propose to judge him, as they have his comrades in struggle, far away from his Puerto Rican homeland. The U.S. government must recognize Avelino’s status as a fighter for independence and a political prisoner, as he demanded in its imperial courts! Avelino needs our support! His hearing is set for November 6th, 2008! We cannot let our brother face the court alone! Take the day off from school or work and come with us! ALL OUT TO CONNECTICUT ON NOVEMBER 6TH!!Contact ProLibertad to get on the Freedom Vans: 718-601-4751   Who is Avelino Gonzalez Claudio? Avelino was born in the town of Vega Baja on October 8, 1942. As a student at the University of Puerto Rico, he became a member and then vice-president of the Pro-Independence University Federation (Federación Universitaria Pro Independencia-FUPI). In the mid-1960’s, he married and moved to New York City, earning his living on Wall Street, and working with the Puerto Rican community, joining and then leading the Vito Marcantonio Mission of the Movemiento Pro-Independencia (MPI) in New York. He and his family of four children returned to Puerto Rico, where he worked in the independence movement, including administering the political journal Pensamiento Crí­tico (Critical Thought). In August of 1985, Avelino González Claudio was accused of participating in the planning and authorization of an operation to secure $7,117,000 from a Wells Fargo armored truck in Hartford, Connecticut on September 12, 1983, along with other Puerto Ricans and two North Americans. The operation was carried out by a clandestine organization fighting for the independence of Puerto Rico, the PRTP-Macheteros. Avelino was not arrested at the time. When the arrests of 1985 took place, and Avelino was not arrested, he assumed the identity of José Ortega, and, while the FBI pursued him, he lived a quiet life, working as a computer teacher to support his family and contributing constructively to his nation, seeking to improve the services provided by the Department of Education. However, more than 20 years later, he was arrested in Manatí­, Puerto Rico, on February 7, 2008. Avelino is currently being held in Somers, the state of Connecticut’s supermax prison, far from his family and his nation, where he is locked down 23 hours a day, with no access to family visits or phone calls, in conditions which are calculated not only to interfere with his ability to prepare a defense, but which are tantamount to torture. He is awaiting trial in federal court in Hartford.

Subject:Avelino Gonzalez Claudio UPDATE<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
The mobilization to Connecticut for the newest Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Avelino Gonzalez Claudio's  Nov. 6th Court Hearing  is postponed until the court hearing is rescheduled.

Below is an update sent to ProLibertad by Avelino's support Committee in Puerto Rico:



UPDATE ON THE CASE OF PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER
AVELINO GONZALEZ CLAUDIO

THERE CAN BE NO TRIAL DATE AT THIS TIME
The date for the beginning of the trial which is to be presided over by Judge Alfred V. Costell of the Hartford Court had been established as November 6, 2008.  The lead attorney for Avelino has informed us that there is no way that the trial can begin on November 6 because the process of discovery of evidence has barely begun.  All the evidence to be presented by the prosecution, including everything that was ceased during the break-ins in 1985, must be given to Avelino and that has yet to be done by federal prosecutors.

At this time we do not know if on November 6th there will be any type of hearing of Avelino’s case.  During the month of November there will be meetings with Avelino’s lawyers in Harford in order to assess the steps taken and to be taken by the prosecution and the defense.
 
THE JUDGE INTERFERES WITH DEFENSE PREPARATIONS
Judge Alfred V. Costello denied requests for coverage of expenses needed by the defense for preparation of aspects of the case that require travel to Puerto Rico in order to interview witnesses and visits to sites that are linked to the case and the arrest of Avelino.

SOLIDARITY IN THE UNITED STATES
Solidarity in the United States with Avelino has been actively maintained by the sisters and brothers of the ProLibertad Campaign and the Hartford Committee, who maintain extensive and up-to-date communication both in the U.S. and internationally in favor of the freedom of all political prisoners detained in North American jails.
 
UPCOMING ACTIVITIES IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR PRISONERS
Compañera Estrella Lagares informs us about the Vigil to be held this weekend in support of the freedom of our political prisoners that has been organized by the Human Rights Commission:
--Plaza Colón in Old San Juan
--Beginning Friday, October 10 until Sunday October 12, 2008

The Committee of Family and Friends of Avelino González Claudio in Puerto Rico will be participating in this Vigil with banners, informational literature, pictures and an educational palm card about Avelino González who is currently imprisoned in Hartford, Connecticut.

There was a press conference on October 8, 2008, Avelino’s birthday, at 10:30 a.m. at the Puerto Rican Bar Association headquarters in Miramar.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello, Torsten

Where are you, my Love? 
I hope that you are waiting for me and your heart is single like my heart.
Every night, I look at the dark sky and say to God: "Oh, My God, send me my love, help me to rid of this loneliness. Because itï¿½s like a bad habit and I hate it and I will give everything to be happy in love!"
I hope that God has heard me, and this letter will be the last attempt to find my soul mate.
You can write me here http://ThePleasureLife.com/honeywithme/ and you may be sure that you will get my reply, because it was always my dream to get acquainted with such interesting man like you.
I believe that we can build True Love together.

Bye

Uliana M.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
The Filiberto Ojeda Rios Film Festival 2008 is an initiative of the ProLibertad
Freedom Campaign to showcase films that speak to our experience as a colonized people fighting for independence and self-determination!

We have named the film festival after assassinated Machetero leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios because his death raised consciousness throughout the Puerto Rican Diaspora; his murder illustrated the colonial oppression Puerto Rico faces and has radicalized a generation of young activists to continue the fight for independence.

We hope these films will do the same. Join us on our three consecutive Fridays!

Don’t support the Hollywood machine that feeds you nonsense, sex, violence and cheap humor! Learn about yourself, your people, and your struggle!

$5 donation/Best offer at each film!


Friday November 7th, 2008 @ 7pm @ Hunter College Thomas Hunter Hall First Floor Room 105 (E68th St. and Lexington Ave.) NEW LOCATION AT  HUNTER COLLEGE

¡Palante Siempre Palante!
From Chicago streets to the barrios of New York City and other urban centers, the Young Lords emerged to demand decent living conditions and raised a militant voice for the empowerment of Puerto Ricans and other Latino/as in the United States and for the independence of Puerto Rico. Through on-camera interviews with former members, archival footage, photographs and music, the documentary surveys Puerto Rican history, the Young Lords' political vision and actions, and the organization's legacy. Take the 6 train to E68th St. and Lexington Avenue


Friday November 14th, 2008 @ 7pm @ John Jay College of
Criminal Justice 889 10th Ave. Room 3305N (between W58th-W59th St. on 10th Ave.)

The Double Life of Ernesto Gomez Gomez
What happens to the parents, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters of those
willing to sacrifice everything for their beliefs? This film uniquely blends
forms to tell the singular story of a son of Puerto Rican revolutionaries — his mother in prison, his father in exile — sent as a baby to Mexico to be raised in safety and anonymity. As a teenager Ernesto/Guillermo learns of his past and collaborates with filmmakers Catherine Ryan and Gary Weimberg to magically chronicle his turbulent journey of self-discovery, offering a striking account of the costs of fiercely held convictions and the binding force of a son's love. (56 minutes) Take the A,B,C,D, 1, and 2 to 59th St. and Columbus Circle


Friday November 21st, 2008 @ 7:30pm @ The Brecht Forum 451 West Street (that's the West Side Highway) between Bank &amp; Bethune Streets

La Operacion/The Operation
This documentary brings to the foreground the problem of widespread
sterilization among Puerto Rican women through the use of personal testimony, newsreels, and government propaganda excerpts. The procedure is so common that more than one-third of all Puerto Rican women of childbearing age have been sterilized. Begun in the 1930's as a means of curbing the surplus population, it continues to be reinforced politically and socially in the Puerto Rican communities. Directions: A, C, E or L to 14th St. &amp; 8th Ave, walk down 8th Ave. to Bethune, turn right, walk west to the river, turn left. 1, 2, 3 or 9 to 14th St.&amp; 7th Ave, get off at south end of station, walk west on 12th Street to 8th Ave, left to Bethune, turn right, walk west to the river, turn left. PATH Train to Christopher Street, north on Greenwich St to Bank Street, left to the river.


What is the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign?
The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign has been working for the release of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners for over 10 years.

With the release of 11 of the Political Prisoners in September 1999, we have
re-dedicated our efforts to securing the freedom of the remaining Puerto Rican political prisoners.

Through educational events, lobbying and public pressure work and activities it is our goal to secure the freedom of these patriots whose only “crime” has been the love of their home land, Puerto Rico.

We support the release of All U.S. held Political Prisoners, oppose the U.S.
colonial control of Puerto Rico, U.S. imperialism throughout the world, and the U.S. military presence in Vieques.

<pre>
 
The Filiberto Ojeda Rios Film Festival 2008 is an initiative of the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign to showcase films that speak to our experience as a colonized people fighting for independence and self-determination!  We have named the film festival after assassinated Machetero leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios because his death raised consciousness throughout the Puerto Rican Diaspora; his murder illustrated the colonial oppression Puerto Rico faces and has radicalized a generation of young activists to continue the fight for independence.  We hope these films will do the same. Join us on our three consecutive Fridays!  Don’t support the Hollywood machine that feeds you nonsense, sex, violence and cheap humor! Learn about yourself, your people, and your struggle!  $5 donation/Best offer at each film!

This film uniquely blends forms to tell the singular story of a son of Puerto Rican revolutionaries — his mother in prison, his father in exile — sent as a baby to Mexico to be raised in safety and anonymity. As a teenager Ernesto/Guillermo learns of his past and collaborates with filmmakers Catherine Ryan and Gary Weimberg to magically chronicle his turbulent journey of self-discovery, offering a striking account of the costs of fiercely held convictions and the binding force of a son's love.

The procedure is so common that more than one-third of all Puerto Rican women of childbearing age have been sterilized.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Viagra, Levitra and Cialis: How they work
Viagra, Levitra and Cialis prevent the breakdown of nitric oxide, a chemical messenger that promotes relaxation and opening of the blood vessels that supply erectile tissue in the penis. Under the influence of nitric oxide, these vessels expand and stay dilated. Increased blood flow makes erectile tissue swell and compress the veins that carry blood out of the penis, resulting in a full erection.
Buy Viagra, LevitraÂ or Cialis!

Nov. 21st Filiberto Ojeda Rios Film festival
The
Filiberto Ojeda Rios Film Festival 2008 is an initiative of the
ProLibertad Freedom Campaign to showcase films that speak to our
experience as a colonized people fighting for independence and
self-determination!
 
We have
named the film festival after assassinated Machetero leader Filiberto
Ojeda Rios because his death raised consciousness throughout the Puerto
Rican Diaspora; his murder illustrated the colonial oppression Puerto
Rico faces and has radicalized a generation of young activists to
continue the fight for independence.
 
We hope these films will do the same. Join us on our three consecutive Fridays!
 
Don¡¯t
support the Hollywood machine that feeds you nonsense, sex, violence
and cheap humor! Learn about yourself, your people, and your struggle!
 
$5 donation/Best offer at each film!
 
Friday
November 21st, 2008 @ 8pm @ The Brecht Forum 451 West Street (that's
the West Side Highway) between Bank &amp; Bethune Streets
La Operacion/The Operation
This documentary brings to the foreground the problem of widespread
sterilization
among Puerto Rican women through the use of personal testimony,
newsreels, and government propaganda excerpts. The procedure is so
common that more than one-third of all Puerto Rican women of
childbearing age have been sterilized. Begun in the 1930's as a means
of curbing the surplus population, it continues to be reinforced
politically and socially in the Puerto Rican communities. Directions:
A, C, E or L to 14th St. &amp; 8th Ave, walk down 8th Ave. to Bethune,
turn right, walk west to the river, turn left. 1, 2, 3 or 9 to 14th
St.&amp; 7th Ave, get off at south end of station, walk west on 12th
Street to 8th Ave, left to Bethune, turn right, walk west to the river,
turn left. PATH Train to Christopher Street, north on Greenwich St to
Bank Street, left to the river.
 
 
What is the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign?
The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign has been working for the release of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners for over 10 years.
 
With the release of 11 of the Political Prisoners in September 1999, we have
re-dedicated our efforts to securing the freedom of the remaining Puerto Rican political prisoners.
 
Through
educational events, lobbying and public pressure work and activities it
is our goal to secure the freedom of these patriots whose only ¡°crime¡±
has been the love of their home land, Puerto Rico.
 
We
support the release of All U.S. held Political Prisoners, oppose the
U.S.colonial control of Puerto Rico, U.S. imperialism throughout the
world, and the U.S. military presence in Vieques.
