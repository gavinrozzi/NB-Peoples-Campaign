Manifeste AnarchofÈministe 


Anarchafeminist Manifesto 


Translated from French (Bulletin C.R.I.F.A. No 44 mars -avril 1983 p. 12,
and Le Monde Libertaire, no 479 - 1983 p. 9 )

  _____  


All over the world most women have no rights whatsoever to decide upon
important matters which concern their lives. Women suffer from oppressions
of two kinds: 1) the general social oppression of the people, and 2)
secondly sexism - oppression and discrimination because of their sex. 

There are five main forms of oppression: 

- Ideological oppression, brainwash by certain cultural traditions,
religion, advertising and propaganda. Manipulation with concepts and play
upon women's feelings and susceptibilities. Widespread patriarchal and
authoritarian attitudes and capitalistic mentality in all areas. 

- State oppression, hierarchical forms of organization with command lines
downwards from the top in most interpersonal relations, also in the
so-called private life . 

- Economic exploitation and repression, as a consumer and a worker in the
home and in low-salary women's jobs . 

- Violence, under the auspices of the society as well as in the private
sphere - indirectly when there is coercion because of lack of alternatives
and direct physical violence. 

- Lack of organization, tyranny of the structurelessness which pulverizes
responsibility and creates weakness and inactivity. 

These factors work together and contribute simultaneously to sustain each
other in a vicious circle. There is no panacea to break the circle, but it
isn't unbreakable. 

Anarcha-feminism is a matter of consciousness. The consciousness which puts
guardians off work. The principles of a liberating society thus stand
perfectly clear to us. 

Anarcha-feminism means women's independence and freedom on an equal footing
with men. A social organization and a social life where no-one is superior
or inferior to anyone and everybody is coordinate, women as well as men.
This goes for all levels of social life, also the private sphere.

Anarcha-feminism implies that women themselves decide and take care of their
own matters, individually in personal matters, and together with other women
in matters which concern several women. In matters which concern both sexes
essentially and concretely women and men shall decide on an equal footing.

Women must have self-decision over their own bodies, and all matters
concerning contraception and childbirth are to be decided upon by women
themselves.

It must be fought both individually and collectively against male
domination, attitudes of ownership and control over women, against
repressive laws and for women's economic and social autonomy and
independence. 

Crisis centers, day care centers, study and discussion groups, women's
culture activities etc. must be established, and be run under womens's own
direction. 

The traditional patriarchal nuclear family should be replaced by free
associations between men and women based on equal right to decide for both
parts and with respect for the individual person's autonomy and integrity. 

Sex-stereotyping in education, media and at the place of work must be
abolished. Radical sharing of the work by the sexes in ordinary jobs,
domestic life and education is a suitable mean. 

The structure of working life must be radically changed, with more part-time
work and flat organized cooperation at home as well as in society. The
difference between men's work and women's work must be abolished. Nursing
and taking care of the children must concern men just as much as women. 

Female power and female prime ministers will neither lead the majority of
women to their ends nor abolish oppression. Marxist and bourgeoisie
feminists are misleading the fight for women's liberation. For most women it
is not going to be any feminism without anarchism. In other words,
anarcha-feminism does not stand for female power or female prime ministers,
it stands for organization without power and without prime ministers. 

The double oppression of women demands a double fight and double organizing:
on the one hand in feminist federations, on the other hand in the
organizations of anarchists. The anarcha-feminists form a junction in this
double organizing. 

A serious anarchism must also be feminist otherwise it is a question of
patriarchal half-anarchism and not real anarchism. It is the task of the
anarcha-feminists to secure the feminist feature in anarchism. There will be
no anarchism without feminism. 

An essential point in anarcha-feminism is that the changes must begin today,
not tomorrow or after the revolution. The revolution shall be permanent. We
must start today by seeing through the oppression in the daily life and do
something to break the pattern here and now. 

We must act autonomously, without delegating to any leaders the right to
decide what we wish and what we shall do: we must make decisions all by
ourselves in personal matters, together with other women in pure female
matters, and together with the male fellows in common matters.

***********

The origin of the Anarchafeminist Manifesto. 

8 March, International Women's Day, is a special relevant day to remember
the Anarchafeminist Manifesto. The origin of the Anarchafeminist Manifesto
is in Norway. The Anarchafeminist Manifesto is the summary of the feminist
political program unanimously agreed upon by the third congress of the
Anarchist Federation of Norway 1 - 7 of June 1982. The manifesto was first
published in Norwegian in Folkebladet (IJA) no 1 1983 pp. 4-5. Soon after
the Manifesto was published in CRIFA-Bulletin no 44 mars-avril 1983 in
French (p. 12) and English (p. 13) language. Later on the French version was
used as the basis for a translation to English that was published on the
Internet, see above. The Manifesto is also translated  to other languages. 

Anarchafeminst Greetings from Anna Quist, co-writer of the Anarchafeminst
Manifesto.

Anarka-feministene


http://www.anarchy.no/anfem.png


(anarkistiske feminister, feministiske anarkister, anarko-feminister) 


Anarka-feminismen har sine r¯tter helt tilbake til 1800-tallet, hvor Emma
Goldmans ideer sto sentralt, jevnf¯r: Emma Goldman: KjÊrlighet eller
ekteskap? Anarkistisk lesebok, PAX 1970. 

I Norge var den anarkistiske kvinnegruppen "Samhold" aktiv bÂde f¯r og etter
andre verdenskrig, se artikkelen "Anarko-feministene " Sentralposten nr 3
2005, forfattet av Harald Fagerhus. Se ogsÂ http://www.fagerhus.no/a_Norge/
&lt;http://www.fagerhus.no/a_Norge/&gt; . 

PÂ 1960-tallet begynte ogsÂ unge anarka-feminister i Norge Â gj¯re seg
gjeldende i hvertfall fra 1966.

F¯rst var det snakk om frittstÂende individer, og deltakere i organisasjoner
med anarkistisk vinkling, ikke egne anarka-feministiske
grupper/organisasjoner. 

F¯derasjonen av Anarkistisk Ungdom, FAU, som startet opp i Kristiansund, ca
1966-67, hadde et anarka-feministisk innslag. I 1968 feiret Kultursyndikatet
pÂ ≈s den ganske anarkistiske oppstanden i Paris, med anarkismens svarte
flagg pÂ taket. Her var anarka-feminister med. Den anarkistiske delen av
Kultursyndikatet var med Â starte Anarkist-F¯derasjonen i Norge (AFIN)  -
Anarkistenes Organisasjon (ANORG) i 1977.  Mange anarka-feminister var med i
AFIN-ANORG helt fra starten. 

Folkebladet - Anarkistorganet, som ble startet opp i 1971 og fremdeles
kommer ut, hadde og har et anarka-feministisk innslag. 

Spesifikke anarka-feministiske framst¯t i Norge er kjent fra midten av
1970-Ârene. 

I 1976 ble an anarkistisk kvinnegruppe startet i Oslo, men den var kortlevd
jevnf¯r Fagerhus' bok om anarkismen og syndikalismen i Norge ca 1850 - 2000,
Anorg forlag, 2005 (ISBN 82-90468-25-3). Det ble ikke ordentlig fart pÂ den
spesifikt anarka-feministiske organiseringen f¯r AFIN-ANORG kom i gang. 

Den anarka-feministiske organisasjonen " Kj¯nnslig gruppe", KG, i AFIN-ANORG
startet i 1977. KG hadde bl.a. fri kjÊrlighet og erotisk kunst pÂ
programmet, og tok avstand fra patriarkalsk og kvinneundertrykkende porno.
KG skiftet litt senere navn til "Anarkofeminstene". Man var aktiv bl.a. med
en l¯peseddel, studier og i AFIN-ANORGs medlemsblad og noe senere med stoff
presentert i Folkebladet. Denne aktiviteten fortsetter fremdeles. 

I 1978 og 79 satte teatergruppen Graxelaget, med bandet FABS, opp
Anarko-p¯nk-operaen "Balladen om Exterazy Grax". Flere anarka-feminister
deltok, og operaen hadde ogsÂ en klart anarka-feministisk vri, bl.a. med
satire over tradisjonelle kj¯nnsroller og patriarkalske tendenser. Operaen
ble utgitt pÂ vinyl pÂ Folkebladets Anarki-label i august 1979, og dette var
Norges f¯rste p¯nke-plate med landsomfattende distribusjon. 

PÂ norsk initiativ ble Den Anarka-Feministiske Internasjonale IAF-AFI
dannet i 1982 pÂ en internasjonal kongress, og den lever i beste velgÂende
fremdeles, se http://www.anarchy.no/iaf.html .  Et viktig dokument for denne
er det Anarka-Feministiske Manifest, et sammendrag av det
anarka-feministiske programmet laget av norske anarka-feminister i 1982, se
http://www.anarchy.no/maf.html  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/maf.html&gt;  .

Nobel Peace Prize 2015 - Anarchist action and news about the Anarchy of
Norway

http://www.anarchy.no/red_bl.jpg
http://www.anarchy.no/anarchistlight.jpg

09.12.2015. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace
Prize for 2015 is to be awarded to Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet. The
Anarchist International congratulates the winners. The prize itself will be
awarded in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of industrialist Alfred
Nobel's death. 

The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Tunisia's National Dialogue
Quartet for helping the country's transition to democracy. The Nobel
committee said the group of civil society organisations had made a "decisive
contribution" to democracy after the 2011 revolution. It said it helped
establish a political process when the country "was on the brink of civil
war". 

The Tunisian quartet is made up of four organisations: the Tunisian General
Labour Union, the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts,
the Tunisian Human Rights League, and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers. It was
created in 2013, two years after the revolution, when security in the
country was threatened following the assassination of two key politicians
and deadly clashes between Islamists and secular parts of society. Nobel
committee chairman Kaci Kullman Five said the group was instrumental in
enabling Tunisia to establish a constitutional system of government
"guaranteeing fundamental rights for the entire population, irrespective of
gender, political conviction or religious belief". The committee, she said,
hoped the prize would "be an inspiration to all those who seek to promote
peace and democracy in the Middle East, North Africa and the rest of the
world". 

The Quartet is credited with creating a national dialogue between the
country's Islamist and secular coalition parties amid deepening political
and economic crisis in 2013. Tunisia's revolution - also known as the
Jasmine Revolution - began in late 2010 and led to the ousting of President
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011, followed by the country's first
free democratic elections last year. Kaci Kullman Five, the chair of the
Nobel peace committee, said the Quartet's role in Tunisia's democratisation
was "directly comparable to the peace conferences mentioned by Alfred Nobel
in his will". Houcine Abassi, head of Tunisia's General Labour Union - one
of the quartet - said it was a "tribute to martyrs of a democratic Tunisia".
"This effort by our youth has allowed the country to turn the page on
dictatorship," he said. The Anarchist International means Tunisia is not a
failed state, but it is fragile and on the brink of a failed state.  

Some time has passed on since the Norwegian People turned their back against
the main economic political course of the social democrat government, at the
1994 EU referendum. The megatrend of the late eighties and early nineties
was a movement to the right and upwards on the Economical Political Map. The
EU referendum indicated a further jump in this direction, and thus the
economic political system in Norway made a revolutionary change, and passed
the border between the marxist social democrat sector and the anarchist
sector of social individualism. This of course is a major social event in
the economic political world history. A long jump further rightwards may
result in a social liberal system, and a reverse tendency may give a
retardation to marxist social democracy, but this is not the case at the
moment. Thus, Norway became an anarchy in 1994/95, and it still is an
anarchist economic-political system. 

The Economic-Political Map 

http://www.anarchy.no/epwm2.gif

The anarchy degree is 100% - the authoritarian degree within the anarchist
quadrant. (Esquerda means left, and direita means right. The star indicates
the Norwegian economic-political system after the velvet anarchist
revolution in 1994/95.)

 

And thus, the Anarchy of Norway is still going strong. Although the system
is significantly anarchist, i.e. within the Quadrant of Anarchism on the
economic political map, it is somewhat far from the anarchist ideal on the
top of the map. "So this is heaven: Norway", the LA-TIMES in USA reports
about Norway, November 2001, but this is however a bit exaggerated; see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/report1.html&gt; American look at Norway - Report no 1,
where the article is quoted, with comments from IIFOR added. Another
American article on the situation in Norway, quoted from NY-TIMES January
2002, also with comments from IIFOR, is also included. 

The main policy of the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; Anarchist
International (AI/IFA) and The Anarchist Federation of Norway (
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/afin.html&gt; AFIN) was presented in the largest
Newspaper in Norway, Verdens Gang 06.11.2001, p 39, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/vg1html.html&gt; Anarchy is [real] democracy - article
in VG. This article also states "Norway [as] a relatively anarchist country,
however a bit far from the anarchist ideal (Norge som et relativt
anarkistisk land, men noksÂ langt fra det anarkistiske ideal)." 

In June 2002 a libertarian direct action against the World Bank's
reactionary policy and the ABCDE-meeting, in Oslo, once more confirmed that
anarchy is significantly on in Norway, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/abcde.html&gt; Direct action against the ABCDE-meeting
and policy. Norwegian firms are more and more horizontally organized,
according to Nordhaug and Gooderham at NHH (Dagsavisen 15 &amp; 16.10.2004). 

A degree of anarchism of ca 54%, as in Norway 2015 is as mentioned not a
high degree of anarchism. This means the authoritarian degree is still ca
46%. If the libertarian degree is less than 50% there is no anarchy at all.
About 54% anarchy degree is quite an accepted estimate. It is a.o.t. quoted
in Dagens NÊringsliv (the Industrial life of today, the main economical
newspaper of Norway) no 2/3 June 2007 and Finansavisen (the Financial
newspaper) Wednesday 17. October 2007, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/dnfa.html&gt; anarchist articles in DN and Finansavisen.


30.05.2007. The Anarchy of Norway was rated as the most peaceful nation in
the world, and since the middle of 1995 the country has also been ranked as
the most libertarian and anarchist on planet Gaia, a.k.a. Tellus and Earth.

15.01.2010. Positive citizen survey: A nationwide citizen survey shows that
86 per cent of Norwegians think that their country is close to being a
perfect country to live in.

02.11.2011. Flat hierarchy challenges new leaders. Norway's "flat, flat,
flat" management hierarchy [i.e. not topheavy pyramid economically and/or
political/adminstrative] poses a huge challenge for new leaders recruited
from overseas. It can also explain why there's so few of them within the
Norwegian business world. "Many leaders can feel so disrespected when they
come to Norway," said Kimberly Lein-Mathisen, global alliance leader for the
large US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Everyone is equal, and employees
are accustomed to being consulted on most matters, and having their say.

So called heaven or not, 54% anarchism is far from the 100% anarchist ideal.
Thus, it is plenty of room for improvement from anarchist perspective, and
by no means time for a break in the fight against authoritarian tendencies.
The revolution must be fought permanent, in the daily life, to sustain and
develop further. However, as long as a) Norway stays out of EU, b) populist
and nationalist tendencies are put at place, and c) the left and right
tendencies outbalance each other reasonable as by now, Norway will probably
stay anarchist, and be a lighthouse for EU and the rest of the world. We
call for anarchist action to sustain and increase the degree of anarchy in
Norway.
