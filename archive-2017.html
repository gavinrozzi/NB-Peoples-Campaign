Manifeste Anarchoféministe 


Anarchafeminist Manifesto 


Translated from French (Bulletin C.R.I.F.A. No 44 mars -avril 1983 p. 12,
and Le Monde Libertaire, no 479 - 1983 p. 9 )

  _____  


All over the world most women have no rights whatsoever to decide upon
important matters which concern their lives. Women suffer from oppressions
of two kinds: 1) the general social oppression of the people, and 2)
secondly sexism - oppression and discrimination because of their sex. 

There are five main forms of oppression: 

- Ideological oppression, brainwash by certain cultural traditions,
religion, advertising and propaganda. Manipulation with concepts and play
upon women's feelings and susceptibilities. Widespread patriarchal and
authoritarian attitudes and capitalistic mentality in all areas. 

- State oppression, hierarchical forms of organization with command lines
downwards from the top in most interpersonal relations, also in the
so-called private life . 

- Economic exploitation and repression, as a consumer and a worker in the
home and in low-salary women's jobs . 

- Violence, under the auspices of the society as well as in the private
sphere - indirectly when there is coercion because of lack of alternatives
and direct physical violence. 

- Lack of organization, tyranny of the structurelessness which pulverizes
responsibility and creates weakness and inactivity. 

These factors work together and contribute simultaneously to sustain each
other in a vicious circle. There is no panacea to break the circle, but it
isn't unbreakable. 

Anarcha-feminism is a matter of consciousness. The consciousness which puts
guardians off work. The principles of a liberating society thus stand
perfectly clear to us. 

Anarcha-feminism means women's independence and freedom on an equal footing
with men. A social organization and a social life where no-one is superior
or inferior to anyone and everybody is coordinate, women as well as men.
This goes for all levels of social life, also the private sphere.

Anarcha-feminism implies that women themselves decide and take care of their
own matters, individually in personal matters, and together with other women
in matters which concern several women. In matters which concern both sexes
essentially and concretely women and men shall decide on an equal footing.

Women must have self-decision over their own bodies, and all matters
concerning contraception and childbirth are to be decided upon by women
themselves.

It must be fought both individually and collectively against male
domination, attitudes of ownership and control over women, against
repressive laws and for women's economic and social autonomy and
independence. 

Crisis centers, day care centers, study and discussion groups, women's
culture activities etc. must be established, and be run under womens's own
direction. 

The traditional patriarchal nuclear family should be replaced by free
associations between men and women based on equal right to decide for both
parts and with respect for the individual person's autonomy and integrity. 

Sex-stereotyping in education, media and at the place of work must be
abolished. Radical sharing of the work by the sexes in ordinary jobs,
domestic life and education is a suitable mean. 

The structure of working life must be radically changed, with more part-time
work and flat organized cooperation at home as well as in society. The
difference between men's work and women's work must be abolished. Nursing
and taking care of the children must concern men just as much as women. 

Female power and female prime ministers will neither lead the majority of
women to their ends nor abolish oppression. Marxist and bourgeoisie
feminists are misleading the fight for women's liberation. For most women it
is not going to be any feminism without anarchism. In other words,
anarcha-feminism does not stand for female power or female prime ministers,
it stands for organization without power and without prime ministers. 

The double oppression of women demands a double fight and double organizing:
on the one hand in feminist federations, on the other hand in the
organizations of anarchists. The anarcha-feminists form a junction in this
double organizing. 

A serious anarchism must also be feminist otherwise it is a question of
patriarchal half-anarchism and not real anarchism. It is the task of the
anarcha-feminists to secure the feminist feature in anarchism. There will be
no anarchism without feminism. 

An essential point in anarcha-feminism is that the changes must begin today,
not tomorrow or after the revolution. The revolution shall be permanent. We
must start today by seeing through the oppression in the daily life and do
something to break the pattern here and now. 

We must act autonomously, without delegating to any leaders the right to
decide what we wish and what we shall do: we must make decisions all by
ourselves in personal matters, together with other women in pure female
matters, and together with the male fellows in common matters.

***********

The origin of the Anarchafeminist Manifesto. 

8 March, International Women's Day, is a special relevant day to remember
the Anarchafeminist Manifesto. The origin of the Anarchafeminist Manifesto
is in Norway. The Anarchafeminist Manifesto is the summary of the feminist
political program unanimously agreed upon by the third congress of the
Anarchist Federation of Norway 1 - 7 of June 1982. The manifesto was first
published in Norwegian in Folkebladet (IJA) no 1 1983 pp. 4-5. Soon after
the Manifesto was published in CRIFA-Bulletin no 44 mars-avril 1983 in
French (p. 12) and English (p. 13) language. Later on the French version was
used as the basis for a translation to English that was published on the
Internet, see above. The Manifesto is also translated  to other languages. 

Anarchafeminst Greetings from Anna Quist, co-writer of the Anarchafeminst
Manifesto.

TERRORIST OCHLARCHISTS - NOT ANARCHISTS - 
IN THE PAST

Post mortem Sergei Nechaev a.ka. Sergey Nechayev, François Claudius
Koenigstein, known as Ravachol, the criminal Bonnot mob, Émile Henry, Leon
Frank Czolgosz and other terrorists falsely posing as 'anarchists' (i.e.
provocateurs), in the past have got the Brown Card, and have thus got their
expulsion from the anarchist movement post mortem. These terrorist
ochlarchists falsely posing as anarchists have really never been a part of
the anarchist movement, but been ochlarchist infiltrators to the movement. 

It is an historical mistake to include these persons in the anarchist
movement, as they were ochlarchist infiltrators - not really anarchists.
They were ordinary criminals, ochlarchist terrorists posing as "anarchists",
and acting according to the authoritarian travesty of 'anarchy', but not
anarchism. This however happened long time ago, in a time with heavy
repression against the anarchist international, with a lot of infiltration
by a) police provokers, who did a lot to discredit the anarchist movement,
and b) a red&amp;brown Leninistoid group called Blanquists, etc. The Blanquists
etc. were RAF (Baader Meinhof, Maoist Marxist-Leninists) type of groups at
that time, and they also managed to use a few naive persons as "useful"
idiots. This is understandable, but not defendable. Terrorism is not a part
of real anarchism. 'Propaganda of the deed' is specific political action
meant to be exemplary to others, and has as such nothing to do with
terrorism.

Both Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin and Malatesta condemned the terrorism.
(Proudhon denounced terrorism, Bakunin denounced Nechaev, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ija431.html&gt; IJA 4 (31), Kropotkin wrote: "a
structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos
of explosives." Malatesta wrote: "He who throws a bomb and kills a
pedestrian, declares that as a victim of society he has rebelled against
society. But could not the poor victim object: 'Am I society?' ", etc. As
far as IAT knows neither Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin nor Malatesta urged
terrorism or participated in terrorism themselves.)

De facto: ochlarchy (mob rule including terrorism) and anarchy &amp;
ochlarchists (including terrorists) and anarchists are opposites as peace
and war. To say de facto ochlarchy is anarchy and ochlarchists (including
terrorists) are anarchists are lies equal to peace is war (remember Big
Brother's Ministry of Truth in Orwell's "1984"). This is proven as a
practically certain truth beyond reasonable doubt in the 3 resolutions in
the Preamble to  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/apt.html&gt; IAT-APT International
Branch. The proof speaks for itself, but more than 50 000 anarchists
confirming the validity of the proof in 2010 add weight behind. 

That terrorists sailing under false anarchist flag wrongly have been labeled
as anarchists historically, mainly in authoritarian Orwellian Big Brother
newspeak lying historical works, shall of course not set precedence for now
and in the future. Faults of the past should never be repeated. And history
books and similar should be corrected so the newspeak lies are removed. And
similar faults of today in the newsmedia broadly defined should of course
also be corrected. To promote such a policy the IAT-APT hands out Brown
Cards to persons and organizations breaking the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; Oslo Convention in this connection. 

NRK-Dagsrevyen 22.05.2004 is wrongly mixing up a terrorist ochlarchist in
Spain in the past with an anarchist, and thus gets a Brown Card. 01.06.2012
Lars Gule in the Breivik case falsely calls Émile Henry 'anarchist' and gets
a Brown Card. 

Frank Aarebrot at NRK 2 28.10.2016 is mixing up a terrorist ochlarchist in
USA (probably Czolgos) with an anarchist, and thus gets a Brown Card.
Wikipedia is also falsely calling Czolgosz an anarchist and gets a Brown
Card.

IAT-APT hands out Brown Cards to Klassekampen (25.02.2017), Øyvind Strømmen
and Nikolai Sitter, for falsely putting blame for terrorism on Bakunin,
based on Sitter's book "Terrorismens historie - Attentat og
terrorbekjempelse fra Bakunin til IS".

Welcome to

May Day 2017 Manifesto 

The fight against the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt; unenlightened
plutarchy and  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; statism including
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; ochlarchy, and for
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; anarchy i.e.
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; real democracy, continues
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; world wide. It is more than ten years since
the financial crisis hit, followed rapidly by a larger economic crisis. The
resulting shock added millions to the already teeming ranks of the jobless
and threw millions more into precarious work. Many workers have lost good
jobs and far too many have also lost the fundamental rights that went with
them. 

There is only one cause of the crisis: lack of proper demand management.
Proper demand management is more easy done in anarchy than archy, look to
Norway, The Swiss Confederation and Iceland, but anarchy is not necessary
for proper demand management. The main player in demand management is the
central administration be it anarchist or archist. The most efficient demand
management is Cogrips-policy, see  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/wec.html&gt; the WEC
resolutions. We call for Cogrips-policy world wide for proper demand
management and the end of the economic crisis.

To say de facto ochlarchy is anarchy and ochlarchists are anarchists are
lies equal to war is peace
And it has similar authoritarian, repressive, functions as Big Brother in
"1984"

Anarchy and anarchism mean "system and management without ruler(s), i.e.
co-operation without repression, tyranny and slavery". 
In short an-arch-y = [(an = without - arch = ruler(s)) - y = system
(included optimal order and law) and management, as, say, in monarch-y]. 
Anarchy and anarchism are efficient and fair system and management without
top heavy societal pyramid, economical and/or 
political/administrative - in income and/or rank, i.e. significant
horizontal organization - real democracy. 
Anarchism is the same as anarchy but also the political tendency that
advocates anarchy and the knowledge about anarchy.
Anarchism is, a. o. t., based on dialog and free, matter of fact, criticism.

In the mostly Orwellian "1984" newspeaking, lying, world, the following lies
are also significant:
In USA, the world's largest economy, economical plutarchy, i.e. capitalism,
is falsely called economic freedom! 
In China, the country with most people in the world, a totalitarian
oligarchy is falsely called the people's democracy! 
And there are much more Orwellian "1984" newspeak type lies in the world -
many of these lies are revealed and unmasked at  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt;
www.anarchy.no!
Be enlightened and prepared for real democracy, i.e. anarchy, feel free to
study all at  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt; www.anarchy.no!

The truth: the only Anarchies, i.e. anarchist countries in the world, are
Norway, The Swiss Confederation and Iceland, 
and they are only anarchies of rather low degree...

And, say, Somalia, as the newspeaking lie-machines CNN, BBC, Foxnews,
Reuters, Associated Press, Wikipedia and most of Internet in general, etc. 
falsely call 'anarchy' is in reality an ochlarchy with rivaling polyarchy,
i.e. chaos and ultra-fascism - not anarchy, and the country most far from
anarchy in the world! 
In general, x-archy, where x can be anything but not 'an', is the opposite
of freedom and real democracy, i.e. anarchy. 

 &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt; www.anarchy.no has practically certain truths and
likely truths, i.e. real scientific non-rejected hypothesis!
Most of so called social sciences and newsmedia represent false ideology,
propaganda, manufactured consent, lies and more lies! 

  _____  

Thousands of anarchists world wide have contributed to the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt; www.anarchy.no.
The  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt; www.anarchy.no is independent and autonomous,
financed by anarchists and not by capitalist commercials or state-subsidies.

The  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt; www.anarchy.no has for the time being about 15
000 visitors and 50 000 hits per month. 
The  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt; www.anarchy.no has been on Internet since July
1996.

Anarchism and anarchy defined


1. Anarchy and anarchism mean "system and management without ruler(s), i.e.
co-operation without repression, tyranny and slavery". In short an-arch-y =
[(an = without - arch = ruler(s)) - y = system (included optimal order and
law) and management, as, say, in monarch-y]. Anarchy and anarchism are
efficient and fair system and management without top heavy societal pyramid
economical and/or political/administrative - in income and/or rank, i.e.
significant horizontal organization - real democracy. 

2. The Economic-Political Map 

http://www.anarchy.no/epwm2.gif

The anarchy degree is 100% - the authoritarian degree within the anarchist
quadrant. (Esquerda means left, and direita means right. The star indicates
the Norwegian economic-political system after the velvet anarchist
revolution in 1994/95.)

3. Authoritarians notoriously mix up anarchy, anarchist and anarchism with
authoritarian tendencies: Chaos, disorder, mob rule (narrowly defined),
lawlessness, the law of the jungle, criminality, riots, theft, corruption,
drugs, mafia, terrorism, autocratic rule, the right to the strongest,
antisocial tyrannic behavior, etc. i.e. different types of superiors and
subordinates, all in all ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined). 

4. The word anarchy origins from greek. The prefix "an" means "negation of"
as in anaerobe versus aerobe and "arch" means "superior, i.e. in contrast to
subordinates", as in archbishop, archangel, archduke, arch villain, etc. NB!
Any villain, ochlarch/ist, is an arch vis-a-vis the victims. Thus anarchy,
anarchism, anarchist, a.s.o., mean coordination on equal footing, without
superiors and subordinates, i.e. horizontal organization and co-operation
without coercion - practically (significant,  &gt; 50% anarchy degree) or
ideally (towards 100% anarchy degree). This is the opposite of the above
mentioned authoritarian tendencies, i.e. different types of superiors and
subordinates - in general ochlarchy. 

5. Ochlarchy is typical with more than 67% authoritarian degree. Anarchy has
equal to or more than 50% anarchy degree. Anarchy is organization in general
without (significant) arch(s), but not without management. The influence on
the management, economic and political/administrative, in private and public
sector, goes in general more from the bottom - the grassroots - upwards than
from the top downwards. At the middle-point of the map the influence from
the bottom is 50%. At the top of the map, the anarchist ideal, the influence
from the bottom is 100%, or the organization is without top, 100% flat.
Norway, The Swiss Confederation and Iceland are anarchies of low degree
(anarchy degree &gt; 50% but less than 60%). Other countries are more or less
authoritarian (significant, &gt; 50% authoritarian degree).
