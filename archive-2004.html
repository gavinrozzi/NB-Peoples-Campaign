Let Us Welcome Compa�ero Juan Segarra Palmer!
By Jorge Farinacci Garc�a

Compa�ero Juan E. Segarra Palmer (Papo) will be leaving a Federal Prison in
the State of Florida this coming January 23, 2004, after having been
imprisoned for nearly 19 years.  This pro-independence fighter was arrested
during a huge repressive operation which was carried out in Puerto Rico by
U.S. armed agents on August 30, 1985, with the alleged objective of dealing
a crippling blow to the pro-independence organization PRTP-EPB (Macheteros).

All those who struggle in our  homeland for a better future for our people,
for a free, just and democratic future, has a great debt with brothers and
sisters such as Juan Segarra who have dedicated their lives in the struggle
for our cause and have suffered the brunt of the fury of U.S. imperialism.
The government of the United States alleged that Compa�ero Segarra was one
of the main leaders of the revolutionary organization The Macheteros and
alleged further that he led the operation that expropriated the deposits of
the Wells Fargo Company in Hartford, Connecticut.   This operation which was
carried out by the Macheteros resulted in more than 7 million dollars
getting into the hands of the revolutionary movement with the goal of
advancing the anti-colonial and independence cause in Puerto Rico, as was
recognized by the U.S. Department of Justice.  It is important to note that
representatives of the U.S. Justice Department were forced to admit that all
that money was utilized for the purposes just mentioned and that no one
utilized these funds for personal gain.

For all the people of Puerto Rico, for the friends, family members and
comrades in struggle of Papo Segarra and for all those men and women that
today continue to hold high the banners of justice and freedom, it is a
great source of pride to have the privilege of being able to welcome this
Compa�ero who has given his all for our cause.

Upon this Compa�ero�s return to Puerto Rico during the weekend of January
24-25, 2004, pro-independence fighters of all political stripes and
ideological tendencies, including socialists, nationalists, Christians and
others, will be united in the jubilation and joy that is embodied in being
able to welcome to his homeland this hero of our cause.   We do so in the
same manner in which we have welcomed home other heroes and sheroes that
have returned to Puerto Rico from the jails of the empire and whose return
has been a result of our peoples continued and unceasing struggle for the
freedom of each and everyone of them.

During these unitary and well deserved welcoming activities all
pro-independence organizations will participate including, the Socialist
Front and its member organizations such as The Workshop for Political
Formation (TFP), The Socialist Movement of Workers (MST), The Revolutionary
Party of Puerto Rican Workers (PRTP), Communist Refoundation (RC), Union of
Socialist Youth (UJS) and the Revolutionary Youth League (LJR).  In addition
other organizations such as The National Hostosiano Congress-New Puerto
Rican Pro-Independence Movement(Congreso Nacional Hostosiano-Nuevo
Movimiento Independentista Puertorrique�o), The Nationalist Party of Puerto
Rico (Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico), The Puerto Rican Independence
Party (Partido Independentista Puertorrique�o), The Resistance Collective
(El Colectivo de Resistencia) and The Revolutionary Movement of the People
(Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo).  Also participating actively will be
the Committee for Human Rights (Comit� Pro Derechos Humanos) and
organization active in the demands for the freedom of all our political
prisoners.

I would like to highlight and make special mention of the participation of
all the student and youth organizations such as the University Federation
Pro Independence (Federaci�n Universitaria Pro Independencia), The
Revolutionary Youth League (Liga Juvenil Revolucionaria) and the Union of
Socialist Youth (Union de Juventudes Socialistas) who are making special
efforts around these activities and taking on important tasks in the
organization and development of the same.  We are conscious of the fact that
none of these young people have had the opportunity to meet Compa�ero Papo
Segarra personally but have clearly expressed their ardent desire to know a
person that has contributed so much so that today our movement  continues to
be such a vibrant political force in Puerto Rico.

All of these organizations along with Papo�s friends and family have come
together in the �Welcoming Committee for Juan Segarra Palmer�.  We have
assumed the task of making the welcoming event for the Compa�ero one which
is characterized by its vibrancy, by its high level of human warmth and
profound patriotic fervor.  Present in this peoples� welcome in spirit will
be his mother and father who struggled for his freedom but passed away
before actually seeing him free.

The Welcoming Committee will shortly be making public the details of the
welcoming, including the exact time and day of his return and the
participation of religious, labor and trade union sectors who have become a
part of this activity.

Today, we make a call to everyone so that none may miss this opportunity and
privilege to participate in an event of this importance for our struggle.
We call upon everyone to join us at the Airport in Carolina on the day of
the return to his people of Compa�ero Juan E. Segarra Palmer.

7:00 pm
ORGANIZED BY THE WBAI JUSTICE AND UNITY CAMPAIGN

Progressive Media at the Crossroads:
Meet Candidates for WBAI/Pacifica Local Station Board

By the end of January, WBAI and the other four Pacifica Network radio
stations will hold historic elections to form Local Station Boards
(LSBs)--the first-ever democratic process in any US radio or TV network.
More than 70 candidates are running to fill openings for 18 listener and 6
staff representatives. Listener-subscribers are eligible to vote for
listener representatives, staff for staff representatives, and the goal is
to create a structure of accountability that will increase the networks
responsiveness to its community base.

The LSBs are being established as part of the resolution of the deep
conflict that ripped through Pacifica in 2000 and 2001. Out of this fight,
a national mass movement arose to reclaim the network from the corporatist
trend that had taken hold in the '90s. In an attempt to head off such
disputes in the future, these new Local Station Boards will have more
influence than the old Local Advisory Boards, including budget oversight, a
major role in hiring and evaluating managers, and general review of station
policy including assessing--while not micromanaging--community needs for
programming.

Candidates for the WBAI LSB are invited to present their views on how to
move forward. What role should community radio play in educating the public
and giving voice to the various movements to build for social change? How
can inclusion of poor and working class communities of color be insured?
With the station facing the worst financial crisis in its history, how can
WBAI stay afloat in economic hard times without sacrificing its treasured
editorial independence? And, in the face of ever-conglomerating corporate
media, how can we fortify left media in general and WBAI/Pacifica in
particular?

This "Meet the Candidates Night" is being hosted by the Brecht Forum in
solidarity with the WBAI elections process and does not represent
endorsement of any candidates or slates. For further details on the WBAI
elections, go to www.wbai.org.


PLATFORM OF THE WBAI JUSTICE AND UNITY CAMPAIGN
Excerpts from the Pacifica Mission Statement, Articles of Incorporation, 
1946:Purposes of the Pacifica Foundation include:* to encourage and provide 
outlets for the creative skills and energies of the community* to engage in 
any activity that shall contribute to a lasting understanding between 
nations and between the individuals of all nations, races, creeds and 
colors* to promote the study of political and economic problems and of the 
causes of religious, philosophical and racial antagonisms* to obtain access 
to sources of news not commonly brought together in the same medium.

We of the WBAI Justice and Unity Campaign are listeners and staff who 
believe that the urgent mission of WBAI and Pacifica must be to broadcast 
the facts, ideas, art, culture and dialogue that will inspire people to work 
for world peace and an end to worker exploitation, racism, sexism, 
homophobia, anti-disability discrimination, religious bigotry, age-ism, and 
other injustices. We are organizers, workers, professionals, and students 
from the many constituencies reflected in the rich tapestry of the WBAI 
community. We work daily on a wide range of social justice issues and 
movements, both local and global. In recent years, many of us fought 
successfully, along with thousands of others, to take WBAI and Pacifica back 
from the corporatist forces that seized our precious media institution.We 
envision WBAI as a progressive educational and organizing hub for the entire 
tri-state area, including all five boroughs of New York City, New Jersey, 
Long Island, Westchester, Rockland and Connecticut. Particularly at this 
time of aggressive U.S. wars and assaults on civil liberties, there is an 
urgent need for peace and justice groups to build a powerful mass movement. 
We believe that the Local Station Board should influence and support the 
daily work of WBAI to fully reflect these issues in its programming.

We also want to see the harnessing of computer technologies, the Internet 
and video to expand WBAI's global reach and eventually transform the station 
into an international media center in partnership with other progressive 
outlets such as Independent Media Centers.The New York City area is bursting 
with talented thinkers, writers, journalists, laborers, teachers, 
organizers, musicians, poets, filmmakers, playwrights, actors, scientists, 
and healers from diverse communities who want to create a more just and 
peaceful society. We especially want to expand the access WBAI provides 
(including by producing, recording, and reporting) to people from 
historically and newly oppressed and disenfranchised communities--including, 
for example, diverse peoples of color, Indigenous peoples, undocumented 
workers and other immigrants, rank-and-file workers, the unemployed, the 
poor, women, lesbians/gay men/bisexuals/transgendered people, people in 
prison, people with disabilities, youth and older people. One way to grow 
our treasury is to build our listenership and membership by offering quality 
programming produced by and serving a large range of communities, 
neighborhoods and regions. We believe that genuine participatory democracy 
at WBAI and Pacifica requires direct involvement in decision-making by 
members of these communities, which constitute the vast majority of the 
people in the tri-state listening area.To accomplish these goals, we stand 
for the following policies:1. Affirmative Action and Outreach. Effective 
affirmative action programs must be established at every level of Pacifica 
through bylaws amendments and policies covering board and committee 
compositions, staffing, training and programming, to provide for the broad 
inclusion of disenfranchised groups reflecting the signal area's 
demographics.

We support Pacifica-wide training on overcoming racism, sexism, homophobia 
and anti-disability discrimination. One of several pressing priorities is 
redressing the gender imbalance in programming and staffing.The Local 
Station Board should help establish a comprehensive outreach strategy that 
complements WBAI's efforts to build bridges and partnerships with the 
listening area's many progressive institutions and movements. We advocate 
comprehensive radio training courses and on-air placement of graduates to 
bring in new energies and talents, prioritizing people from disenfranchised 
groups, especially youth. We support requiring full access for people with 
disabilities to all station events and meetings.2. Programming. We support 
the development, in consultation with the WBAI staff, of changes in the 
programming decision-making structure that will increase involvement of 
listeners from diverse communities.

We will carry out a thorough listener survey and broad community outreach to 
gather feedback and evaluations of WBAI's existing programming and to assess 
unmet needs. Based on analysis of this data, we will encourage the station 
to remedy gaps in programming for particular populations, issues and 
cultural expressions.3. Democracy, Transparency and Local Decision-making. 
Democracy and transparency must be practiced at every level of the Pacifica 
Foundation. We support full disclosure of information on station and network 
budgets and policies. In addition, we call for fair treatment of paid and 
unpaid staff, network-wide recognition of unions, and respect for collective 
bargaining agreements. We believe that the national office has a legitimate 
role to provide administrative and fundraising support and to help develop 
national programming based on local needs and direction. But we oppose 
interference by that office in the local distinctiveness and decision-making 
of each Pacifica station that is fulfilling the network's mission. And we 
will fight against top-down processes, unjustified closed meetings, and 
small-group decision-making by the Pacifica National Board, which are 
unacceptable violations of the by-laws. We will insist on the right to 
active public participation in local and national board meetings. We support 
a simplified democratic process for amending the bylaws. We call for a 
national Pacifica bylaws convention within 18 months to especially 
re-examine issues of diversity, democracy and accountability.4. Fundraising. 
We believe that a primary part of the Local Station Board's mission is to 
assist WBAI in the hard work of fundraising -- particularly during crises 
such as the present one. We will immediately establish a Fundraising 
Committee to carry out this essential work. We will seek broad community 
input to work with station management and staff on innovative strategies for 
both on-air and off-air funding.

We will protect Pacifica's longstanding tradition of rejecting corporate 
underwriting and keeping our airwaves free of commercial promotion.We are 
committed to an ongoing network-wide dialogue by the entire Pacifica 
community aimed at forging a common vision and a long-term plan of action on 
these and other issues.JOIN THE WBAI JUSTICE &amp; UNITY CAMPAIGNFor more

ORGANIZED BY THE WBAI JUSTICE AND UNITY CAMPAIGN

Progressive Media at the Crossroads:
Meet Candidates for WBAI/Pacifica Local Station Board

By the end of January, WBAI and the other four Pacifica Network radio
stations will hold historic elections to form Local Station Boards
(LSBs)--the first-ever democratic process in any US radio or TV network.
More than 70 candidates are running to fill openings for 18 listener and 6
staff representatives. Listener-subscribers are eligible to vote for
listener representatives, staff for staff representatives, and the goal is
to create a structure of accountability that will increase the networks
responsiveness to its community base.

The LSBs are being established as part of the resolution of the deep
conflict that ripped through Pacifica in 2000 and 2001. Out of this fight,
a national mass movement arose to reclaim the network from the corporatist
trend that had taken hold in the '90s. In an attempt to head off such
disputes in the future, these new Local Station Boards will have more
influence than the old Local Advisory Boards, including budget oversight, a
major role in hiring and evaluating managers, and general review of station
policy including assessing--while not micromanaging--community needs for
programming.

Candidates for the WBAI LSB are invited to present their views on how to
move forward. What role should community radio play in educating the public
and giving voice to the various movements to build for social change? How
can inclusion of poor and working class communities of color be insured?
With the station facing the worst financial crisis in its history, how can
WBAI stay afloat in economic hard times without sacrificing its treasured
editorial independence? And, in the face of ever-conglomerating corporate
media, how can we fortify left media in general and WBAI/Pacifica in
particular?

This "Meet the Candidates Night" is being hosted by the Brecht Forum in
solidarity with the WBAI elections process and does not represent
endorsement of any candidates or slates. For further details on the WBAI
elections, go to www.wbai.org.


PLATFORM OF THE WBAI JUSTICE AND UNITY CAMPAIGN
Excerpts from the Pacifica Mission Statement, Articles of Incorporation, 
1946:Purposes of the Pacifica Foundation include:* to encourage and provide 
outlets for the creative skills and energies of the community* to engage in 
any activity that shall contribute to a lasting understanding between 
nations and between the individuals of all nations, races, creeds and 
colors* to promote the study of political and economic problems and of the 
causes of religious, philosophical and racial antagonisms* to obtain access 
to sources of news not commonly brought together in the same medium.

We of the WBAI Justice and Unity Campaign are listeners and staff who 
believe that the urgent mission of WBAI and Pacifica must be to broadcast 
the facts, ideas, art, culture and dialogue that will inspire people to work 
for world peace and an end to worker exploitation, racism, sexism, 
homophobia, anti-disability discrimination, religious bigotry, age-ism, and 
other injustices. We are organizers, workers, professionals, and students 
from the many constituencies reflected in the rich tapestry of the WBAI 
community. We work daily on a wide range of social justice issues and 
movements, both local and global. In recent years, many of us fought 
successfully, along with thousands of others, to take WBAI and Pacifica back 
from the corporatist forces that seized our precious media institution.We 
envision WBAI as a progressive educational and organizing hub for the entire 
tri-state area, including all five boroughs of New York City, New Jersey, 
Long Island, Westchester, Rockland and Connecticut. Particularly at this 
time of aggressive U.S. wars and assaults on civil liberties, there is an 
urgent need for peace and justice groups to build a powerful mass movement.

Let Us Welcome Compa�ero Juan Segarra Palmer!
By Jorge Farinacci Garc�a

Compa�ero Juan E. Segarra Palmer (Papo) will be leaving a Federal Prison in
the State of Florida this coming January 23, 2004, after having been
imprisoned for nearly 19 years.  This pro-independence fighter was arrested
during a huge repressive operation which was carried out in Puerto Rico by
U.S. armed agents on August 30, 1985, with the alleged objective of dealing
a crippling blow to the pro-independence organization PRTP-EPB (Macheteros).

All those who struggle in our  homeland for a better future for our people,
for a free, just and democratic future, has a great debt with brothers and
sisters such as Juan Segarra who have dedicated their lives in the struggle
for our cause and have suffered the brunt of the fury of U.S. imperialism.
The government of the United States alleged that Compa�ero Segarra was one
of the main leaders of the revolutionary organization The Macheteros and
alleged further that he led the operation that expropriated the deposits of
the Wells Fargo Company in Hartford, Connecticut.   This operation which was
carried out by the Macheteros resulted in more than 7 million dollars
getting into the hands of the revolutionary movement with the goal of
advancing the anti-colonial and independence cause in Puerto Rico, as was
recognized by the U.S. Department of Justice.  It is important to note that
representatives of the U.S. Justice Department were forced to admit that all
that money was utilized for the purposes just mentioned and that no one
utilized these funds for personal gain.

For all the people of Puerto Rico, for the friends, family members and
comrades in struggle of Papo Segarra and for all those men and women that
today continue to hold high the banners of justice and freedom, it is a
great source of pride to have the privilege of being able to welcome this
Compa�ero who has given his all for our cause.

Upon this Compa�ero�s return to Puerto Rico during the weekend of January
24-25, 2004, pro-independence fighters of all political stripes and
ideological tendencies, including socialists, nationalists, Christians and
others, will be united in the jubilation and joy that is embodied in being
able to welcome to his homeland this hero of our cause.   We do so in the
same manner in which we have welcomed home other heroes and sheroes that
have returned to Puerto Rico from the jails of the empire and whose return
has been a result of our peoples continued and unceasing struggle for the
freedom of each and everyone of them.

During these unitary and well deserved welcoming activities all
pro-independence organizations will participate including, the Socialist
Front and its member organizations such as The Workshop for Political
Formation (TFP), The Socialist Movement of Workers (MST), The Revolutionary
Party of Puerto Rican Workers (PRTP), Communist Refoundation (RC), Union of
Socialist Youth (UJS) and the Revolutionary Youth League (LJR).  In addition
other organizations such as The National Hostosiano Congress-New Puerto
Rican Pro-Independence Movement(Congreso Nacional Hostosiano-Nuevo
Movimiento Independentista Puertorrique�o), The Nationalist Party of Puerto
Rico (Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico), The Puerto Rican Independence
Party (Partido Independentista Puertorrique�o), The Resistance Collective
(El Colectivo de Resistencia) and The Revolutionary Movement of the People
(Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo).  Also participating actively will be
the Committee for Human Rights (Comit� Pro Derechos Humanos) and
organization active in the demands for the freedom of all our political
prisoners.

I would like to highlight and make special mention of the participation of
all the student and youth organizations such as the University Federation
Pro Independence (Federaci�n Universitaria Pro Independencia), The
Revolutionary Youth League (Liga Juvenil Revolucionaria) and the Union of
Socialist Youth (Union de Juventudes Socialistas) who are making special
efforts around these activities and taking on important tasks in the
organization and development of the same.  We are conscious of the fact that
none of these young people have had the opportunity to meet Compa�ero Papo
Segarra personally but have clearly expressed their ardent desire to know a
person that has contributed so much so that today our movement  continues to
be such a vibrant political force in Puerto Rico.

All of these organizations along with Papo�s friends and family have come
together in the �Welcoming Committee for Juan Segarra Palmer�.  We have
assumed the task of making the welcoming event for the Compa�ero one which
is characterized by its vibrancy, by its high level of human warmth and
profound patriotic fervor.  Present in this peoples� welcome in spirit will
be his mother and father who struggled for his freedom but passed away
before actually seeing him free.

The Welcoming Committee will shortly be making public the details of the
welcoming, including the exact time and day of his return and the
participation of religious, labor and trade union sectors who have become a
part of this activity.

Today, we make a call to everyone so that none may miss this opportunity and
privilege to participate in an event of this importance for our struggle.
We call upon everyone to join us at the Airport in Carolina on the day of
the return to his people of Compa�ero Juan E. Segarra Palmer.

Last Thursday, Jos� Monta�ez Sanes - nephew of David Santes (R.I.P.), the 
Viequense whose death in 1999 from military bombing, sparked the four year 
campaign of civil disobedience that ended the US Navy presence here - was 
sent to Federal prison at Guaynabo by Judge J. Fust�.  Monta�ez Sanes was 
sentenced to 18 months for his participation in actions last May first when 
some old Navy vehicles were burned and the security kiosk at the entrance to 
the ex base was knocked down.

Lawyer Linda Backiel informed us yesterday that she visited Jos�, together 
with the others jailed for this case at MDC Guaynabo, and that all are in 
good health and spirit.    Jorge Cruz, also sentenced to 18 months, will 
report in February to a federal prison in South Carolina, according to 
family members.

We greatly thank the Rosenberg Foundation that has made committments to 
support the children of the accused and imprisoned for May First.  Lawyer 
Rafael Rodr�guez made great efforts to coordinate this support with the CRDV 
and the families.

These 'compa�eros' need our support and solidarity.  The sentences range 
from four months to five years - in the case of Jose P�rez, from Mayaguez.  
It is crucial that we write them messages of love and support.  Here's the

Special Report from the Vieques Peace and Justice Camp

The Vieques prisoners in the federal jail at Guaynabo began a 200 mile walk 
for decontamination, return of our lands under the theme:  not one more 
child sick in Vieques.

Jos� P�rez Gonz�lez  (#21519-069; 5 years ), Jos� V�lez Acosta (#23883-069; 
33 months), N�stor de Jes�s Guishard (#21716-069; 14 months),   Heriberto 
Hern�ndez Carmona  (#22304-069; 4 months), Jos� Monta�ez Sanes (#26317-069; 
18 months) informed us they will walk in their respective 'yards' 
(Recreation Areas) until they collectively complete a total of 200 miles.  
The prisoners jailed for last May First events in Vieques, determined the 
200 mile goal by calculating the area, land and ocean space that, according 
to them, the US Navy has contaminated with it military exercises during more 
than half a century.

We urge all those in solidarity with Vieques to communicate with our 
prisoners to express support or send economic help directly to their 
accounts (prisoner numbers) or to the May First Vieques Support Committee    
  PO Box 191792     San Juan, Puerto Rico  00919-1792   or directly to the 
bank account:    Banco Popular   #  116-26767-4.

To write the prisoners you must include the complete name, prison number and 
address of the jail: MDC Guaynabo    P.O. Box 2147  SJ, PR  00922-2147.

Jorge Cruz, sentenced to 18 months, will report voluntarily to a federal 
prison in South Carolina later this month.  We are also attentive to the 
situation of prisoners Jos� P�rez and Jos� V�lez who may be tranferred soon 
to federal institutions in the US.


THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES

DECONTAMINATION AND RETURN OF LANDS, NOW!

Hotep,

Greetings, the Sundiata Acoli Freedom Campaign would like to thank
everyone who are sending in letters in support of Sundiata Acolis
parole.  The parole hearing that was to take place earlier this month
did not happen.  The parole hearing was moved to sometime in February
2004. We would like to encourage everyone to continue to send in letters
of support for the release of our dear brotha.

Please include in your letter the standard governing the granting of
parole under the New Jersey's 1979 Parole Act which is "prisoners shall
be released on parole unless it is shown by a preponderance of the
evidence that the inmate will commit a crime if released".  Sundiata
Acoli will be 67 years old on the 14th of this month and held kaptive
for the past 30 years and it is time to bring him home. Those of you
involved in churches, organizations, schools or whatever, have them to
write letter.

Please send copies of your letter to the parole board to the New Jersey
freedom campaign address.  Also, send Sundiata birthday greetings.

Again, we thank everyone for your support.

============================

We received the following post from Ilyasha Shabazz, the daughter of
Malcolm X, concerning young Malcolm Shabazz, the grandson of our revered
ancestor,  el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz.

"My nephew, Malcolm, has been transferred to Malone Correctional
Facility under deplorable conditions, only to further break his young
spirit. It is truly an Almighty miracle that this Spirit has kept him
protected, strong and focused with greater perseverance and
determination. Personally, I don't know if I could've done it? And now
being transferred even further north of what was already a 4.5-hr drive
from NYC, he is now almost an 8 hour drive away (fearful/saddened that
he will not get any visitors now because of the distance), and under 23
1/2 hours 'BOXED' lock down with a 6 ounce meal serving per day. He
spent most of his time in the Law Library, reading, writing,
researching, and all of that along with commissary, and other things we
take for granted, are denied him. His spirits are falling.

"The officers ripped up his address book and took the remaining of his
possessions, further making false claims against him. Just the thought
of it all is disheartening as the conscious and conscientious wonder
what can we do for those continually treated unjustly? Certainly after
all we have experienced throughout the world, the great contributuions
and many sacrifices, we as a people are not self-consuming, idle
consumers of shiny, temporary material gain?. . .  "

There is no doubt that young Malcolm is receiving extra harsh punishment
because of his heritage. We view him as a poitical prisoner, recognize
that he is a part of his grandfather's legacy and that it is our
responsibility to cherish and protect him. We know the beast makes every
effort to destroy the message of Malcolm X. We will not let him do that.

Young Malcolm's lawyer, Ron Kuby, is filing an appeal  "seeking to
reverse the sentence (punishment for an alleged infraction of prison
regulations) and reverse the removal of his privileges." We ask you to
do several things to assist our brother at this time.
    1) Write to young Malcolm. He needs all the human contact and warmth
he can get at this time. Malcolm Shabazz's ID number is: 02R4617.  The
full address is:
        Malcolm Shabazz  #02R4617
        Upstate Correctional Facility
        P.O. Box 2001
        Malone, NY 12953

    2) Call the prison regularly (at least once a week) inquiring about
Malcolm's health and physical condition. They need to know that we are
watching them and will tolerate no continued abuse. Those of you who are
members of an organization, create a telephone tree within your
organization, assigning each member a day of the week to call the prison
concerning Malcolm.
        These are the numbers we have for the prison:
            (518) 483-6997,                   Spokesman, James B.
Flateau @(518) 457-8182
            Another number (taken from the DAILY CHALLENGE) is:
(518)639-5516.

    3) Write to the Commissioner of the Department of Correctional
Services denouncing this transfer of the young brother to this Special
Housing Unit. To us laymen, Malcolm has effectively been put in the
"box."  Support Ron Kuby's appeal for  a reversal of the punishment.
The address is:
            Glenn S. Goord
            Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services
            1220 Washington Avenue
               Albany, NY 12226

administration of the prison.)

Dear friends:
Thanks you for your message of solidarity and for your support. I
just have had a hernia surgery last January 16th.

I want you to know that I'm almost completely recovered. In this
occasion I want to share with you my drawing of Nelson Mandela, as a
message of our struggle for a better world (on website).

A big fraternal hug, best wishes. Greetings to all sisters and
brothers. Venceremos! Antonio Guerrero R.


Queridos amigos,

El siguiente mensaje es de Antonio Guerrero, quien se est�
recuperando de una operaci�n del pasado 16 de enero. Antonio est�
actualmente en la prisi�n federal en el estado de Missouri, donde hay
un hospital para prisioneros federales. Cuando est� completamente
recuperado, lo trasladar�n de regreso a la prisi�n de Florence,
Colorado.  Pueden escribirle temporalmente  a la siguiente direcci�n:

Queridos amigos:
Puedo decirles que a�n dentro de una prisi�n del imperio nos hemos
sentido parte del ambiente festivo y del j�bilo revolucionario
victorioso de todo el pueblo cubano y sus amigos en la celebraci�n
del 45 aniversario del triunfo de nuestra Revoluci�n.

Mi recuperaci�n (de la operaci�n de hernia) marcha perfectamente,
olvido a veces que estoy operado. Y el cari�o y la solidaridad de
tantos son en gran parte los causantes de ese olvido.

Tenerlos presente da una fuerza incre�ble.
Un abrazo fraternal, Antonio Guerrero

p.s. Comparto con ustedes este dibujo de Nelson Mandela, (en la
p�gina web) s�mbolo de la lucha por las causas justas del mundo.



The Cuban Five Leonard Weinglass interviewed on this scandalous case

by Leonard Weinglass; January 31, 2004

Leonard Weinglass, well-known civil rights lawyer representing Antonio 
Guerrero, one of the five Cuban political prisoners incarcerated in the 
United States, told Bernie Dwyer, Radio Havana Cuba, in a telephone 
interview from his office in New York, Friday 23rd that the defense team are 
feeling very optimistic about the outcome of the oral arguments hearing due 
to be held in Miami on March 10th. But he pointed out that, of course, the 
question remains, as it has from the very beginning in this case, whether or 
not the climate that exists will allow the facts and the law to prevail. 
[Bernie Dwyer (BD)]: We are getting very close to the 10th of March, the 
date set in Miami by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta for the 
oral arguments in the case of the five Cuban men imprisoned in the US. Can 
you up-date us on the work you and the other members of the legal team have 
been doing? [Leonard Weinglas! s (LW)]: All five lawyers on the case are 
working very hard on the preparation of the argument. We have just, within 
the last two days, received notice from the court that our case is one of 
four cases scheduled to be heard on March 10th and, in fact, we are the last 
case to be heard on that day. This is a relatively good indication because, 
as we are the last case, it opens the possibility that we will be heard for 
more than fifteen minutes. There is, of course, no guarantee or assurance 
but the possibility is now there. In addition we will be filing, within two 
or three days, a formal motion to the court asking them to grant us 
additional time because of the length of the trial and the size of the trial 
record. Hopefully we will be given more than three minutes for each lawyer 
or a total of fifteen minutes, but it remains to be seen. [BD]: You will 
have fifteen minutes to put your oral arguments. Does the US government have 
an equal amount of time to pr! esent theirs? [LW]: The government gets equal 
time so the government will have fifteen minutes and we will have fifteen 
minutes. If the court expands our time to one hour or a half hour, it will 
most likely expand the time for the government as well. [BD] From your 
previous court experience, will you get any indication during the hearing or 
immediately afterwards of the judges reaction to the oral arguments? [LW] 
The court will reserve its decision and we will receive a formal written 
decision probably anywhere from two to four months after the argument. 
However, during the argument, you can get some indication of, at least, what 
the court's thinking is, by virtue of the questions they ask. It's not 
always possible from those questions to know precisely which way the court 
will rule; however you will know what the troubling questions are, if any, 
on the court's mind. [BD] Would you mind going over the main points of the 
appeal to refre! sh our memories? [LW] There are many. Firstly, we're going 
to argue that the evidence on count 3 against Gerardo Hern�ndez was 
insufficient as a matter of law to convict him of conspiracy to commit 
murder. Secondly, we will be arguing that the evidence on count 2, which is 
a charge of conspiracy to commit espionage, was insufficient against my 
client, Antonio Guerrero and the other two who were charged with him. 
Thirdly, we will be arguing that the venue should not have been held in 
Miami. This is a very powerful argument because Miami was the worst possible 
jurisdiction to hear this case. Then we will also be arguing that the 
sentences were excessive and illegal under American law. I just have to 
point out that although there was not a single page of classified 
information involved in this case, my client Antonio Guerrero is serving the 
same life sentence as some of the most notorious spies in American history 
who gave hundreds, if not thousands of p! ages of classified information to 
the Soviet Union. So we will be pointing out the excessive nature of the 
sentence. There are then a number of trial issues. The prosecutor committed 
acts of misconduct, that's one issue; secondly, the defense was impeded in 
its ability to make a defense because the government wrongfully withheld 
documents, claiming they were secret, which the defense was entitled to. 
Thirdly, the government violated its own rules when it broke into the 
apartments of Gerardo Hern�ndez and others and secretly down-loaded their 
computers, all in violation of US law. In addition we will be arguing that 
the defense of necessity was wrongfully taken away from the defendants. 
Under US law, someone is entitled, even encouraged, to break the law, if 
breaking the law will reduce the possibility of violence or physical damage. 
In this case, evidence was introduced which very clearly showed that the 
Five were attempting to reduce the violence and the! physical damage done to 
Cuba by the terrorist network in Southern Florida. Therefore they were 
entitled to not register as foreign agents; they were entitled to carry 
documents that hid their identity. These are minor infractions and the law 
allows a minor infraction if you attempting to prevent a major wrong. That 
was precisely the issue in this case; the judge would not permit the defense 
lawyers to argue that to the jury. This was a wrong and we are going to 
argue this very strenuously. So there are a number of issues in this case, 
all of which require a great deal of time and it is almost impossible to 
accomplish any form of justice during these oral arguments if we are not 
given more than three minutes each to argue our case. [BD] One of the 
central points in the appeal is that Miami was the worst possible venue to 
hold the trial of the five Cuban political prisoners. Now the oral arguments 
will be held in Miami on March 10th. Will that prej! udice the case? [LW] We 
hope not. The judges, of course, are from the 11th Circuit which means that 
most of the judges, and we don't know which three we will have, do not come 
from Miami. A few do but hopefully, we will not have Miami judges. We might 
even have a judge outside of the 11th circuit; we don't know yet who our 
judges will be. But, in the ordinary course, criminal cases out of Miami 
that are appealed to the 11th Circuit in Atlanta are heard on appeal in 
Miami. We thought that this case would be an exception because we are 
arguing the prejudice of that jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the 11th circuit 
decided that it would hold the hearing in Miami just the same. I wouldn't 
say that this, in and of itself, prejudices us but I will say that it does 
indicate a lack of sensitivity on the part of the court to our argument 
against the Miami jurisdiction. [BD]: Do you and the other members of the 
legal team share an optimistic outlook regardi! ng the result of the oral 
argument hearing in Miami? [LW]: Frankly, we had a long discussion by 
conference telephone call Thursday. We have all now read all of our papers, 
approximately seven hundred pages of written argument and we have read the 
prosecutors response, approximately one hundred pages and we are all of the 
opinion that on the basis of the written arguments that we have read, our 
case is very, very strong against the government. And there is even some 
feeling that we should almost rely upon the strength of our written 
arguments versus the government's written arguments. So we are feeling very 
optimistic about the state of the facts of the case and the state of the 
law. Of course, the question remains, as it has from the very beginning in 
this case, whether or not the climate that exists will allow the facts and 
the law to prevail. Hopefully it will but we feel very strong about the 
strength of the case. [BD]: Your client, Antonio! Guerrero, was moved from 
his prison in Colorado to another prison in Springfield, Illinois during the 
week that his mother was visiting him. She was not told anything until she 
went to make her final visit before returning to Cuba. Can you comment on 
that? [LW]: Antonio was moved, unfortunately without prior notice while his 
mother was in Colorado visiting him from Cuba. He was taken to Springfield 
which is a medical center for all federal prisoners who require medical 
attention. I believe he is undergoing minor surgery there as well as a 
physical check-up. He will be kept there for a period of time, longer than 
he would like, but they usually keep people there for at least several 
months even though he could probable be safely returned within a matter of 
weeks. So far as I know he is still in Springfield in Illinois. He and I 
have spoken twice by phone. He is O.K. there and he is still held there. The 
only complaint I would have is that when he got to S! pringfield, they again 
put him in the "Hole" (punishment cell) even though he was traveling for 
medical attention and it was while he was in the "Hole" that he was 
consulted by his surgeon for the medical procedure that they intend to do. I 
felt that was a terribly inhumane thing to do to Antonio. But, nonetheless, 
that's what they did with him for his first five days. He is now out of the 
"Hole" and hopefully he is receiving the medical attention he requires. 
[BD]: Was any reason given why he was put in there having arrived at the 
prison for medical attention? [LW]: No, they don't give a reason When I 
questioned Antonio about that, he said that that is their normal procedure, 
which is quite remarkable given the fact that it is a medical center and 
people who are brought there, and he was flown there, are frequently brought 
there for emergency medical treatment; this is hardly the way you would 
expect a medical center to treat people who arrive for me! dical care and 
attention. [BD]: Olga Salanueva and Adriana P�rez, married to Ren� Gonz�lez 
and Gerardo Hern�ndez respectively, have recently been refused visas again 
to travel to the US to visit their husbands in prison. This time the US 
immigration authorities said they cannot apply for visas on humanitarian 
grounds as they constitute a threat to the security of the United States. 
Surely these grounds are exaggerated? [LW]: Of course, there is absolutely 
no credible evidence that either Olga or Adriana or Olga's children are a 
threat to the United States. It is completely inconceivable that they could 
make a credible claim in that direction. Secondly the issue of the rights of 
families to visit federal prisoners was addressed just within the last year 
by the United States Supreme Court and, in a remarkable ruling; the Supreme 
Court held quite unequivocally that if the United States Constitution 
protects any interest, it protects the interest of maint! aining the family. 
And in that case they held that an agency of the government could not break 
up a family by preventing the inmate who is in custody from maintaining a 
relationship with his spouse and his children. I feel that the Constitution 
of the United States overrides all of the other statutes including the 
immigration statutes. So, it as a clear and fundamental violation of the 
United States Constitution to prevent this family, in Olga and Adriana's 
case, from maintaining its unity. Furthermore, when we looked up the 
regulations of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, their regulations require that 
families be allowed to visit, for the simple reason, that the prisons have 
found through experience that when an inmate is visited regularly by his or 
her family, that inmate becomes a better inmate, less of a problem, less 
angry, less hostile and better for the institution. So, its even in the 
interest of the Federal Prison, as written in the regulation,! that inmates 
are not only allowed but encouraged to see their spouses and their children 
because experience has shown it makes them a better prisoner. So the US 
Constitution and prison regulation clearly favor Olga and Adriana being 
allowed to visit. In addition to that, the government of the United States 
has received a letter of protest from Amnesty International indicating that 
international law requires that an inmate be allowed to see his family 
members. This is very clearly a requirement of humane international law. So, 
on both the international and the constitutional level they should be 
allowed to visit as well as under the regulations of the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons. [BD] The US authorities seem to be fairly entrenched in their 
attitude and continue to refuse to give then visas. Is there anything that 
you think can be done about this? [LW] We are living in a very special time. 
We are living in a time when the government is refusing to a! llow people 
who are being held in Guant�namo as so-called 'combatants' the right to see 
lawyers. Even people held in the United States are being denied the right to 
see lawyers. These are the most fundamental rights, and yet we find that 
since 9-11 that these rights are not being granted. So in a certain sense, 
in a very terrible sense, it's not surprising that even the fundamental 
right of the family is being denied in the case of Olga and Adriana, because 
this is the new America. This is the America that legal scholars, Deans of 
Law Schools, even judges, are now crying out against, that we are losing the 
basic rights that all people have had for two hundred years and just in the 
last two years we have been losing them. And so, it is the arrogance of 
standing against international law, and even US constitutional law, by this 
administration, it's unfortunately not surprising, but it is part of the 
pattern and practice that we have been enduring in the! United States 
recently.

Special Report from the Vieques Peace and Justice Camp

The Vieques prisoners in the federal jail at Guaynabo began a 200 mile walk 
for decontamination, return of our lands under the theme:  not one more 
child sick in Vieques.

Jos� P�rez Gonz�lez  (#21519-069; 5 years ), Jos� V�lez Acosta (#23883-069; 
33 months), N�stor de Jes�s Guishard (#21716-069; 14 months),   Heriberto 
Hern�ndez Carmona  (#22304-069; 4 months), Jos� Monta�ez Sanes (#26317-069; 
18 months) informed us they will walk in their respective 'yards' 
(Recreation Areas) until they collectively complete a total of 200 miles.  
The prisoners jailed for last May First events in Vieques, determined the 
200 mile goal by calculating the area, land and ocean space that, according 
to them, the US Navy has contaminated with it military exercises during more 
than half a century.

We urge all those in solidarity with Vieques to communicate with our 
prisoners to express support or send economic help directly to their 
accounts (prisoner numbers) or to the May First Vieques Support Committee    
  PO Box 191792     San Juan, Puerto Rico  00919-1792   or directly to the 
bank account:    Banco Popular   #  116-26767-4.

To write the prisoners you must include the complete name, prison number and 
address of the jail: MDC Guaynabo    P.O. Box 2147  SJ, PR  00922-2147.

Jorge Cruz, sentenced to 18 months, will report voluntarily to a federal 
prison in South Carolina later this month.  We are also attentive to the 
situation of prisoners Jos� P�rez and Jos� V�lez who may be tranferred soon 
to federal institutions in the US.

Hotep,

Greetings, the Sundiata Acoli Freedom Campaign would like to thank
everyone who are sending in letters in support of Sundiata Acolis
parole.  The parole hearing that was to take place earlier this month
did not happen.  The parole hearing was moved to sometime in February
2004. We would like to encourage everyone to continue to send in letters
of support for the release of our dear brotha.

Please include in your letter the standard governing the granting of
parole under the New Jersey's 1979 Parole Act which is "prisoners shall
be released on parole unless it is shown by a preponderance of the
evidence that the inmate will commit a crime if released".  Sundiata
Acoli will be 67 years old on the 14th of this month and held kaptive
for the past 30 years and it is time to bring him home. Those of you
involved in churches, organizations, schools or whatever, have them to
write letter.

Please send copies of your letter to the parole board to the New Jersey
freedom campaign address.  Also, send Sundiata birthday greetings.

Again, we thank everyone for your support.

============================

We received the following post from Ilyasha Shabazz, the daughter of
Malcolm X, concerning young Malcolm Shabazz, the grandson of our revered
ancestor,  el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz.

"My nephew, Malcolm, has been transferred to Malone Correctional
Facility under deplorable conditions, only to further break his young
spirit. It is truly an Almighty miracle that this Spirit has kept him
protected, strong and focused with greater perseverance and
determination. Personally, I don't know if I could've done it? And now
being transferred even further north of what was already a 4.5-hr drive
from NYC, he is now almost an 8 hour drive away (fearful/saddened that
he will not get any visitors now because of the distance), and under 23
1/2 hours 'BOXED' lock down with a 6 ounce meal serving per day. He
spent most of his time in the Law Library, reading, writing,
researching, and all of that along with commissary, and other things we
take for granted, are denied him. His spirits are falling.

"The officers ripped up his address book and took the remaining of his
possessions, further making false claims against him. Just the thought
of it all is disheartening as the conscious and conscientious wonder
what can we do for those continually treated unjustly? Certainly after
all we have experienced throughout the world, the great contributuions
and many sacrifices, we as a people are not self-consuming, idle
consumers of shiny, temporary material gain?. . .  "

There is no doubt that young Malcolm is receiving extra harsh punishment
because of his heritage. We view him as a poitical prisoner, recognize
that he is a part of his grandfather's legacy and that it is our
responsibility to cherish and protect him. We know the beast makes every
effort to destroy the message of Malcolm X. We will not let him do that.

Young Malcolm's lawyer, Ron Kuby, is filing an appeal  "seeking to
reverse the sentence (punishment for an alleged infraction of prison
regulations) and reverse the removal of his privileges." We ask you to
do several things to assist our brother at this time.
    1) Write to young Malcolm. He needs all the human contact and warmth
he can get at this time. Malcolm Shabazz's ID number is: 02R4617.  The
full address is:
        Malcolm Shabazz  #02R4617
        Upstate Correctional Facility
        P.O. Box 2001
        Malone, NY 12953

    2) Call the prison regularly (at least once a week) inquiring about
Malcolm's health and physical condition. They need to know that we are
watching them and will tolerate no continued abuse. Those of you who are
members of an organization, create a telephone tree within your
organization, assigning each member a day of the week to call the prison
concerning Malcolm.
        These are the numbers we have for the prison:
            (518) 483-6997,                   Spokesman, James B.
Flateau @(518) 457-8182
            Another number (taken from the DAILY CHALLENGE) is:
(518)639-5516.

    3) Write to the Commissioner of the Department of Correctional
Services denouncing this transfer of the young brother to this Special
Housing Unit. To us laymen, Malcolm has effectively been put in the
"box."  Support Ron Kuby's appeal for  a reversal of the punishment.
The address is:
            Glenn S. Goord
            Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services

Dear friends:
Thanks you for your message of solidarity and for your support. I
just have had a hernia surgery last January 16th.

I want you to know that I'm almost completely recovered. In this
occasion I want to share with you my drawing of Nelson Mandela, as a
message of our struggle for a better world (on website).

A big fraternal hug, best wishes. Greetings to all sisters and
brothers. Venceremos! Antonio Guerrero R.


Queridos amigos,

El siguiente mensaje es de Antonio Guerrero, quien se est�
recuperando de una operaci�n del pasado 16 de enero. Antonio est�
actualmente en la prisi�n federal en el estado de Missouri, donde hay
un hospital para prisioneros federales. Cuando est� completamente
recuperado, lo trasladar�n de regreso a la prisi�n de Florence,
Colorado.  Pueden escribirle temporalmente  a la siguiente direcci�n:

Queridos amigos:
Puedo decirles que a�n dentro de una prisi�n del imperio nos hemos
sentido parte del ambiente festivo y del j�bilo revolucionario
victorioso de todo el pueblo cubano y sus amigos en la celebraci�n
del 45 aniversario del triunfo de nuestra Revoluci�n.

Mi recuperaci�n (de la operaci�n de hernia) marcha perfectamente,
olvido a veces que estoy operado. Y el cari�o y la solidaridad de
tantos son en gran parte los causantes de ese olvido.

Tenerlos presente da una fuerza incre�ble.
Un abrazo fraternal, Antonio Guerrero

p.s. Comparto con ustedes este dibujo de Nelson Mandela, (en la
p�gina web) s�mbolo de la lucha por las causas justas del mundo.



The Cuban Five Leonard Weinglass interviewed on this scandalous case

by Leonard Weinglass; January 31, 2004

Leonard Weinglass, well-known civil rights lawyer representing Antonio 
Guerrero, one of the five Cuban political prisoners incarcerated in the 
United States, told Bernie Dwyer, Radio Havana Cuba, in a telephone 
interview from his office in New York, Friday 23rd that the defense team are 
feeling very optimistic about the outcome of the oral arguments hearing due 
to be held in Miami on March 10th. But he pointed out that, of course, the 
question remains, as it has from the very beginning in this case, whether or 
not the climate that exists will allow the facts and the law to prevail. 
[Bernie Dwyer (BD)]: We are getting very close to the 10th of March, the 
date set in Miami by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta for the 
oral arguments in the case of the five Cuban men imprisoned in the US. Can 
you up-date us on the work you and the other members of the legal team have 
been doing? [Leonard Weinglas! s (LW)]: All five lawyers on the case are 
working very hard on the preparation of the argument. We have just, within 
the last two days, received notice from the court that our case is one of 
four cases scheduled to be heard on March 10th and, in fact, we are the last 
case to be heard on that day. This is a relatively good indication because, 
as we are the last case, it opens the possibility that we will be heard for 
more than fifteen minutes. There is, of course, no guarantee or assurance 
but the possibility is now there. In addition we will be filing, within two 
or three days, a formal motion to the court asking them to grant us 
additional time because of the length of the trial and the size of the trial 
record. Hopefully we will be given more than three minutes for each lawyer 
or a total of fifteen minutes, but it remains to be seen. [BD]: You will 
have fifteen minutes to put your oral arguments. Does the US government have 
an equal amount of time to pr! esent theirs? [LW]: The government gets equal 
time so the government will have fifteen minutes and we will have fifteen 
minutes. If the court expands our time to one hour or a half hour, it will 
most likely expand the time for the government as well. [BD] From your 
previous court experience, will you get any indication during the hearing or 
immediately afterwards of the judges reaction to the oral arguments? [LW] 
The court will reserve its decision and we will receive a formal written 
decision probably anywhere from two to four months after the argument. 
However, during the argument, you can get some indication of, at least, what 
the court's thinking is, by virtue of the questions they ask. It's not 
always possible from those questions to know precisely which way the court 
will rule; however you will know what the troubling questions are, if any, 
on the court's mind. [BD] Would you mind going over the main points of the 
appeal to refre! sh our memories? [LW] There are many. Firstly, we're going 
to argue that the evidence on count 3 against Gerardo Hern�ndez was 
insufficient as a matter of law to convict him of conspiracy to commit 
murder. Secondly, we will be arguing that the evidence on count 2, which is 
a charge of conspiracy to commit espionage, was insufficient against my 
client, Antonio Guerrero and the other two who were charged with him. 
Thirdly, we will be arguing that the venue should not have been held in 
Miami. This is a very powerful argument because Miami was the worst possible 
jurisdiction to hear this case. Then we will also be arguing that the 
sentences were excessive and illegal under American law. I just have to 
point out that although there was not a single page of classified 
information involved in this case, my client Antonio Guerrero is serving the 
same life sentence as some of the most notorious spies in American history 
who gave hundreds, if not thousands of p! ages of classified information to 
the Soviet Union. So we will be pointing out the excessive nature of the 
sentence. There are then a number of trial issues. The prosecutor committed 
acts of misconduct, that's one issue; secondly, the defense was impeded in 
its ability to make a defense because the government wrongfully withheld 
documents, claiming they were secret, which the defense was entitled to. 
Thirdly, the government violated its own rules when it broke into the 
apartments of Gerardo Hern�ndez and others and secretly down-loaded their 
computers, all in violation of US law. In addition we will be arguing that 
the defense of necessity was wrongfully taken away from the defendants. 
Under US law, someone is entitled, even encouraged, to break the law, if 
breaking the law will reduce the possibility of violence or physical damage. 
In this case, evidence was introduced which very clearly showed that the 
Five were attempting to reduce the violence and the! physical damage done to 
Cuba by the terrorist network in Southern Florida. Therefore they were 
entitled to not register as foreign agents; they were entitled to carry 
documents that hid their identity. These are minor infractions and the law 
allows a minor infraction if you attempting to prevent a major wrong. That 
was precisely the issue in this case; the judge would not permit the defense 
lawyers to argue that to the jury. This was a wrong and we are going to 
argue this very strenuously. So there are a number of issues in this case, 
all of which require a great deal of time and it is almost impossible to 
accomplish any form of justice during these oral arguments if we are not 
given more than three minutes each to argue our case. [BD] One of the 
central points in the appeal is that Miami was the worst possible venue to 
hold the trial of the five Cuban political prisoners. Now the oral arguments 
will be held in Miami on March 10th. Will that prej! udice the case? [LW] We 
hope not. The judges, of course, are from the 11th Circuit which means that 
most of the judges, and we don't know which three we will have, do not come 
from Miami. A few do but hopefully, we will not have Miami judges. We might 
even have a judge outside of the 11th circuit; we don't know yet who our 
judges will be. But, in the ordinary course, criminal cases out of Miami 
that are appealed to the 11th Circuit in Atlanta are heard on appeal in 
Miami. We thought that this case would be an exception because we are 
arguing the prejudice of that jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the 11th circuit 
decided that it would hold the hearing in Miami just the same. I wouldn't 
say that this, in and of itself, prejudices us but I will say that it does 
indicate a lack of sensitivity on the part of the court to our argument 
against the Miami jurisdiction. [BD]: Do you and the other members of the 
legal team share an optimistic outlook regardi! ng the result of the oral 
argument hearing in Miami? [LW]: Frankly, we had a long discussion by 
conference telephone call Thursday. We have all now read all of our papers, 
approximately seven hundred pages of written argument and we have read the 
prosecutors response, approximately one hundred pages and we are all of the 
opinion that on the basis of the written arguments that we have read, our 
case is very, very strong against the government. And there is even some 
feeling that we should almost rely upon the strength of our written 
arguments versus the government's written arguments. So we are feeling very 
optimistic about the state of the facts of the case and the state of the 
law. Of course, the question remains, as it has from the very beginning in 
this case, whether or not the climate that exists will allow the facts and 
the law to prevail. Hopefully it will but we feel very strong about the 
strength of the case. [BD]: Your client, Antonio! Guerrero, was moved from 
his prison in Colorado to another prison in Springfield, Illinois during the 
week that his mother was visiting him. She was not told anything until she 
went to make her final visit before returning to Cuba. Can you comment on 
that? [LW]: Antonio was moved, unfortunately without prior notice while his 
mother was in Colorado visiting him from Cuba. He was taken to Springfield 
which is a medical center for all federal prisoners who require medical 
attention. I believe he is undergoing minor surgery there as well as a 
physical check-up. He will be kept there for a period of time, longer than 
he would like, but they usually keep people there for at least several 
months even though he could probable be safely returned within a matter of 
weeks. So far as I know he is still in Springfield in Illinois. He and I 
have spoken twice by phone. He is O.K. there and he is still held there. The 
only complaint I would have is that when he got to S! pringfield, they again 
put him in the "Hole" (punishment cell) even though he was traveling for 
medical attention and it was while he was in the "Hole" that he was 
consulted by his surgeon for the medical procedure that they intend to do. I 
felt that was a terribly inhumane thing to do to Antonio. But, nonetheless, 
that's what they did with him for his first five days. He is now out of the 
"Hole" and hopefully he is receiving the medical attention he requires. 
[BD]: Was any reason given why he was put in there having arrived at the 
prison for medical attention? [LW]: No, they don't give a reason When I 
questioned Antonio about that, he said that that is their normal procedure, 
which is quite remarkable given the fact that it is a medical center and 
people who are brought there, and he was flown there, are frequently brought 
there for emergency medical treatment; this is hardly the way you would 
expect a medical center to treat people who arrive for me! dical care and 
attention. [BD]: Olga Salanueva and Adriana P�rez, married to Ren� Gonz�lez 
and Gerardo Hern�ndez respectively, have recently been refused visas again 
to travel to the US to visit their husbands in prison. This time the US 
immigration authorities said they cannot apply for visas on humanitarian 
grounds as they constitute a threat to the security of the United States. 
Surely these grounds are exaggerated? [LW]: Of course, there is absolutely 
no credible evidence that either Olga or Adriana or Olga's children are a 
threat to the United States. It is completely inconceivable that they could 
make a credible claim in that direction. Secondly the issue of the rights of 
families to visit federal prisoners was addressed just within the last year 
by the United States Supreme Court and, in a remarkable ruling; the Supreme 
Court held quite unequivocally that if the United States Constitution 
protects any interest, it protects the interest of maint! aining the family. 
And in that case they held that an agency of the government could not break 
up a family by preventing the inmate who is in custody from maintaining a 
relationship with his spouse and his children. I feel that the Constitution 
of the United States overrides all of the other statutes including the 
immigration statutes. So, it as a clear and fundamental violation of the 
United States Constitution to prevent this family, in Olga and Adriana's 
case, from maintaining its unity. Furthermore, when we looked up the 
regulations of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, their regulations require that 
families be allowed to visit, for the simple reason, that the prisons have 
found through experience that when an inmate is visited regularly by his or 
her family, that inmate becomes a better inmate, less of a problem, less 
angry, less hostile and better for the institution. So, its even in the 
interest of the Federal Prison, as written in the regulation,! that inmates 
are not only allowed but encouraged to see their spouses and their children 
because experience has shown it makes them a better prisoner. So the US 
Constitution and prison regulation clearly favor Olga and Adriana being 
allowed to visit. In addition to that, the government of the United States 
has received a letter of protest from Amnesty International indicating that 
international law requires that an inmate be allowed to see his family 
members. This is very clearly a requirement of humane international law. So, 
on both the international and the constitutional level they should be 
allowed to visit as well as under the regulations of the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons. [BD] The US authorities seem to be fairly entrenched in their 
attitude and continue to refuse to give then visas. Is there anything that 
you think can be done about this? [LW] We are living in a very special time. 
We are living in a time when the government is refusing to a! llow people 
who are being held in Guant�namo as so-called 'combatants' the right to see 
lawyers. Even people held in the United States are being denied the right to 
see lawyers. These are the most fundamental rights, and yet we find that 
since 9-11 that these rights are not being granted. So in a certain sense, 
in a very terrible sense, it's not surprising that even the fundamental 
right of the family is being denied in the case of Olga and Adriana, because 
this is the new America. This is the America that legal scholars, Deans of 
Law Schools, even judges, are now crying out against, that we are losing the 
basic rights that all people have had for two hundred years and just in the 
last two years we have been losing them. And so, it is the arrogance of 
standing against international law, and even US constitutional law, by this 
administration, it's unfortunately not surprising, but it is part of the 
pattern and practice that we have been enduring in the! United States 
recently.

12 February, 2004

Warm greetings from the Committee in Support of those Arrested for Vieques 
the First of May.  As you know, we continue to work in support of the twelve 
arrested by federal authorities for the events during the celebration of the 
end of bombing and military presence on Vieques.  Five 'compa�eros' are 
serving jail sentences and another begins this week a sentence in a jail in 
South Carolina.  The sentences run from four months and five years.  They 
are:  Heriberto Hern�ndez Carmona, Jos� P�rez Gonz�lez, Jos� V�lez Acosta, 
Jos� Monta�ez Sanes, N�stor De Jes�s Guishard and  Jorge Hern�ndez Cruz.   
The rest are on probation and home arrest.

This communication is to ask your support for a radio marathon we will carry 
out on 29 February, at the Bar Association of Puerto Rico in Miramar (San 
Juan).  The purpose is to collect the money necessary to pay the fines 
imposted by the Federal court against the twelve accused.  The amounts 
fluctuate between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.  The total comes close to 40,000 
dollars.

The accused, of whom ten are Viequenses, do not have the resources to pay 
this part of the sentences.  Jes�s Delgado and William Mir� are the only 
ones who have so far paid the penalties since it was a court condition 
before sentencing.   The Committee assumed Miro's 1000 dollar fine because 
he could not pay.  Those who are on probation and house arrest must pay as 
part of the sentencing conditions.  While those imprisoned do not pay, their 
debts accumulate interests.

In September of last year we held the first radio marathon in which we 
collected $16,000, thanks to all your generosity.  The money collected has 
allowed us to make monthly contributions to comissary accounts of those in 
jail and to cover needs of the families.  Also, we covered costs of the 
appeal for Jos� P�rez Gonz�lez, the only accused who went to trial.  There 
remains some funds to cover these costs, but not enough to cover the fines.

The radio marathon will be transmitted from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. on Puerto Rico 
Radio Station, 7.40 on the AM dial, but we will meet at the Bar Association 
at mid day.  We ask that you send your individual contributions, collect 
donations from family, neighbors, friends at work and your organizations.  
You can send your contributions to the address above, by check to the 
Committee or bring it on Sunday the 29th.

Several artists will offer their talent from the stage, we will transmit 
solidarity messages from diverse points in Puerto Rico, including Vieques 
and from the US.  There will also be a quiosk with food and refreshments to 
help make the activity enjoyable and to collect more funds.  Phone numbers 
for people to call in their contributions will be announced during the 
transmission and people can donate with VISA or MASTER CARD.

We once again hope to count on your solidarity.

12 February, 2004

Warm greetings from the Committee in Support of those Arrested for Vieques 
the First of May.  As you know, we continue to work in support of the twelve 
arrested by federal authorities for the events during the celebration of the 
end of bombing and military presence on Vieques.  Five 'compa�eros' are 
serving jail sentences and another begins this week a sentence in a jail in 
South Carolina.  The sentences run from four months and five years.  They 
are:  Heriberto Hern�ndez Carmona, Jos� P�rez Gonz�lez, Jos� V�lez Acosta, 
Jos� Monta�ez Sanes, N�stor De Jes�s Guishard and  Jorge Hern�ndez Cruz.   
The rest are on probation and home arrest.

This communication is to ask your support for a radio marathon we will carry 
out on 29 February, at the Bar Association of Puerto Rico in Miramar (San 
Juan).  The purpose is to collect the money necessary to pay the fines 
imposted by the Federal court against the twelve accused.  The amounts 
fluctuate between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.  The total comes close to 40,000 
dollars.

The accused, of whom ten are Viequenses, do not have the resources to pay 
this part of the sentences.  Jes�s Delgado and William Mir� are the only 
ones who have so far paid the penalties since it was a court condition 
before sentencing.   The Committee assumed Miro's 1000 dollar fine because 
he could not pay.  Those who are on probation and house arrest must pay as 
part of the sentencing conditions.  While those imprisoned do not pay, their 
debts accumulate interests.

In September of last year we held the first radio marathon in which we 
collected $16,000, thanks to all your generosity.  The money collected has 
allowed us to make monthly contributions to comissary accounts of those in 
jail and to cover needs of the families.  Also, we covered costs of the 
appeal for Jos� P�rez Gonz�lez, the only accused who went to trial.  There 
remains some funds to cover these costs, but not enough to cover the fines.

The radio marathon will be transmitted from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. on Puerto Rico 
Radio Station, 7.40 on the AM dial, but we will meet at the Bar Association 
at mid day.  We ask that you send your individual contributions, collect 
donations from family, neighbors, friends at work and your organizations.  
You can send your contributions to the address above, by check to the 
Committee or bring it on Sunday the 29th.

Several artists will offer their talent from the stage, we will transmit 
solidarity messages from diverse points in Puerto Rico, including Vieques 
and from the US.  There will also be a quiosk with food and refreshments to 
help make the activity enjoyable and to collect more funds.  Phone numbers 
for people to call in their contributions will be announced during the 
transmission and people can donate with VISA or MASTER CARD.

We once again hope to count on your solidarity.

Subject:Richie Perez Remembered<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is deeply saddened to announce the passing 
our ally, mentor, friend, warrior, teacher and companero de lucha: Richie 
Perez.

Richie Perez was a powerful force for social change and touched the hearts 
and minds of everyone he worked with throughout the decades.  As many know, 
Richie was a leader in the Young Lords, then in The Puerto Rican 
Revolutionary Workers Organization, was a founder of the National Congress 
for Puerto Rican Rights/Justice Committee, a media activist for 
Latino/Puerto Rican positive representation, a committed Revolutionary, and 
a long-time Internationalist.

Richie inspired and motivated people to work for justice on all levels; his 
infectious commitment to justice and social change inspired several 
generations of youth to continue the fight against Police Brutality and 
racist violence, to free Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, to liberate 
Puerto Rico, to create positive spaces for Latin@s in the media and to unite 
into powerful political coalitions of people of color.  Richie believed in 
serving the people and lived his life in the pursuit of revolutionary change 
and the formation of better world for all people.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign believes that this is Richie�s greatest 
legacy: Richie trained, taught and inspired many young leaders.  Richie 
believed in youth governance and creating supportive spaces for young people 
in social justice work.  He taught with compassion and support; he trained 
with insightful political analysis and instilled the importance of critical 
political analysis in all that we do.  He impressed upon us the need to work 
collectively, to plan effectively, and to build with our allies.

Richie�s passing has been felt by many communities and will be mourned for a 
long time.  Richie was a lot more than just a Puerto Rican leader; he was a 
working class leader, a people of color leader, he was an inspiration to all 
people.  He truly embraced all oppressed peoples, as his brothers and 
sisters.  He, much like Che, felt that any injustice committed against any 
person was an injustice to him.  He embodied the most powerful and essential 
qualities of the revolutionary; he was motivated by great love and the need 
to see people be free.

Richie asked us to remember his last request at his vigil, �It is time to up 
the ante�.  We must carry on our work and �up the ante� in all we do. This 
is our call to action, this is how we remember this amazing man, by �uping 
the ante� in our work.  We must finally learn from and act upon Richie�s 
lessons: we have to move away from our sectarianism, we must come together 
and be accountable to our communities, and we must smash the state together. 
  It is time to scream like they did in Lares, Puerto Rico!!

On a personal note, I, Benjamin Ramos, can still remember the first time I 
met Richie Perez, it was March 29th, 1995; a meeting at CSS for Racial 
Justice Day.  I was there researching Racial Justioce Day and the police 
brutality movement for Urban Latino Magazine.  I sat down with this 
incredible man who had returned my calls and invited me to one of the 
planning meetings for Racial Justice Day.  He took out time to sit down with 
this teenage �wanna-be freelance� journalist, who was in way over his head, 
and broke down the issues piece by piece, all the while inspiring me and 
making me hunger for justice.  I stayed on with the Justice Committee, after 
my article was written, because Richie had sparked in me this need to make 
change.  He set me on the path that I now follow with ProLibertad, the 
Vieques Support Campaign, and El Frente Socialista de Puerto Rico.  He 
trained me, taught me, motivated me, and most importantly supported me along 
the way.

I love you Richie, my father, mentor and friend.  We will up the ante, in 
your honor and for the betterment of our people.

FOR RICHIE,
FOR PUERTO RICO,
FOR JUSTICE AND PEACE!!

The public viewing will be:
Monday and Tuesday, March 30th at

_______________________________________________________________________________

The Socialist Front of Puerto Rico vigorously condemns the assassination of 
Palestinian leader Ahmad Yassin that was recently carried out at the orders 
of Israeli State headed by the war criminal Ariel Sharon.  There is no doubt 
that Sharon attempts to escalate the conflict in Palestine with the 
objective of advancing his most beloved project:  to expel the Palestinian 
People from the occupied territories.


No one in the world that aspires to have peace can feel safe while the 
reigns of any government are in the hands of someone like Sharon who 
embodies the slide toward barbarism that is characteristic of the �new world 
order�.  The main guardian of that order is, of course, the U.S. military 
machine that today occupies Iraq and that intervenes directly in scores of 
countries. But this is precisely its weakness: throughout the planet 
imperialism is faced with a new and growing resistance.  It is also for this 
reason the admiration and solidarity grows with the people of Palestine who 
are always on the front lines of the resistance to imperialist and colonial 
brutality.

Similarly, we also condemn the hypocrisy of the U.S. government who on the 
one hand criticizes the assassination of Ahmad Yassin and on the other 
continues arming his assassins and blocking all attempts at the United 
Nations and other international forums to condemn Israel for its crimes.  We 
know that the Palestinian People will recover from this blow and that they 
will continue strengthening their resistance and to serve as an example to 
all the worlds peoples.

Long Live a Free and Sovereign Palestine!

Socialist Front of Puerto Rico

Press Release

Shameful Melonist*Defense by the MINH at the United Nations

During the hearings that took place today by the United Nations Committee on 
Decolonizaton, 26 people testified representing the different political 
sectors in Puerto Rico.  Since 1998, the Socialist Front has participated in 
these hearings.

In our presentation we made reference to matters of great importance to our 
movement including the causes of Vieques, the political prisoners, those who 
are exiled and persecuted, the death penalty, the demilitarization of our 
universities and the denunciation by our organization of the policies of the 
Popular Democratic Party relating to the so-called status assembly of the 
people of Puerto Rico.  Today, the presenter from Pro-Commonwealth, Angel 
Ortiz, read a letter from the president of the Popular Democratic Party 
(PPD), Anibal Acevedo Vila, where he reiterates his position in favor of a 
constituent assembly with the prior approval of the United States for 2005, 
by pointing out that the relationship between this country and ours is not 
one of a colonial character.

These expressions caused dismay among the pro-independence sectors present 
and made appear ridiculous the representatives of the National Hostosiano 
Independence Movement (M.I.N.H. by its Spanish anacronim) who were there to 
defend their agreements with the Popular Democratic Party regarding this 
matter.

Yesterday, June 13th, a meeting of more than three hours took place among 
representatives from Cuba at the United Nations and sectors of the 
independence movement during which attempts were made to reach a common 
language among all those present regarding the Constituent Assembly.  The 
National Hostosiano Independence Movement (M.I.N.H.) blocked any attempt at 
consensus aluding to the limited time and how this could effect the 
resolution.  Faced with the intransigience of this organization in defense 
of the political projects of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), Cuba opted 
not to eliminate or amend the controversial paragraph that makes reference 
to the Assembly which was imposed and only supported by the M.I.N.H.

During todays� hearings the presentations of the Socialist Front, 
Nationalist Party and other sectors of the independence movement in struggle 
drew major applause.  In contrast, the pathetic defense made in their 
presentations by the M.I.N.H. and the Puerto Rico United Nations Committee 
(COPRONU) in favor of the Assembly on Colonial Status, were received with a 
silent dramatic frigidity by those present.

The Socialist Front of Puerto Rico reiterates its denunciation of the 
shameful cabal of the Popular Democratic Party and the M.I.N.H.  We place 
responsibility squarely on this organization who promotes the politics of 
melonism for having ensared the delegation from Cuba and for the prejudicial 
consequences that this will have for the future of our struggle.  Today, for 
the first time, there was no celebration at the moment of the approval of 
the resolution.

* In Puerto Rico, red is the signature color of the colonialist Popular 
Democratic Party (PPD). Green is the signature color of the Puerto Rican 
Independence Party (PIP).  These sectors much like the Water Melon are 
pro-independence on the outside and pro-colonialist on the inside, 
independentistas supporting the colonial party, its political projects, and 
its electoral aspirations.

There has been an urgent development in Mumia's case which could lead to 
execution if we don't take this very seriously and unite to fight this gross 
injustice.  Recently the stay was lifted from Mumia's case which means that 
Mumia's life is in grave danger.  Below is a description of our important 
action on Sunday, July 11th along with a legal update which explains the 
situation.  Please join us on the 11th to continue to build the movement to 
save the life of Mumia Abu-Jamal.

This year the energy that we usually spend on a July 4th demonstration will 
be used on Sunday, July 11th.  That weekend is the national conference of 
the NAACP and we will be meeting at 3pm at the Pennsylvania convention 
center at 1101 Arch St.  to hold banners, pass out leaflets, educate people 
of the grave injustice in Mumia's case and sign folks up to work.  Please 
spread the word and join us to demand freedom for Mumia Abu-Jamal, an end to 
the racist death penalty and freedom for all political prisoners.

July 5, 2004
On June 29, 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit lifted its 
stay in the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal, and ordered briefing.  At issue is 
whether the death judgment should stand.  Also pending is the prosecution�s 
unconstitutional use of racism in jury selection.

Robert R. Bryan, Mumia�s lead attorney, has summed up the impact of the 
latest developments:

Mumia's case is now moving forward.  He is in extremely grave danger.  The 
authorities want to silence his voice and pen.  They thought this could be 
accomplished by convicting this innocent man and placing him on death row.  
However, his voice against injustice and oppression is now stronger then 
ever, and is heard and read throughout the world.  The government knows that 
the only way to top Mumia is to murder him in the name of the law, to 
execute him.

In over three decades of litigating death-penalty cases, I have not seen one 
in which the government wants so badly to kill a client.  We must not rest 
until Mumia is free!

The Court of Appeals briefing order came on the heels of a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision in Beard v. Banks, ___ U.S. ___, 2004 WL 1402567 (June 24, 
2004).  The issue is whether this ruling should apply to the case of Mumia.  
The prosecution is contending that the order for Mumia�s execution must 
remain and be carried out.  However, it is the view of Mr. Bryan that this 
tragically unfair decision in the Banks case should not have an effect on 
Mumia.

Mr. Bryan explained that Beard v. Banks is a complicated case.  The Supreme 
Court ruled on the appeal by Pennsylvania stemming from a Court of Appeals 
decision that invalidated the death sentence of George Banks, who has been 
on death row over 20 years for multiple murder.  Mr. Banks' death sentence 
had been overturned on the grounds that the jury instructions violated a 
Supreme Court ruling which held that jurors did not have to agree 
unanimously on the existence of mitigating circumstances in order to vote 
against death.  The issue in the Banks appeal was whether Mills v. Maryland, 
486 U.S. 367 (1988) could be applied retroactively, as the Court of Appeals 
for the Third Circuit had held.

On June 24 the Supreme Court reversed in a 5-4 decision written by Justice 
Clarence Thomas.  He concluded that the Mills case, which held 
unconstitutional capital sentencing schemes that require juries to disregard 
mitigating factors not found unanimously, did not apply retroactively.  It 
was determined that the Banks conviction became final in 1987, thus the 1988 
Mills decision did not affect his case even though what had occurred was 
unconstitutional.  Hence, Mr. Banks and others similarly situated could not 
benefit from the Mills decision and his death judgment will stand.  It is 
understood that about 30 other Pennsylvania death sentences are at stake for 
similar concerns.

Mr. Bryan pointed out that Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Souter, 
Ginsburg, and Breyer, strongly dissented.  Justice Stevens said that the use 
of such a procedure is unquestionably unconstitutional today, and I believe 
it was equally so in 1987 when respondent�s death sentence became final.  He 
further explained that Mills simply represented a straightforward 
application of our longstanding view that the Eighth and Fourteenth 
Amendments cannot tolerate the infliction of a sentence of death under [a] 
legal syste[m] that permit[s] the unique penalty to be . . . wantonly and . 
. . freakishly imposed.�  Justice Souter said that a death sentence based 
upon a verdict of 11 jurors who would have relied on a given mitigating 
circumstance to spare a defendant�s life, and a single holdout who blocked 
them from doing so, would surely be an egregious failure to express the 
public conscience accurately.  He found that too much importance is given to 
the finality of capital sentences and not enough to their accuracy.

There are other legal developments concerning the legal fight to free Mumia. 
  Robert Bryan is awaiting a ruling on a petition he filed in the trial 
court, the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia, concerning new evidence of 
innocence and prosecutorial fraud.  He will also be attempting to go back 
into the U.S. District Court regarding the statement by the trial judge, who 
said during the trial in reference to Mumia:

�Yeah, and I'm going to help'em fry the n-----.�

PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER, ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON, HAS BEEN DENIED 
RELEASE


Friday August 13, 2004, New York, NY-  Antonio Camacho Negron, a Puerto 
Rican Political Prisoner incarcerated in FCI Allenwood, was denied release 
the morning of Friday August 13.  Camacho Negron�s family arrived at FCI 
Allenwood to receive him and were dismissed with no explanation concerning 
why his release was suspended and were denied visitation.

As of Thursday August 12, Camacho Negron�s visitation and telephone rights 
were suspended.  No reason has been given for these actions.  The 
ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is investigating the matter and will provide an 
update on Sunday August 15 at the reception and mass that has been jointly 
organized by La Iglesia San Romero De Las Americas-UCC, the church of New 
York City El Diario/La Prensa Columnist Reverend Luis Barrios.

Camacho Negron was not included in President Clinton's 1999 clemency offer, 
which 12 of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners accepted.  He has been 
forced onto parole twice in the past five years. Each time he was paroled, 
he publicly stated that he would not recognize any parole conditions, �I 
will not legitimize the United States authority over Puerto Rico or 
myself...Puerto Rico is an illegal colony of the United States.�  Camacho 
Negron was incarcerated for violating parole conditions each time.

Camacho Negron�s upcoming release represented the culmination of his 15 year 
prison sentence and carries no parole conditions.  Yet, Camacho Negron is 
being held hostage by FCI Allenwood, unable to communicate with family or 
legal counsel.  This is a violation of his basic rights as a prisoner.

The August 15 Reception and Mass was organized as a forum for Camacho Negron 
to dialogue with community activists and leaders about the current political 
climate, the upcoming presidential election and the independence movement in 
Puerto Rico.  The Reception and Mass will proceed as planned, but will serve 
as an organizing meeting for a campaign to support Camacho Negron.


The People�s Mass and Reception is open to the media and will take place on:

Sunday August 15, 2004 at 11:30am-3pm
La Iglesia San Romero de Las Americas-UCC
2410 Amsterdam Avenue (Between w179th-180th St.) Fourth floor

PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER, ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON, IS BEING HELD
INDEFINITELY


Sunday August 15, 2004, New York, NY-  Antonio Camacho Negron, a Puerto
Rican Political Prisoner incarcerated in FCI Allenwood, was denied release
the morning of Friday August 13.  According to Linda Backiel Esq., a
progressive lawyer based in Puerto Rico, a hearing to deal with the fine
that was imposed on Camacho Negron during his sentencing was never
scheduled.  Camacho Negron�s release could not occur without the hearing.
Camacho Negron, who has refused to pay the fine, denied the application for
a hearing.  Prison officials are supposed to schedule a hearing regardless
of the prisoner�s refusal to participate, but they did not.

Allegedly a hearing has been called for this upcoming week, but no official
date or time has been established.  As of now, Camacho Negron is being held
indefinitely until this hearing can take place.

Camacho Negron was not included in President Clinton's 1999 clemency offer,
which 12 of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners accepted.  He has been
forced onto parole twice in the past five years. Each time he was paroled,
he publicly stated that he would not recognize any parole conditions, �I

Negron was incarcerated for violating parole conditions each time.

Camacho Negron�s upcoming release represents the culmination of his prison
sentence and carries no parole conditions.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is continuing to investigate this matter
and will keep our supporters, allies and the media updated as information
comes to us.

in El Campamento Pro Vieques, is calling on all forces to write to Perez 
Gonzalez and to let him know that we are in support of him!!  We need to 
show Perez Gonzalez and the prison officials that he has the support of ALL 
PEOPLE who believe in justice, freedom and liberation.

Send him a letter, postcard or card.  A few words of hope and encouragement 
cannot do a lot for our prisoners.

We cannot allow prison officials to continue violating the rights of all 
Prisoners, especially Political Prisoners incarcerated for their political 
beliefs and actions.  These acts of violence and repression on prisoners 
cannot go unpunished or unnoticed.  SEND JOSE PEREZ A LETTER!!

BE ON THE LOOK OUT: Another Action alert will be published this week with 
information on how we will continue the pressure on the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons!!

Re: Federal inmate Jos� P�rez-Gonz�lez #21519-069

Dear Mr. Holt,

I am writing you regarding federal inmate Jos� P�rez-Gonz�lez, #21519-069.
Mr. P�rez-Gonz�lez was transferred to Elmore County Prison in Wetumpka,
Alabama several weeks ago. The reason for his transfer is unknown.  He was
kept in solitary confinement for several weeks, without underclothes or
basic hygienic materials.

I request that you investigate Mr. P�rez-Gonz�lez' status and that he be
transferred to a minimum security facility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

I am aware of that Elmore County Jail is a contract facility for the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons and has been accused of human rights violations.  I
request your immediate attention to Jos� P�rez-Gonz�lez' case.

Sincerely,


Address:

The Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques and groups in 
solidarity with the struggle for peace on Vieques, denounced the cruel and 
inhuman treatment received in US federal prisons by Jos� P�rez Gonz�lez, 
prisoner for the events of May First 2003 in Vieques. The organizations that 
participated in a conference about Vieques held in Washington, DC last May, 
include, among others: United Methodist Church; United Church of Christ, 
American Friends Service Committee (Quakers), Fellowship of Reconciliation, 
Pro Libertad in NY, National Boricua Human Rights Network, Military Toxics 
Project, All Puerto Rico with Vieques Coordinator, Menonite Church, 
Caribbean Project for Justice and Peace.

According to lawyers and family members, Jos� has been in constant movement 
from one jail to another, placed in solitary confinement on several 
occasions and transferred without knowledge of legal representatives.

In telephone conversation with the prisoner's father from Florida, he 
described how 'by the Grace of God' he found out his son had been 
transferred from an Air Force Base facility in Montgomery, Alabama to the 
Elmore County Jail in North Wetumpka, Alabama. Now, he has informed us, his 
son is in the federal prison in Atlanta, Georgia.

Representatives of human rights, environmental, cultural, religious and 
political groups in New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Massachusetts, 
California, Puerto Rico and other places, repudiate the way Federal Bureau 
of Prisons personnel carry out an obvious process of political harassment 
against Jos� P�rez. The Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques, 
organizations in support of the Accused and Prisoners for May First 2003 in 
Puerto Rico and the international groups will begin shortly a campaign of 
letters and calls to government officials and media to guarantee respect for 
the human rights of Jos� P�rez.  Jose Perez Gonzalez has been moved to a 
federal prison in Atlanta, Georgia.  According to Jose, His conditions have 
improved.  He is currently in general population and doing well.

Please write to Jose Perez Gonzalez and Let him know that you are thinking 
of him.

The Committee for the Rescue and Development of
Vieques and groups in solidarity with the struggle for
peace on Vieques, denounced the cruel and inhuman
treatment received in US federal prisons by Jos� P�rez
Gonz�lez, prisoner for the events of May First 2003 in
Vieques. The organizations that participated in a
conference about Vieques held in Washington, DC last
May, include, among others: United Methodist Church;
United Church of Christ, American Friends Service
Committee (Quakers), Fellowship of Reconciliation, Pro
Libertad in NY, National Boricua Human Rights Network,
Military Toxics Project, All Puerto Rico with Vieques
Coordinator, Menonite Church, Caribbean Project for
Justice and Peace.

According to lawyers and family members, Jos� has been
in constant movement from one jail to another, placed
in solitary confinement on several occasions and
transferred without knowledge of legal
representatives.

In telephone conversation with the prisoner's father
from Florida, he described how 'by the Grace of God'
he found out his son had been transferred from an Air
Force Base facility in Montgomery, Alabama to the
Elmore County Jail in North Wetumpka, Alabama. Now, he
has informed us, his son is in the federal prison in
Atlanta, Georgia.

Representatives of human rights, environmental,
cultural, religious and political groups in New York,
New Jersey, Chicago, Massachusetts, California, Puerto
Rico and other places, repudiate the way Federal
Bureau of Prisons personnel carry out an obvious
process of political harassment against Jos� P�rez.
The Committee for the Rescue and Development of
Vieques, organizations in support of the Accused and
Prisoners for May First 2003 in Puerto Rico and the
international groups will begin shortly a campaign of
letters and calls to government officials and media to
guarantee respect for the human rights of Jos� P�rez.
Jose Perez Gonzalez has been moved to a federal prison
in Atlanta, Georgia.  According to Jose, His
conditions have improved.  He is currently in general
population and doing well.

Please write to Jose Perez Gonzalez and Let him know
that you are thinking of him.

This week�s edition is on the hottest cultural/political spot to open up in
El Barrio: Camaradas El Barrio.  C A M A R A D A S el barrio
(http://camaradaselbarrio.com/) is a worker's public house where camaraderie
is built atop of a fine selection of wine, over 40 great beers from around
the world, great music and the best and boldest cuisine in Spanish Harlem.

This uniquely styled space (designed by Daniel Gonzales/ Blue Collar
Worker), reflecting an industrial and rustic feel in its wood and metal
design and decor, celebrates the spirit of factory workers and the fostering
of camaraderie in watering holes. This legacy of our working-class parents
and grandparents has become a bright star in the Spanish Harlem bar,
restaurant and entertainment scene.

PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONERS CARLOS ALBERTO TORRES AND HAYDEE BELTRAN 
HAVE A NEW GRANDDAUGHTER!!

Maya Torres was born on Saturday September 23rd, 2004, the Grito de Lares. 
Her proud grandparents, Puerto Rican Political Prisoners Carlos Alberto 
Torres and Haydee Beltran, can�t be there to welcome her into the world. 
They can�t go to the Miami neonatal intensive care unit to support their 
daughter Clarissa, where her four pounds six ounce, one-month premature baby 
is being treated for pneumonia. They can�t help Clarissa as she recuperates 
from the Cesarian operation. They can�t baby sit Maya�s big sister, four and 
a half year old Alexandra (Munchie). They can�t just pick up the phone and 
call their daughter, even to share long distance this moment of joy in the 
family�s life. They don�t know when they�ll be able to first meet their 
granddaughter they�ll have to wait until both Clarissa and Maya are healthy 
enough to withstand the rigors of travel. While they wait, they can�t get 
emailed digital photos of this new member of their family. And speaking of 
waiting, grandma Haydee won�t be out of prison until 2010; grandpa Carlos, 
2024; both in prison since 1980.

Congratulations can be sent to grandparents

Larry Giddings, an anti authoritarian political prisoner was released on 
parole in August, 2004. He served more than 20 years for his 
anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist, anti-authoritarian views. The charges 
against him were adding escape, assault on police officer, conspiracy to 
effect escape and bank expropriations. He is currently staying in a half way 
house and looking for a job. To be able to continue on parole, i.e. to 
remain free he must find himself a job and place to live. Both take money.

Larry participated in the �Arts and Writings Against the Death Penalty� 
project which raised funds for Mumia Abu Jamal�s legal defense.  Political 
prisoners from around the US and from other countries would donate their 
writings, poetry, paintings, drawings, ceramics, etc to be exhibited at art 
galleries, universities, churches etc throughout the US and other countries. 
Funds raised from those that were sold were sent to Mumia�s legal defense. 
Larry contributed a number of wonderful paintings. We found out just what a 
creative and generous person he is. And now its our turn to be generous.

Please help Larry remain free and get on his feet by sending your tax 
deductible donation (check or money order made out to IFCO/Prolibertad, with 
Larry Giddings written in the memo section) to address below. Thank you

Many of you may have known George personally; for others this may be the 
first you have heard of this IRA-gunrunning, socialist legend.

George was one of those Irish immigrants that refused to fade "from Green to 
White" as they crossed the Atlantic Ocean.  Ever the good socialist, George 
consistently took courageous stands against racism and US Imperialism.  He 
never shied away from supporting the liberation struggles of oppressed 
peoples here in the US simply because it upset the more conservative 
elements in the Irish community.  In fact, he seemed to relish in upsetting 
these elements.  I met George through the work of building an anti-racist, 
anti-imperialist pole within the Irish community in New York.  Too often 
racism went unchallenged within the community so long as someone had the 
correct "Brit's out" line relating to the north of Ireland.  George was an 
inspiration to myself and many others in challenging that attitude and 
helping to build support within the Irish community for Cuba, Mumia 
Abu-Jamal, and for Puerto Rican independence.   We have truly lost an elder 
in the fight for social justice, self-determination and socialism.  I hope 
you will take this moment to remember George as he would want to be 
remembered:  by rededicating ourselves to the struggle...George Harrison 
Presente!

George's Memorial will be held on October 20th at 6:30pm at Local 1199, 210 
W.43rd St. (between 8th  &amp; 9th Avenues, NYC).  The speakers confirmed at 
this point are:  Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, David Dinkins, Jimmy Breslin, 
and Dennis Rivera.

Unfortunately, George never wrote his autobiography.  A friend once told me 
that when he tried to sit him down to do oral history, George would only 
talk about Mumia and Fidel--never himself. Below are a couple of articles 
about George and his illustrious career.  For more information on George's 
life and politics see The American Connection by Jack Holland, chapter 5 "Of 
Arms and the Man." (Amazon has copies for $3 bucks!)

Saturday Oct. 30th, 2004 at 7pm
Hostos Community College Auditorium
149th and Grand Concourse

On October 27, 1974, over 20,000 people gathered at Madison Square Garden, 
demanding the freedom of our then political prisoners and the independence 
of Puerto Rico. With giant pictures of our nationalist heroes and our 
heroine, Lolita Lebron hanging from above, progressive and oppressed sectors 
of the North American society and over ten UN delegations.  Event was  
historical in countless other ways.

It was the first time in this country that 20,000 people came together to 
demand the freedom for our Puerto Rican Nationalist  and freedom for our 
nation.  It also proved beyond doubt the Puerto Rican community could be 
mobilized and the power of good organization  can have in mobilizing it.
However the most impressive aspect of the activity was fact that the 
majority of the people that filled the Garden  that day came from within our 
communities and from workplaces as far as Gary, Indiana where had Puerto 
Ricans had migrated to work in the steel industry.

This gathering  was the product of an intensive educational and 
organizational effort  undertaken by the members of the  Puerto Rican  
Socialist Party(PSP) �Seccional� or section of the party organized here in 
the belly of the beast in conjunction with progressive sectors in this 
country. The program included solidarity messages from representatives of 
these sectors including Dr. Angela Davis
The effort would  establish and consolidate the political and organizational 
presence of the PSP in our communities and in a number of workplaces 
resulting  in perhaps the biggest independence and socialist  Puerto Rican 
organization in this country. It continued with  a period of numerous 
struggles in many fronts from housing rent strikes to union organizing.  
Additionally   it would provide the basis and the motor for what was later 
to be the massive Bicentennial with out Colonies march held in Washington DC 
two years later in 1976.

On October 30th 2004 we will hold another gathering, this time to celebrate 
the 30th anniversary of the �Acto en el Garden� as is sometimes refered to. 
As in the 1974 activity Juan Mari Bras will be the main speaker. Juan Mari 
will be joined by representatives of some of the progressive forces in this 
country and will culminate with a cultural activity by Roy Brown.

Unfortunately not all  those who accompanied us thirty years ago will be at 
Hostos but perhaps this coming together even if you were not there the first 
time, can serve to recoup our energies, optimism and  will to continue the 
many struggles as the Garden rally did thirty years ago. Remember to join us 
on October 30th 2004, at 7:00 pm at Hostos Community College on 149th Street 
and Grand Concourse in the Bronx.

Larry Giddings, an anti authoritarian political prisoner was released on
parole in August, 2004. He served more than 20 years for his
anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist, anti-authoritarian views. The charges
against him were adding escape, assault on police officer, conspiracy to
effect escape and bank expropriations. He is currently staying in a half way
house and looking for a job. To be able to continue on parole, i.e. to
remain free he must find himself a job and place to live. Both take money.

Larry participated in the �Arts and Writings Against the Death Penalty�
project which raised funds for Mumia Abu Jamal�s legal defense.  Political
prisoners from around the US and from other countries would donate their
writings, poetry, paintings, drawings, ceramics, etc to be exhibited at art
galleries, universities, churches etc throughout the US and other countries.
Funds raised from those that were sold were sent to Mumia�s legal defense.
Larry contributed a number of wonderful paintings. We found out just what a
creative and generous person he is. And now its our turn to be generous.

Please help Larry remain free and get on his feet by sending your tax
deductible donation (check or money order made out to IFCO/Prolibertad, with
Larry Giddings written in the memo section) to address below. Thank you

Many of you may have known George personally; for others this may be the
first you have heard of this IRA-gunrunning, socialist legend.

George was one of those Irish immigrants that refused to fade "from Green to
White" as they crossed the Atlantic Ocean.  Ever the good socialist, George
consistently took courageous stands against racism and US Imperialism.  He
never shied away from supporting the liberation struggles of oppressed
peoples here in the US simply because it upset the more conservative
elements in the Irish community.  In fact, he seemed to relish in upsetting
these elements.  I met George through the work of building an anti-racist,
anti-imperialist pole within the Irish community in New York.  Too often
racism went unchallenged within the community so long as someone had the
correct "Brit's out" line relating to the north of Ireland.  George was an
inspiration to myself and many others in challenging that attitude and
helping to build support within the Irish community for Cuba, Mumia
Abu-Jamal, and for Puerto Rican independence.   We have truly lost an elder
in the fight for social justice, self-determination and socialism.  I hope
you will take this moment to remember George as he would want to be
remembered:  by rededicating ourselves to the struggle...George Harrison
Presente!

George's Memorial will be held on October 20th at 6:30pm at Local 1199, 210
W.43rd St. (between 8th  &amp; 9th Avenues, NYC).  The speakers confirmed at
this point are:  Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, David Dinkins, Jimmy Breslin,
and Dennis Rivera.

Unfortunately, George never wrote his autobiography.  A friend once told me
that when he tried to sit him down to do oral history, George would only
talk about Mumia and Fidel--never himself. Below are a couple of articles
about George and his illustrious career.  For more information on George's
life and politics see The American Connection by Jack Holland, chapter 5 "Of
Arms and the Man." (Amazon has copies for $3 bucks!)

Saturday Oct. 30th, 2004 at 7pm
Hostos Community College Auditorium
149th and Grand Concourse

On October 27, 1974, over 20,000 people gathered at Madison Square Garden,
demanding the freedom of our then political prisoners and the independence
of Puerto Rico. With giant pictures of our nationalist heroes and our
heroine, Lolita Lebron hanging from above, progressive and oppressed sectors
of the North American society and over ten UN delegations.  Event was
historical in countless other ways.

It was the first time in this country that 20,000 people came together to
demand the freedom for our Puerto Rican Nationalist  and freedom for our
nation.  It also proved beyond doubt the Puerto Rican community could be
mobilized and the power of good organization  can have in mobilizing it.
However the most impressive aspect of the activity was fact that the
majority of the people that filled the Garden  that day came from within our
communities and from workplaces as far as Gary, Indiana where had Puerto
Ricans had migrated to work in the steel industry.

This gathering  was the product of an intensive educational and
organizational effort  undertaken by the members of the  Puerto Rican
Socialist Party(PSP) �Seccional� or section of the party organized here in
the belly of the beast in conjunction with progressive sectors in this
country. The program included solidarity messages from representatives of
these sectors including Dr. Angela Davis
The effort would  establish and consolidate the political and organizational
presence of the PSP in our communities and in a number of workplaces
resulting  in perhaps the biggest independence and socialist  Puerto Rican
organization in this country. It continued with  a period of numerous
struggles in many fronts from housing rent strikes to union organizing.
Additionally   it would provide the basis and the motor for what was later
to be the massive Bicentennial with out Colonies march held in Washington DC
two years later in 1976.

On October 30th 2004 we will hold another gathering, this time to celebrate
the 30th anniversary of the �Acto en el Garden� as is sometimes refered to.
As in the 1974 activity Juan Mari Bras will be the main speaker. Juan Mari
will be joined by representatives of some of the progressive forces in this
country and will culminate with a cultural activity by Roy Brown.

Unfortunately not all  those who accompanied us thirty years ago will be at
Hostos but perhaps this coming together even if you were not there the first
time, can serve to recoup our energies, optimism and  will to continue the
many struggles as the Garden rally did thirty years ago. Remember to join us
on October 30th 2004, at 7:00 pm at Hostos Community College on 149th Street
and Grand Concourse in the Bronx.

Dear Friends,

last July 21, only 100 days after his release from two years of
immigration detention.

A brief program at the memorial service will include video footage of
Farouk edited by Konrad Aderer, and speakers including radical attorney
Lynne Stewart. There will also be food and music.

Larry Giddings, an anti authoritarian political prisoner was released on
parole in August, 2004. He served more than 20 years for his
anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist, anti-authoritarian views. The charges
against him were adding escape, assault on police officer, conspiracy to
effect escape and bank expropriations. He is currently staying in a half way
house and looking for a job. To be able to continue on parole, i.e. to
remain free he must find himself a job and place to live. Both take money.

Larry participated in the Arts and Writings Against the Death Penalty
project which raised funds for Mumia Abu Jamals legal defense.  Political
prisoners from around the US and from other countries would donate their
writings, poetry, paintings, drawings, ceramics, etc to be exhibited at art
galleries, universities, churches etc throughout the US and other countries.
Funds raised from those that were sold were sent to Mumias legal defense.
Larry contributed a number of wonderful paintings. We found out just what a
creative and generous person he is. And now its our turn to be generous.

Please help Larry remain free and get on his feet by sending your tax
deductible donation (check or money order made out to IFCO/Prolibertad, with
Larry Giddings written in the memo section) to address below. Thank you

Larry Giddings, an anti authoritarian political prisoner was released on
parole in August, 2004. He served more than 20 years for his
anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist, anti-authoritarian views. The charges
against him were adding escape, assault on police officer, conspiracy to
effect escape and bank expropriations. He is currently staying in a half way
house and looking for a job. To be able to continue on parole, i.e. to
remain free he must find himself a job and place to live. Both take money.

Larry participated in the �Arts and Writings Against the Death Penalty�
project which raised funds for Mumia Abu Jamal�s legal defense.  Political
prisoners from around the US and from other countries would donate their
writings, poetry, paintings, drawings, ceramics, etc to be exhibited at art
galleries, universities, churches etc throughout the US and other countries.
Funds raised from those that were sold were sent to Mumia�s legal defense.
Larry contributed a number of wonderful paintings. We found out just what a
creative and generous person he is. And now its our turn to be generous.

Please help Larry remain free and get on his feet by sending your tax
deductible donation (check or money order made out to IFCO/Prolibertad, with
Larry Giddings written in the memo section) to address below. Thank you

News Bulletin: November 19, 2004

U.S. Parole Commission Weighs Continuing Supervision of Former Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners

On September 10, 2004, Edwin Cort�s, Elizam Escobar, Ricardo Jim�nez, Adolfo
Matos, Dylcia Pag�n, Alberto Rodr�guez, Ida Luz (Lucy) Rodr�guez,
Alejandrina Torres, and Carmen Valent�n marked the fifth anniversary of
their historic release from U.S. prisons. When president Clinton commuted
their disproportionate sentences, he deemed they had served two-thirds of
their sentences, making them eligible to serve the remaining third under the
supervision of the U.S. Parole Commission. Their supervision would last
until 2008 or 2009, unless the Parole Commission terminated the supervision
earlier. After the fifth anniversary, the Parole Commission may not continue
supervision unless it is determined, after a hearing, that such supervision
should not be terminated because there is a likelihood that the person will
engage in conduct violating any criminal law.

Today we learned that the Parole Commission has decided that it will not
accede to early termination of supervision, but that it will proceed to a
hearing, in spite of the fact that both of the supervising U.S. Probation
Officers recommended early termination; in spite of the fact that there is
no evidence that any of these men and women will engage in conduct violating
any criminal law; and in spite of the fact that we provided the Parole
Commission with extensive documentation of their successful integration into
civil society, including letters of support from their employers, as well as
elected officials and civic and religious leaders from Puerto Rico and the
U.S.

Hearings will be scheduled in San Juan and Chicago, to be presided over by
representatives of the Parole Commission. Their regulations provide for due
process, including that the right to be apprised of the evidence and the
right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. We have already
formally requested that we be apprised of the evidence they intend to
introduce against each of the former political prisoners; and we have
indicated our intention to exercise the right to confront and cross-examine
any and all adverse witnesses.

News Bulletin: November 19, 2004

U.S. Parole Commission Weighs Continuing Supervision of Former Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners

On September 10, 2004, Edwin Cort�s, Elizam Escobar, Ricardo Jim�nez, Adolfo
Matos, Dylcia Pag�n, Alberto Rodr�guez, Ida Luz (Lucy) Rodr�guez,
Alejandrina Torres, and Carmen Valent�n marked the fifth anniversary of
their historic release from U.S. prisons. When president Clinton commuted
their disproportionate sentences, he deemed they had served two-thirds of
their sentences, making them eligible to serve the remaining third under the
supervision of the U.S. Parole Commission. Their supervision would last
until 2008 or 2009, unless the Parole Commission terminated the supervision
earlier. After the fifth anniversary, the Parole Commission may not continue
supervision unless it is determined, after a hearing, that such supervision
should not be terminated because there is a likelihood that the person will
engage in conduct violating any criminal law.

Today we learned that the Parole Commission has decided that it will not
accede to early termination of supervision, but that it will proceed to a
hearing, in spite of the fact that both of the supervising U.S. Probation
Officers recommended early termination; in spite of the fact that there is
no evidence that any of these men and women will engage in conduct violating
any criminal law; and in spite of the fact that we provided the Parole
Commission with extensive documentation of their successful integration into
civil society, including letters of support from their employers, as well as
elected officials and civic and religious leaders from Puerto Rico and the
U.S.

Hearings will be scheduled in San Juan and Chicago, to be presided over by
representatives of the Parole Commission. Their regulations provide for due
process, including that the right to be apprised of the evidence and the
right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. We have already
formally requested that we be apprised of the evidence they intend to
introduce against each of the former political prisoners; and we have
indicated our intention to exercise the right to confront and cross-examine
any and all adverse witnesses.

Oscar Lopez Rivera:  A Special Interview for Claridad
Eduardo Villanueva/Special to Claridad Newspaper Translated by Frank Velgara 
of ProLibertad

Today, October 15, 2004, Terre Haute, Indiana, in the U.S., I am visiting 
and conversing with Oscar Lopez Rivera, one of our political prisoners and a 
remnant of the days of  The Cold War.

He is 61 years old, small in build and has the stature of our traditional 
Puerto Rican peasant farmers.  He has a strong complexion with black eyes 
that glitter sharply and seem to be deeply piercing like the scalpel of an 
experienced surgeon.  He has a full mustache that he takes care of 
meticulously and a well combed pony tail in his hair that is barely 
noticeable in the scarce hair on his strikingly strong head.

His innate timidity falls away after breaking the ice and he embarks on a 
profound conversation which is logical, coherent and ingenious and seems to 
negate the effects of 23 years of incarceration.  During these 23 years, he 
served 12 years in Marion one of the cruelest and most inhumane prisons in 
the world.  He has been deprived of physical contact, and limited in his 
phone calls and visits in an attempt to break an indomitable spirit that is 
always with him and is reflected in each action in his rich and complex 
life.

He is a man of courage, self-taught, and disciplined.  He is willing to 
methodically organize the oppressed masses that languish in the Diaspora in 
the United States and who are suffocated by racism and the hatred that 
imperialism unleashes against all those who challenge its hegemony.

From the beginning you are impressed that throughout an extensive 
conversation that covers topics such as history, literature, sports, 
sociology and spiritual agnosticism, you seem to be with a Catholic 
Protestant, who is not interested in fishing for votes.  You don�t hear 
complaints, pessimism, feelinga of hatred or resentment coming from the 
suffering he has had to endure because of his love of the homeland and his 
revolutionary vocation.  Oscar never complains nor does he engage in long 
lamentations of all that he has had to suffer in prison because of his 
ideals.

Few people know in detail the physical isolation and sensory deprivation 
that he was subjected to at Marion.  Few also know what the jailers at 
Florence subjected Oscar to during his first 6 years of imprisonment there.  
For 58 days they woke him every 30 minutes with a bright light in order to 
deprive him of any rest and to prevent him from getting any uninterrupted 
sleep.  These are barbaric acts that only a spirit who is committed to the 
highest ideals of freedom can endure in the name of the love for his people.

Few people in the so-called free community are better informed than Oscar 
about the reality of his country.  He is familiar with all the ideological 
tendencies in the independence movement, their views and leaders, their 
weaknesses and strengths.   He recognizes the persistence, honesty, 
dedication and patriotism of leaders whose activity he has followed and 
carefully studied.   He condemns that fact that some political movements 
have become so bureaucratized and sometimes to the point of risking 
disappearing altogether.  But he recognizes that the diversity of the 
struggle and implementation of tactics and strategy have made it impossible 
for the empire to exterminate us despite all their repressive strategies and 
actions. They have been unleashed against us and are directed at violating 
our civil rights and our right to self-determination.

By listening respectfully and reflecting on his thinking and views, you can 
clearly come to understand why his jailers and U.S. intelligence agencies 
fear him to the point that they fabricated a supposed escape attempt in 
order to lengthen his sentence to 78 years in jail which is what it is 
today.

Oscar enjoys writing to the youth with whom he is in contact.  They  benefit 
from his teaching abilities and his self-taught knowledge.  Some professors 
invite Oscar to contact their students so that they can deepen their 
understanding of the political process in Puerto Rico, colonialism, the 
anti-imperialist struggle, the need for revolutionary changes and the 
dialectical process that allows a political prisoner to transform his 
incarceration and his separation from his loved ones into an experience of 
liberation and personal growth.

Oscar is very aware of his role as a patriotic role model although he 
doesn�t mention it or brag about it.  That is why in his writings he is 
careful not to promote farfetched or irresponsible ideas and to reject ideas 
that promote any personality cult. He rejects this because he considers it 
pure vanity and because he has learned from the negative impact that it has 
had in the ongoing revolutionary  struggle for social change as it pertains 
to other political leaders.

In thinking about his role with youth I would dare say  that Oscar believes 
as does Benedetti that: �the moral health and spiritual clarity of a young 
person will be the probable guarantee that the continuation of life will 
likely be clean and honest� (Benedetti, Memoria y Esperanza, P�g. 28).

I reflect upon the experience of being in such intense proximity to the soul 
of an incarcerated patriot and I think of the inexorable and 
incomprehensible absurdity that the freedom of the homeland demands such 
painful steps in its movement forward -- the existence of political 
prisoners.  I believe that today as always the people have a moral 
obligation to demand that they all return home.
