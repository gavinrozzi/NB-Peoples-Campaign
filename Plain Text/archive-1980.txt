Actually, this is the point.  The People's Campaign can win the election. secondly if
we lose it is the same people in office who would have been there anyway.  The point

The slogan of revolutionary democracy should be
"Abolish the electorial college, let the popular vote decide!"

I think that this crisis in bourgeois democracy provides us a great
opportunity to advance direct democracy.  A poll published in todays
papers cited 80% of the population is oppossed to the electorial
college. Agitation, Education, and organization around this call could
be very effective.

The arguement that Jeremy makes is somewhat common. My mom told me she heard Cokie
Roberts (I don't know if that how to spell her name) make a similar arguement. I think
that it needs to be addressed.  The only thing that I can say about it without doing
more study is that usually the protection of the minority from tyranny of the majority
has little to do with protecting national or ethinic minorities and more to do with
protecting the property owning minority.
NJFO is orgainizing a discussion/study group on the electorial college.  On friday
dec. 1.  The idea is to come together to look at the history and the various lines on
the electorial college.

Democracy and the Presidential Elections

     The current crisis surrounding the presidential elections
highlights one of the many undemocratic features of the United States:
the electoral college.  In terms of the popular vote Gore leads Bush 2
by nearly 200,000 votes yet because of the electoral college it is
possible for Bush 2 to become president and lose the popular vote.
     Article Two of the U.S. Constitution explains how the electoral
college works. It also explains how the President will be chosen by the
House of Representatives if no candidate gains a majority of electors.
The move to the House of Representatives rather than to the popular vote
betrays the actual intention of the electoral college which is to
provide a fail safe in case of a popular upsurge against the propertied
interests of the minority.
     This crisis provides us with opportunity to raise the level of
struggle for democracy;  that is one person one vote.  A recent Gallup
poll found that 8 out of 10 people think that the electoral college
should be abolished. The time is ripe for petitions calling for a
national referendum to amend the constitution and abolish the electoral
college.  This struggle would also allow us to call into question other
undemocratic forms like the Senate, and appointed judges. The Senate as
Thomas Jefferson pointed out is based on the British model of a House of
Lords and a House of Commons.
     Not only do we need a third party allied with the middle class but
rooted in the working class, we need to abolish the entire winner take
all system. A parliamentary system where there is representation based
on the percentage of votes won would be a tremendous advance for
revolutionary democracy. This "crisis" is our opportunity.

     Actually Hitler was well financed by not only the German big bourgeois but also
some Americans (Henry Ford for instance).  An explaination of Hitler's financing is
available in a book called "Who Financed Hitler".  .
     The point that the big bourgeois would prefer bourgeois democracy to outright
dictatorship I think is true.  Just look at them in the US they love to debate among
themselves on all sorts of things.  The reason the big bourgeois supported the
dicatorship of Hitler was first, they feared a working class revolution.  Their fear
was based not only on the victory of the proletariat in the Soviet Union but also on
the fact that the working class had taken state power in Germany in 1918.  Secondly,
Hitler gave the big bourgeois complete control over the economy.  Historically
speaking fascism attacks a retreating working class a kick 'em when their down kind of
thinking. R. Palm Dutt explains this in his book Fascism and Social Revolution.  He
uses the example of Italy, Austria and Germany to make a pretty convincing case.  All
three countries went fascist but only after the working class had  state power within
or in its grasp, only to be betrayed by its social democratic "leaders".
     I think that it is a mistake to say that fascism is the "primacy of politics over
economics".  In fact, I think it would be the other way around.  Fascism is the
outright dictatorship of monopoly capital. Humanity becomes completly subordinated to
the needs of big capital.  The needs of capital in times of severe economic crisis are
most easily met through war;  the destruction of the productive forces as a cure to
the economic crisis which is one of overproduction. Nazism is the most extreme form of
barbarous capitalism because it includes not only war as a means of destruction to
solve the economic crisis but genocide as well.

This is my article for upcoming People' Campaign NewsPaper

McGreevy For Governor, New Jersey Must Not Be Bushwhacked

By Keith Joseph

The People's Campaign, progressives, revolutionaries, and anyone
interested in seeing the movement for democracy advance must support
McGreevy this November in the race for governor in New Jersey. Either of
the potential Republican candidates would be a disaster. Not only for
New Jersey but also for the entire nation. The National Republican
leadership has announced that the New Jersey gubernatorial election will
be an opportunity for Bush's appointment as President of the United
States to be legitimated. We can not allow this to happen. We must make
the defeat of the Republicans in this election a protest against Bush's
presidency as well as the electoral college that made it possible.
     The Green Party has threatened to run a candidate despite the fact
Nader's candidacy delivered the people into the bloody hands of Bush.
They continue to posture as progressives yet the results of their
efforts could not be more reactionary. They already assisted in giving
us Bush and now they threaten to do the same in New Jersey.
     Actively participating in McGreevy's campaign would allow the
People's Campaign and progressive forces to build momentum for the local
elections in New Brunswick and Newark in 2002. We will be able to
register voters and also make the connections and build the networks
necessary for our future efforts. The working class and democratic small
businesses, students and professionals are obviously the constituency we
are seeking, it should also be obvious that they are connected in some
way to the Democratic Party. One reason for this is that they understand
the lesser of two evil tactic very clearly. In this country most people
are voting against a politician rather than for one. We too most utilize
the lesser of two evil tactic, as the only way to build our strength,
unity, and organization so that we can actually win democracy. Clearly
and openly uniting with working people and democratic middle classes in
their opposition to Republican reaction at the national and statewide
level is the only path to unity at the local level against Mayor Cahil
in 2002.

Message:

There is a meeting being organized by George Berry, who is the president of the
Tenants association at the projects, for this saturday at 4pm in the community room,
building four. The meeting is to plan the election of a public housing resident to
take their lawful seat on the housing authority.
I think that it would be a good move if the People's Campaign assisted this effort.

Subject:Re: [nbpc] Reparations and Self-determination
Message:

I thought that this was a good discussion. I advocate Self D and Repartaions and Jim
and I have debated it in the past. The discussion was actaully moving forward, and
many times Jim made the case for Self-D without even meaning to. For insatnce when he
says that the overthrow of reconstruction resulted in "pre-modern classes" taking
control of the Soutrh. That is the point, the relationship of Afro-Americans to the US
is not even at the level that should be achieved in democratic anti-feudal
revolutions. Self-D addresses that very point.
However, to say that Jim's analysis is the same as the Klan is an ultra-left error and
a un- informed remark. First of all,  most people are against reparations that's why
we have to struggle for it; otherwise we would already have it. To say that Jim's
analysis is the same as the Klan (even though you did not call him a Klans man) is
counter-revolutionary because it disorganizes the people rather than organize them.
Instead of drawing revolutionary intellectuals and workers closer togther towards
unity around a common platform it pushes them away towards disunity.
I would take it as an extreme insult if someone were to say I had a line analgous to
the Klan given that I identify as a revolutionary, why would you expect Jim to do
otherwise? How does saying he has a line like the Klan educate him or change his mind
or even just contribute meaningfully to the debate?
This is one particular example of an ultra-left trend of which the attack on Curtis is
but another example. This line is sectarian because it creates an enemy where there
was/should/could be an ally.   The defeat of this ultra-left line and its
rectification along Marxist-Leninist lines will be a geat force towards uniting
revolutionarys in New Brunswick and in New Jersey and will go a long way in  defeating
the local Social-Democrat liberal missionary line that dominates NJFO and the People's
Campaign. If you can not maintain even an alliance with people like Jim and Curtis (to
name but two examples) the movemnt will not grow, no one will be organized and we will
have 5  organizations for four  people. Discussion is a good vehicle to bring
ideological clarity and unity but if discussion is just an excuse to force people to
accept your line with verbal abuse it becomes a servant of imperialsim.

Message:


Perhaps I have not been as clear as I could be. As you know I stated
after
the elections in November That we made mistakes. I certainly do not
exclude
myself from those mistakes. I was a member of the streering committe and
the
People's Campaign's candidate.
I do think that it was a mistake to expel Bloc on Lock from the
campaign. I
think that we behaved towards them in the same fashion that they behaved

towards Curtis. Their attacks on Curtis should have been criticized
without
breaking the unity.
I do not think that Curtis's statement to the Home News was a big deal.
I
think that it could have been raised to him that we are fighting the
city
machine and that we need to break it, I think that we could have
discussed
the position of the campaign towards J&J and used his remarks to the
press
to bring more clarity to that issue instead of just attacking Curtis for
his
statemnets. I think that expelling Block on lock was a short term
expedient
answer that dodged struggle rather than facing it head on.
     In terms of the recent discussion I was spreaking of expulsions in
refernce to the decesion to remove bloc on lock from the campaign list
serve. I was at the meeting with you and I clearly remember And I hope
it is
on video for posterity that the discussion to create an new list was
motivated by one desire and only one desire: to expel block on lock. I
am
very confused about it being spun in any other way.
    In terms of a general trend towads expulsions rather than struggle
for
unity, I am speaking about the history of the movemnt in New Brusnwick,
which has been quick to expel and quick to dismiss people who have
decide to
make a contribution in some other fashion or in some other city as if
New
Brunswick were the one and only city in which revolutuionary struggle is

taking place. (Although, at the same time I don't see anything
revolutionary
about being a dentist or herbalist or Ben & Jerry)
   Cliff was expeled from NJFO because of his political line which,
while
it had an ultra-left tendency, also led the struggle against the
formulation
of "Maoism" and "the boycott the '96 election, both are worse line" of
Arthur Henson (which was eagerly taken up by everyone else in that
organization). The given reasons for Cliff's expulsion was (as X
admitted at
the last NJFO meeting) just a pretext.

The tendency to split or expel origniated with Arthur Henson who upon
being
criticized unceremoniously split from U&S. ( as AB put it ran home and
took
his ball with him). X did the same thing when Baraka criticized him.

I am not denying that Bloc on Lock make it very difficult to with them
since
any person you organize can may be attcked as an imperialist agent if
they
do not emrge into the movement fully armed with Block on Locks'
interpretation of Marxism. Nonetheless, I don't think expulsions are
productive. Lenin and Trotsky were in the same Party and Lenin wrote an
article entitled "Judas Trotsky and the Trade Unions". We must struggle
for
unity not splits.

I also think taht it was a mistake to assist Frank Bright's political
aspirations. There is no problem with him being an activist in the
campaign
but in my opinion he had way to much influence over the political line
and
direction of the campaign. This was my mistake as much as anyone else's,
I
think that it was a right error. It was done with only the short term in

mind.

As to the debate over an office/"Center of Democarcy" I attached a copy
of a
simialr project that I worked on two years ago. It was a debacle that I
have
no interest in repeating. I have made many mistakes but I try my best
not to
repeat them.
I don't know if you have seen it before but it might be interesting,
perhaps
a similar budget is being drawn up now. I also have the "Break Even
Anaylsis" if anyone is interested. First time tragedy second time farce
as
they say.

keith,

though i don't agree with your analysis on the direction of the campaign
and
the majority in njfo (missionary work, etc.) I respect your position.
the
difference in positions will work itself out in practice, as we all
know. i
do have a question though:
were you not in the leadership of the campaign around one year ago when
the
decision was made to expel BoL? did you not agree/advocate that position
at
the time based on their actions against the campaign as a whole? have
you
changed your mind and do you now think that was a bad decision? i am
increasingly perplexed with you and matt's use of "expulsion" as a major

trend of the "right-wing" leadership, when both of you were
involved/agreed
to those decisions at the time (thus making you both "right wing" as
well,
no?). It appears that you are taking things out of context, which is to
say
that BoL didn't get kicked out last week.

I misread your e-mail. You didn't make any connection to Shundler.

Message:

To respond to Cliff's comments

I agree. Curtis explaining his position brings clarity, I think Matt's meaning is that
it is unfortunate that Curtis is loyal to the Republicans

I think that NJFO has a responsibility for its lack of clear ideological leadership
and bad political line which came to head in the People's Campaign with support for
bright and suppression of an anti-republican political line and a lack of any
revolutionary polirtical line.

This is true enough although it has already been criticized on numerous occassions

That is how Curtis stated his case and that certainly seems to be in line with the
compassionate conservativism strategy of Shundler/Bush and even the most extreme right
wing section of the Buchanan reform party who even nominated Foster as their VP an
afro-american woman. (although that shopuld also tell us something about the
limitations of "woman" based ideology (ie."sisterhood" as well as black nationalism)

We have numerous ideological differences which in my opinion make joint editorial work
impossible at the moment. (not to mention differences of style. I have a hard time
trusting anyone who doesn't believe in friendship for instance and also a hard time
working with people who do not believe in trust itself.  Those are ultra-ultra left
lines which really resolve as the essence of right-wing ideology see Mussolini, G.
Gordon Liddy, the SA in Nazi Germany for examples).  Joint editorial work is
impossible given our differences as we learned in practice. That is we don't agree on
fundamental issues (in particular reparations (and as a sub heading the inability to
be self-critical) and the woman question and  the idea of an organiztaion whose
ideology is sisterhood is not marxist, it is feminist)  and we wasted mor than one
entire edit board meetings debating these points. To let that continue would have been
the actual sabatage. We discussed working together on production and in fact the last
newspaper SWORD printed/photocopied. Since then  you have made it clear that anything
short of joint work on the edit board constitutes an exploititive relationship. Since
we are not interetsed in knowingly exoploiting anyone nor are we interested in having
an edit board of multifarious trends our current relationship or lack of one is on
you.

As to the continued accusation of sabatage, it is something of a joke. Joe Smith
official spokesman of the oppressed first raised this accusation in his essay "Let the
oppressed speak".  His charge is that Matt did not send HIM articles to lay out
therefore the newspaper is being sabotaged. This is the same muddled super subjective
logic as the title of his piece suggests. Joe has blown up his own subjectyivty to the
point that he belives that his subjectivity is  objectivity (see also above "working
class activists" expelled from Coalition. actually Cliff was expelled and numerous
working calss activist remained in the organization but Cliff believes that not only
does he represent the working calss but that he is the working class)

Looking at the political line of SWORD especially around the issue of the paper and
its production we are actually seeing the ultra-left version of the "office space
community center club house" line. That is placing production and the productive
forces above politics. Joe nor Cliff is concerned with the political line of the
newspaper just "come out with it" "where is it" "hurry up" new and improved
revolutionary newsaper faster stronger better than before.

Joe wrote an article, that has been endlessly defended, that stated white workers need
reparations along with afro-americans. I am not interested in putting out that
political line. Nor am I interested in putting out political lines endorsing
"sisterhood".  Politics must lead production not the other way around. Production
before politics is the theory of sponatinety and the essence of economism (see "What
is To be done")

If SWORD wants to help put out the political line of the U&S editorial board than
let's go, but if they insist on being a part of the edit board then first we must come
to ideological resolutions. From what has already been sd SWORD believes that helping
with production is exploitation. We certainly do not intend to exploit anyones
resources.

> "scientific socialists dismiss "luck".

Actually, luck is part of that which can not be understood at present or predicted
with accuracy. For instance wheather at a rally.

> unite, don't split

"....First of all, we are discussing party literature and its subordination to party
control. Everyone is free to write and say whatever he likes, without restrictions.
But every voluntary association (including the party) is also free to expel memers who

press must be complete. But then freedom of association must be complete too..."

I'm not sure exactly what your saying, but as to my boss robbing me or any boss
robbing anyone,  that it is not the issue of reparations. You are confusing two
distinct things. Reparations for afro-americacans are repeartions for chattel slavery.
Reparations is one of the ways to create equality among the multi-national working
calss so that unity is easier to achieve. If white workers throughout the U&S got
repartions along with afro-american workers then the relationship would not change.You
are making the demand for reparations a demand for socialism.

When the coalition existed it was primarily a working class organization. If you are
gloating about its demise I don't know what to tell you.

I don't know what that sentence is refering to.

That's my line, I don't think that you answered it.

I raised the question of putting froward the paper collectively very specificly in the
piece to whihc you responded.
the issue is:
1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board is one trend.
2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.

As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working relationship that you
feel is non-exploitative.

I don't think that we both know my "practice is out to lunch". If this were the case
than why would you be so eager to unite with it?

Actaully I don't think that you know much about my practice.

 We re-scheduled the meeting because Baraka was not going to be in town on the
original date and you came to that meeting
.
I especially like the super subjective grandiose vision of yrself.  " i don't see
reason that there would be any production going on at all."  Are you also actaully the
emobiement of Reason that travels throughout history on whose behalf all people are
acting?

You can make the criticism untill the cows come home. Your proposal for rectification
is to expel the republicans and re-admit you.
I already sd that I agree republicans should be expelled from the organization and
that SWORD should be united with in the People's Campaign.But I think that it is more
important that the majority of people involved with the camapign understand what is
happening and what mistakes were made, otherwise they will just be repeated (maybe
with an ultra-left cover).

I think that you are just repeating yrself here, but again maybe I'm blinded by
ignorance if so please cast the light. Otherwise see my reply above.

I think that this is the same again.
But I do have a question. What is "the peoples productive development"?

I tried to answer the isues you raise, but since this reply is a little lengthy, I
would reiterate this point as being central:

1. unity on the edit board requires ideological unity, the edit board is a single
trend.
2. joint work on production was called "exploitative" by your brother.

As far as I am concerned it is on you to propose some working relationship that you
feel is non-exploitative. First, editorial unity is not possible until there is a
change in political line.Secondly,  if the current relationship is termed
"exploitative" then it must change. There's the problem. I have made more than one
proposal for its solution. As far as I am concerned its on you.

Joe,
You claimed that a number of people myself included have sabotaged U&S for numerous
years. That is a outright lie, but if you are going to say it at least try to put
forward some evidence to back up your claim. Otherwise as I sd you are the manure of
cointelpro. which doesn't mean you are a part of it but its fertilizer.
As far as distrobution of the paper goes, I don't know what your last comment means,
so know I don't comprende.
please elaborate.

Message:

Joe,
yr slogan "Reperations for the multi-national working class!!" is trotskyism.
U&S put forward and has been struggling for reperations for slavery for the
afro-american nation. Your slogan liquidates the demand and operates under the
unstated assumption that equality has already been achieved among the multi-natuional
working class- that's trotskyism. The slogan is militant reformism. It makes no
distinction between the minimum and maximum program but actually collapses the two.
Maybe yr rrrrrrevolutionary practice should include studying marxism-leninism.

Cliff,
I think there is some agreement on the points you raise, but I don't see where you
point forward a concrete solution.

agreed, we actually attempted to publish the essay that you wrote, but it is over 2000
words. which is 4 times the longest running article. I didn't think that it would be
fair to except it without yr input. If you could summarize yr position in under 500 or
break into a series of articles that we could publish and respond to we will put it
out in the next issue.

agreed, but this does not speak to how our relationship is going to work in practice.

I don't think that the question of politics over production is superficial,
disingenous or dishonest. Frist, we have been dealing with that line from the right
(former NJFO, People's Campaign) for many months. The answer is a simplistic
insistence on practice and a refusal to discuss what that practice is going to be, it
has resolved into anarchistic "everyone do what they want because we don't want o talk
about it or defend our veiws".  The situation between us is a little different, but
there has certianly been the same emphasis on "getting out a paper" from comrades on
yr end. The paper at the moment has at best a distrobution between 1-2 thousand. Its a
start and better than nothing. But I would rather it be delayed a month and have a
better political line and be a better paper than be rushed out. Henson was the hero of
production over politics We have stacks of paper that not only didn't get moved but
that suck and few would read if they did. The majority of artuicles are  badly written
are  boring and sloganeering, I am not interested in repeating that. On the other hand
I'm not saying taht production is not important or taht it doesn't need to move
forward. The paper will not get better by meeting about it but by getting it out, but
at the moment the principle thing is to consolidate its political line. (the paper
should be out by the monday or tues).

I think we agree on the definition of reparations. The slogan we put forward doesn't
reduce the concept of reparations to one relation rather we are applying the general
conecpt to a particular relation. You seem to be saying because we uphold reparations
for chattel slavery we should uphold every conceivable demand for reparations. We may
have abbreviated our demand for reparations for cahttel slavery and stated simply
reparations, if that was unclear we no doubt can always make our selves clearer. But
our line is repartions for the afro-american nation.
Ras made the point at the meeting on June 20th that the reality of yr call for
reparations for women is reparations for men   as well at least to the extent that
they are married or co-habitat as in a family. That is if Lou were to get reperations
I would benifit as well. for instance.

at the moment we are developing a cohesive platform. Though U&S has put forward on
more than one occassion that the primary struggle of women is for equal rights. That
is to have the full benifits of the bourgeois democratic stage of the revolution. The
socialization of housework etc. in my opinion is something that can be struggled for
now as well but that it will be a part of the transformation to socialism. In my
opinion the height of the women's movemnt was around the struggle for the ERA and it
has been narrowed to pro-choice. The is not to belittle the struggle for reproductive
rights but I would add that that struggle should include the right to have a healthy
child (pre-natal care, health care, child care etc).

I think that yr insistence on the term "sex" as oppossed to "gender" is
meta-physical.(the general accusation against U&S is based on one article. And just to
remind at least those who remember of the pre-judice against U&S on this question it
was believed that the sentence on gender oppression in Revolutionaries Unite.. was
added after its intial publication, though that was not true)  The opression of women
takes both forms. Sex oppression having to do with reproduction while it may be the
basis of gender oppression does not reduce to it.

I am not against sisterhood and struggle. I don't believe that it is marxism-leninsm,
I think that it is feminism. I'm not against NOW either.
But what is SWORD's position.

I don't dismiss BNF, I don't think  they themselves claim Marxism-Leninism as their
ideology, though I know they are not "anti-marxist".  Sold out women doesn't eliminate
women's oppresion but it does eliminate "sisterhood".

Actually, the workers who your boss organizes have no real choice. our unity is
voluntary.
You claimed that the relatuionship was exploitive. Exploitation is theft, now you are
claiming taht it is a "productive contribution".
You can't have it both ways, is it a contribution or is it exploitation?
What is the relationship that you would recommend?
I sd that it is our opinion that the diferences we have ideologically made joint work
on the edit board impossible. There must be substantial differences otherwise the
people already there could adequately represent yr political line.
To resolve those diffrences we suggested public forums and are agreeable to polemics
in the paper and even opn e-mail lists.
As to joint productive work it is on you still to define that relationship, since we
refuse to be in a relationship and than be accussed of exploiting anyone.

so as far as I am concerned the two issues that I raised intailly remain to be
answered, and I still think that it is on you.

Cliff,

I think that I explained this in another e-mail. But if you want to raise a demand for
repartaions outside of that one you should start by making it clear and distinct
rather than have it collapseing the two. The point is that reparations for chattle
slavery is a specific demand that shouldn't be confused with other demands that have
other purposes.

The point is that  they are separate and distinct demnads. U&S support for reparations
for chattel slavery does not imply support or lack of for any other form of
reperations. They are seperate.

Cliff, we tried to woirk together on the edit board and from my point of veiw it
proved impossible because the points that we disagreed upon are the most important
points to SWORD. That is they were raised over and over again to the point were
editorial work that needed to get done did not.

We will try to be as specific as possible. BUt I don't think that U&S is the forum to
unite Marxist-Leninist and feminists for instance although we can and should work
together on other projects.
I agree that there is some lack of clarity around this and I hope that we can become
clear.

Jeremy and anyone else interetsed,

You sd Marxism is feminist. I assume that you don't mean reduces to feminism but
somehow encompasses it. However there needs to be some distinction drawn. While there
are a wide variety of feminist ideologies they have some basic assumptions in common.
First, that the primary struggle in history is between men and women rather than
social classes, or at least that the struggle between men and women is more
significant. Secondly that there is a source of the oppression/exploitation of women
other than private property that plays a definitive role, usually some kind of
biological determinism.
As oppossed to the arguemnt that Engels makes in the "Origins of the Family, Private
Property and the State". He argues basing himself on the anthrology of Morgan, that
there was a time before the emergence of private property that women and men were
basicly equal. He argues that whatever division of labor existed didn't necessitate
any inequality. For Marxism the origins of the oppression of women are found in the
rise of private property and likewise the emancipation of women is connected to the
overthrow of private property. Feminism usually doesn't have any story to tell about
the emancipation of women.

    so if  you mean to say that Marxism is concerned about the emancipation of women
and sees that as a part of its project, I agree. But I do think that there are
important distinctions between Marxism and feminism.

Subject:Re: [nbpc] BURY schundler
Message:

Cliff,
the "proof" is this:
"Reperations for the multi-national working class!!" -Joe Smith

as I wrote below that line is a liquidation of the national question. This shouild be
obvious to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Marxism-Leninism.

again
since we have ideological disagreements, this being a case in point, and since you
feel that our relationship was exploitive how are we going to work togther?
I am starting to think that you are avoiding the point.

Message:

My question is directed at Joe or Cliff,

Since we have ideological disagreements that prevent us from jointly working on the
edit board of U&S and since you have stated that our previuos relationship was
exploitation, what do you propose to do?
this is not a rhetorical question. I would sincerely like to know.

Keith

Message:

Joe,
this statement of yours:
"the threats i received by manny and letti are not forgotten, you
want what they got comin? keep talkin'"
is more manure for cointelpro
If you constanly have to resort to meek threats when your ability to make a coherent
arguemnt fails: why would anyone want to work with you on anything?

I think I already asked this question 7 or 8 times but just for kicks I'll ask again:
How do you propose to work together if you think that we are exploiting you?

Keith

Our ideological differences are not in my imaginzation. I assume your point is that
they don't prevent us from working together. I agree with that except that they do
prevent us from working on the edit board together.  That is not a six year mystical
grudge, we had two edit board meetings that degenerated into arguements over very
fundamnetal political lines. While we agree on a number of points we have fundamental
disagreements over the issue of the Afro-American national question and the woman
question. I am all for sorting those differences out in the newspaper but not at the
edit board meetings.

I am not interested in exploiting people who should be my allies. Your response avoids
the point. A claim was made that your organziation was being exploited. I'm not
interested in maintaing such a relationship.

I already asked Cliff but anyone from yr organziation could write something that is
around 300 words and we will respond and print it. I planned to do that with the piece
that Cliff sent but it was 2000 words and I couldn't find a way to break it down. If
you want you could also break down that article into 300-400 word sections and we
could print it as a series with responses.

Here is were you lose me. You can't "ask the same of me". We had a working
relationship and then you said that we were exploiting you. We refuse to be in any
relationship and then be told that we are exploiting people. So that's why I ask you
what you suggest. "We work together" is a little vague. I want to know exactly what is
the relationship going to be that is not exploitative.Then we will  have something to
talk about.

I have been organizing in New Brunswick since the spring of 1994. I worked with yr
brother until the end of 1996. He was expelled from the our organiztion and I
supported that decesion. I have since criticized those decesions and have put forward
what is in my opinion the best explaination of what happened. (since I have sd this
more than once I don't really feel like repeating it agin)  In 2000 we worked togther
again. Again Block on Lock was expelled from the organization. A decesion that I
criticized along with the earlier decesion to expel Cliff. You continue to insist that
there is some kind of conspiracy but the fact remains that I have been pushing to have
sword reinstated to the camapign. It may suit your purpose to conflate the issues iof
the camapaign with the issues of U&S but as far as I am concerned there is a
distinction. U&S has a much higher level of unity than the campaign.
I do deny that I exploit sword and I certainly will not enter into any relationship in
the future and have that accusation be made and remain in the relationship.
We didn't print your line because it was at odds with U&S's line. However, we will
print your line and our response.

Manure is fertilizer. Your comments (threats) create fertile ground for cointelpro
attacks. If you are interested, there are bunch of books that expose the techniques
and tactics that were used. Ward Churchhill wrote a good one called "Agents of
Repression". cointelpro fed upon internal contradictions and they succeeded in having
Black Panthers and members of United Slaves (of which Baraka was the east coast
leader) kill each other.
I lost my cool at the last Kimako's and apologize for screaming, though I didn't
"demand that we fight", I was asking you what the point of pushing the arguement with
Letti was after it was clear that it was not productive. As far as I could tell the
only place pushing the arguement could go was a physical fight. I also sd that telling
people who you are suppossedly trying to unite with that they are "full of shit" is
not a productive way to have a discussion.  And I for one am not particularly
interested in uniting with people who have a hard time grasping that telling someone
they are "full of shit" is not a way to unite.

Again I am not accussing you of being a part of cointelpro I am trying to point out to
you that making threats and writing things like "go fuck yourself" are not only
counter productive but make the movement vulnerable. It is incomprehensible to me that
you would write "go fuck yourself" to someone you wanted to unite with. Are you that
ignorant of dialectics or even normal human interaction that you cannot grasp that "go
fuck yourself" is what you say when you want to split not unite. Isn't that what "go
fuck yourself means"? Doesn't "go fuck yourself" mean: split.


>
> what is a meek threat?

In my opinion, this statement:
 "you want what they got comin? keep talkin'"
is a meek threat, in addition to the manure that I already spoke about.

> we work together just like that keith... WE WORK TOGETHER
> it is you that forever says you can't do it.

Actually, I asked you to propose someting concrete that we could do together around
the paper that doesn't "exploit" you.
That is my proposal but if you are going to continue with the "go fuck yrself" stuff,
then I don't know what to tell you. (actually I do know, but I will wait and see).
Also Manny and Letti are on the edit board of U&S so whatever " they got comin?" means
I don't see how it can advance unity. But like you say "keep talkin".

I think that saying things like " these

Message:

Joe,
I don't know how to join the "members only" list but I would imganie that the
exclusive nature of the list is no longer necessary. I will send a msg. to that list
asking that you be adding or that the restrictions be taken off altogther.
I also wanted to say that I don't think that people need to explain why they voted the
way they did. People have a right to their opinion as well as their vote.
I am hoping that ending the policy of excluding sword will lead to a renewed campaign
not more intensive name calling and accusations.
I think that the main tasks before The People's Camapign are until the November
election are:
1. the defeat of Shundler
2. cricticism/summation of past elctorial effort that concludes in re-orientation and
rectification with a set of POU's and renewed vow to the local platform and the
inclusion of a national platform or at least a committment to developing one.
In my opinion the Campaign without POU's and a commitment to the platform is just
chasing ambulances rather than building a movement.  I already sent out this piece
below but I am sending it again. I am hoping that we can build some unity around it.
I think that it can serve as the begining for a rectification and reorientation.

Keith

What to do?

     Since the February meeting the People's Campaign has become increasing
disoriented and isolated from any base whatsoever. The meetings following February
have been characterized by petty intrigues, petty debates about organizational
structure, expulsions, and a general crisis of identity. I think this state is
recognized by most but few are clear enough or willing enough to admit it. This state
of affairs has come about because of a bad strategy that was initiated at the founding
meeting of the campaign in January of 2000. The strategy that was put into motion at
said meeting was a united front against local the democratic party. This strategy saw
the local democratic party as the main target and then sought allies on that basis
leading us to ally ourselves with republicans among others. Our out look was short
sighted, narrow and parochial.
     Instead of strategizing to build a movement over the long term we thought only in
terms of the upcoming election. This is a recipe for failure and has put us in the
position we are in today. It has confused the organization and those associated with
it to the point of paralysis. The last meetings resolution to have two main objectives
for the campaign (democracy ordinance and mayor's election 2000) is just more
wandering in the wilderness.
     What we need is a ground up re-organization that begins with a sum up of our
success and failures in our last attempt. This must include a critique of the faulty
strategy that I already mentioned and include a new orientation. The new orientation
should begin with a strategy that states clearly that the Republican Party is the main
danger facing working people, students, and the democratic middle classes. (This
should be increasingly obvious as Bush 2 begins to set back the peace and anti-war
movement 30 years by unilaterally withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty,
provoking Russia and China into a renewal of the arms race.)  Being that they are the
main danger they should be opposed independently where possible and in coalition with
the democratic party when necessary. Likewise the democratic party are no friend of
working people and it is our intention to build an independent movement. We will
oppose the democratic party where possible (like in New Brunswick) and unite with them
when there is a greater danger like in the upcoming gubernatorial election. This
should be our stated strategy.
     We must unequivocally cease the bourgeois politician's practice of being all
things to all people. If we alienate some people we will inspire many more. We are
supposed to be political leaders, which means we have to be in front not tailing
behind the most backward sections of the population trying to offend no one.
The essence of our principles of unity should be struggle for People's Democracy.
Defined as majority rule. We want participatory democracy not manufactured consent.
We must be uncompromising when it comes to principles.
    Also a final note as to fund raising since the only nominee for the open steering
committee seat believes that this is the most important issue. Money will come after
we do some good political work. No one is going to give us money to do good political
work. Instead of worrying about fundraising we should worry about build an
organization and a movement with a clear strategy and set of principles. The setting
of fundraising as an ends in itself is a continuation of the  "office community center
democracy clubhouse" line that was defeated both in theory and in practice.

Message:

In my opinion the folowing is a good analysis of why open ideological
struggle is fundamentally important.


The historical experience of proletarian parties, especially of the
Bolshevik Party and the Chinese Communist Party, shows that what is
involved in the disagreements that arise in such parties (even when the
differences seem to be concerned only with �shades of opinion�) is the
working out of a correct political line that can enable the working
class to conquer and then to consolidate its ideological and political
hegemony. In the long run, it is the proletarian character of the party
itself that is at issue. And this character can be lastingly maintained
only if the ideological unity of the party is based on the principles of
revolutionary Marxism, and if the party, in its functioning, respects
these principles, thus constituting a revolutionary vanguard supported
by the working masses.
     The ideological unity of a proletarian revolutionary party cannot
long survive mistakes in its political line: a party which over a long
period follows a non proletarian line must eventually be forced to deny
the principles it swears by, and lose the support of the advanced
elements of the proletariat and the masses. However, a wide discussion
aimed at drawing the lessons of the results practically achieved through
actually applying the political line is essential in order to determine
(especially when no previous experience is available) the more or the
less correct aspects of the line that has been followed, and the
rectifications the line requires in view of the experience acquired and
the changes that have occurred in the objective situation.
     This discussion is needed because there is no �recipe� stating a
priori that a certain measure or a certain slogan does or does not serve
the basic interests of the proletariat�except where obvious violations
of the principles of revolutionary Marxism are concerned. Only a
thorough study of reality, of practice, and of the contending theses
enables the party to decide correctly how to solve the problems posed by
the concrete elaboration of a correct line and by the practical
application of this line. Only respect for democratic
centralism�provided that democracy is its dominant aspect�can enable
those who, though they uphold correct conceptions, are in the minority,
to make themselves heard, if they themselves dare to �go against the
tide.�
      A given political line is proletarian in character only if it does
not violate the principles of revolutionary Marxism: but it must also
correspond effectively to the needs of the actual situation, thus making
it possible to deal correctly�from the standpoint of the
proletariat�with the principal contradiction in the particular situation
prevailing, and with the secondary contradictions which are subordinate
to this one.  In a situation which is evolving quickly, a political line
or slogan that was correct at a particular moment may become wrong quite
soon afterward. For example, the slogan �All Power to the Soviets� was a
correct slogan from February 27 until July 4, 1917, in a period when
armed counter-revolution presented no threat. It ceased to be correct
after July 4 when, as Lenin wrote, �the counter-revolutionary
bourgeoisie, working hand in glove with the monarchists and the Black
Hundreds, secured the support of the petty-bourgeois
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, partly by intimidating them,
and handed over real power to the Cavaignacs, the military gang�[24]
      What applies to a particular slogan or measure applies also to the
concrete political line of a party. This line can be revolutionary and
proletarian only if it corresponds to the needs of the actual situation.
Accordingly, when the situation changes�when, for example, a period of
civil war gives way to a period of peaceful construction�appropriate
changes have to be made in the party line, in the measures the party
takes, and in the slogans it issues.  In order to cope with the demands
facing it, a proletarian party must be able to recognize and rectify in
good time the mistakes it has made.
      A revolutionary party can make mistakes, even serious ones,
without losing its proletarian character, but it loses this character
when it becomes lastingly incapable of recognizing that it has made a
mistake, and of correcting its political line accordingly. The process
of recognizing and rectifying mistakes can develop fully only under
conditions of sufficiently open ideological struggle: without such a
struggle it becomes more and more difficult to work out and apply a
proletarian line, and, in the long run, to preserve the party�s
proletarian character�and also, consequently, if the party is in power,
the proletarian character of the state.
    When, in a proletarian party, several political lines are in
conflict, all of which seem to correspond to the needs of the
revolution, it is only by applying theoretical analysis and concrete
analysis (and so, also, by critically examining past and present
practice) that it becomes possible to decide which of these lines really
best serves the interests of the proletariat. Open discussion, criticism
and self-criticism are thus of very great importance. They make it
possible to carry out analyses which are as thorough as possible, to
appreciate the significance of all the shades of difference, to draw up
a detailed balance sheet, and to deduce lessons from past mistakes, and
thus to rectify past errors.
     As long as social classes exist, the class struggle going on in
society is reflected in the party in the form of ideological and
political struggle. The proletarian line, the one which in the given
situation is best calculated to serve the interests of the proletariat,
is therefore inevitably confronted by a bourgeois line. The latter is
the one which, in the given conditions, serves best the interests of the
bourgeoisie. In relation to the bourgeois and proletarian lines, the
other lines represent right or �left� opportunist orientations. In
circumstances where it corresponds better to the interests of the
bourgeoisie, an opportunist line may become a bourgeois line. At a given
moment, the existence of a definite bourgeois line conceals the
bourgeois content of a particular opportunist tendency, which thus seems
to �blend� with the proletarian line, but will at a later stage come
into open conflict with the latter.
      A correct ideological struggle requires that at each moment the
principal target must be the bourgeois line, without losing sight of the
opportunist tendency. Thus, in November-December 1920, Lenin�s principal
target was the Trotsky-Bukharin opposition: then, when that trend had
been practically beaten, he took as his principal target the Workers�
Opposition. There is no �recipe� for �spotting at first glance� the
bourgeois line of the moment. It is often a line which seems to be
particularly �close� to the revolutionary line, for it is in this way
that a great number of party members can be more easily misled. It may
seem merely to take revolutionary orientations to their �logical
conclusion.� Only when its true class character has been exposed does
the bourgeois line cease to seem �close� to the revolutionary line: but
its place is then inevitably taken by another tendency which, in turn,
seems to �blend� with (or be �indistinguishable from�) the revolutionary
line.  Those who defend a bourgeois line are, objectively,
representatives of the bourgeoisie inside the proletarian party, but
this does not imply that they are its �conscious agents.� One has,
therefore, to start from the assumption that they (and, a fortiori,
those who have merely been influenced by a nonproletarian line) can be
won over to the proletarian line: this is why it is important to �leave
a way out� for those who oppose the proletarian line, provided that they
are not splitting the party and are not playing a double game.
     It is clear, and experience confirms this, that there is no
�guarantee� that a proletarian party will always, at every moment, rally
round the line which is correct from the standpoint of the interests of
the proletariat, the revolutionary line. The definition of the
proletarian revolutionary line can therefore not be left to a mere
�majority vote,� whether in a popular (or workers�) assembly, in a party
congress, or in a meeting of the party�s Central Committee. Experience
shows that, faced with a profoundly new situation, it is usually only a
minority that finds the correct path, even in an experienced proletarian
party. This being so, to suppose that a majority vote can settle
difficulties and decide the correct line would be quite illusory.
Generally speaking, what is correct does not immediately appear as such:
this clarification comes about only after struggle, free discussion,
experience, and the test of time.
     In order that what is new and true may make its way in the world
without too much difficulty, there must be no claiming that what is true
and what is false can be decided by the simplistic method of voting,
when what is involved calls for analysis and discussion. (This does not
rule out the possibility that, where immediate practical decisions are
required, it may be necessary to resort to voting before a problem has
been studied in all its aspects.)  It was not accidental that Lenin was
more than once beaten when votes were taken in the Bolshevik party at
crucial moments, so that he had to �go against the tide.� Mao Tse tung
has stressed that �going against the tide is a Marxist-Leninist
principle.�[25] It is therefore essential that new revolutionary ideas
be given the possibility of being defended, and that those who are the
bearers of these ideas possess the right, and the courage, to defend
them.
The problem of what is true and what is false as regards the conditions
for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat is all the more
difficult to settle because the practice of proletarian rule is
historically in its infancy, as compared with the thousands of years of
experience of rule possessed by the exploiting classes. This is also why
what might have seemed obvious fifty years ago, and which was indeed so
on the basis of experience up to that time and the corresponding
development of theory, may seem today only partly true. Every scientific
truth is capable of developing and getting enriched, thereby becoming a
new truth through the shedding of what, in the �former truth� was really
false.  If the presence within a proletarian party of a majority
favorable to a particular political line, or to certain measures, does
not �guarantee� the proletarian character of this line or these
measures, it is nonetheless necessary, when the moment comes to act and
when the highest party bodies have declared for them, that the minority
submit in action, even while reserving their own opinion so as to be
better able subsequently to correct mistakes. It is only if there are
profound divergences, and if there is no other way to correct the party
orientation, that a split is to be preferred to unity and in this case,
it is those who are violating party principles who bear responsibility
for the split. Naturally, the possibility of correcting mistakes of
orientation becomes more restricted when these mistakes do not emerge
openly but only in the form of a certain practice, that is of an
undeclared opposition

Flavio,

I have no objection to the decesion taken at the June meeting with regard to teh
democracy ordiance the mayor's race and the Schundler camapign.
I just think that the proposal that was passed is not sufficent for principles of
unity. I don't think that it has any strategy for building a movement.
I am only against it to the extent that it is meant to take the place of long term
political goals of building a movemnt for real democracy which in my opinuion is
majority rule.
I put forward my arguement in a piece I just recently e-mailed called "what to do". I
certainly would like toknow what you think of it.

Message:

Jeremy,
One of the reason that I posted the piece you mentioned was that I think that the
campaign has a tendency towards "manufacturing consent" rather than participatory
democracy. Though I wouldn't advocate it for the campaign the ideal of democractic
centralism is that thorough going discussion proceeds decisions and are followed by
unity of action even by dissenters who are not only allowed but encouraged to continue
to raise their dissent in the future. This is ideal for a revolutionary organziation
because it allows unity of action in bloc. But as I said democratic centralism is not
appropriate for the campaign.

Anyway as to this debate, I don't think that the vote last saturday was a perfect
expression of the public will or even democratic principles, however it was a perfect
expression of the form of democrcay that has come to dominate in the People's
Campaign. If one of the results of that decision is a more serious consideration of
what it means to function democratically I would be very happy.

I also feel that the whole issue of democracy within the campaign is being raised at
this time because it is the first time that a certain clique has lost a vote.
Unfortunately this discussion was not happening prior to the latest decision. I think
that the principles that you outlined below would be a fine place to start.

As an ideological aside I think that the liberal idea of democracy is exactly what
Chomsky called "manufacturing consent" the idea of a participatory democracy is
outside of the liberal conception. For the liberal the point of democracy is to be
able to pursue private interests (usually involving some exploiattion) while what I
think that what we want from a working class standpoint or radical democratic if you
prefer is mass participation and an enlargement of the public sphere and public
control resting on the assumption that human beings are social animals and that
co-operation is essential to our survival if we want to live without exploitation,
coercion and oppression.

Since you weren't at the meeting I will add, that I argued to end the expulsion of
sword. I don't agree that what we now need is an interegation of why people voted the
way they did. I understand why people voted the way they did and that is their right.
But to explain my own actions, firstly I opposse on principle the policy of expelling
leftist even if they are ultra-leftist. I think that this was done much to flippantly
in the first place. It is not the practice of Lenin or Mao (not that you care in
particular, but for the record) who worked with Trotsky and the gang of four
respectively even while criticizing them. I won't make a dogma out of it but generally
speaking there should be extraordinary circumstances. I also find it odd that we would
work with republicans and not sword.

A second reason is that there is a very distinct right trend that has emerged in the
campaign. Part of that trend I already mentioned as far as the discussion of
democrcay, some other aspects are the trading of political work for social service (ie
office space club house whatever), the narrowing of the struggle to its the most
parochial features, the repeated attempts to suppress discussion and debate, the
belittling of theory, the refusal to be self-critical etc.

In my opinion these are right wing mistakes that need to be corrected in order to move
forward, I think that sword will be allies in that struggle.

There already exists some kind of code of conduct, if people feel the need to expound
it and include basic things like an end to  profanity and name calling in place of
polemic and discussion, though it seems profoundly childish that we need such things
but I guess practice has proven that we do, I would support that.

I am opposed to explusions that are motivated by desire for personal power or stifling
dissent or eliminating a political line that someone may not agree with but does not
violate our principles of unity or our platform(a note for the slow: the republicans
oppose our platform).

While some members of sword have not been the most reasonable people and often tended
to revert to school yard antics like name calling and profainity, I think that those
tendencies can be criticized and eliminated without expelling the organization.

Subject:Re: [nbpc] Re:Revolutionaries SI! Republicans NO!!
Message:

Flavio,

I support the idea that the campaign be focused on electoral politics. An office for
that is fine though that was not what was voted on at the campaign meeting. It was the
peoples community center for democrac or some such thing. An office with a phone and
photocopier is something else though neither should be put before political work.

I think we also agree that the vote to re-admit sword happened in the same fashion as
very other vote in the campaign.
(you are wrong about eligibility by campaign rules)

But it is interesting that this vote would cause so much discussion about procedure
and little about anything else. Procedure is not suppossed to be a battering ram to
eleimnate political ideas or votes thatyou don't agree with.

I think that the vote on the "community cenetr" was a classic example of manufactured
consent. Some 50 people voted in favor of it never to be heard from again.
how would you explain that.

As far as winning the election in 2002. I think that Joe is right win he says get rid
of the right wing work in the community.
The people of New Brunswick are instinctively anti-republican (and their instincts are
correct) regardless of how many people like Frank Bright.  When we unite with
republicans we give the appearance that we are attacking the local democrats from the
right rather than the left. This was fatal in November 2000 and will be fatal in 2002
if it is not corrected.

Our commitment to electoral politics should look like this. Always opposse
republicans. opposse democrats were we can win, support them when we can't and there
is a greater danger, and work to end the domination of two parties in favor of a
multi-party system.

This is simple and would win us broad support and once we showed its effectiveness in
practice it will be easy to raise money for office space.

It is the only winning strategy for 2002.

The reason for all the confusion and commotion is that we can not have a broad
discussion of this question to re-order the camapaign on the footing the I set forth
above. So we inch foward with band aid solutions. My advocacy of purging the
republicans and re-admitting Sword stems from the desire to put the campign on the
footing stated above.

That is the only winning strategy for 2002.

We should work out a statement of purpose that goes something like this:

Opposse republicans everywhere. Opposse democrats independently where we
can win and support them where republicans are a threat. Work to end the
two party system and replace it with a multi-party system.

This should be fleshed out but it can work as a basis.

Message:

Two points,
first, Cliff is correct that the decision to expel sword took place in a steering
committee meeting.

Secondly, the vote was 8 to 5  to adopt the purpose that you list below. Out of the
eight, 3 were Tracy Ford's kids (who are how old? and have done what?) and on top of
those three, one was Ford himself and the other was Bright.

What's good for the goose is good for the gander. But, maybe we should admit that the
current attempts at democracy in the campaign leave something to be desired. And agree
to come up with a better framework.

Subject:Attacking Anarchist?
Message:

Joe,
Your flyer compares anarchists to the terrorists that attacked the WTC. That is not
only stupid it alienates everyone that you were working with. How can that be
productive? It is best to criticize people's actions not what they say. If the
anarchists do something that I think is wrong I will criticize it. Anarchists are
leading the "anti-globilization movement", they are fighting a significant aspect of
imperialism, to just dismiss that is arrogant and ignorant, if you think that only
local struggle is of importnace you are certainly not a Marxist, see Marx and Engels
on 1st International see Lenin What is to be done. see Ho Chi Min see Mao Zedong, see
Malcom X.
It was a mistake to compare anarchists with terrorists.
You have isolated yourself from the bulk of young organizers already. Persisting in
this way will only isolate you more, it has nothing to do with me. Though I will
continue to draw a line of demarcation between SWORD and Unity & Struggle. We have
many disagreements.
We are facing a very dangerous situation and there is certainly the potential that
Bush led Imperialism will push the world towards fascism. Your line is the same as the
Trots who attcked the Communists from within the United Front in Spain opening the way
for Franco. Before you deny it, try learning about it. Practice your line if you want.
Don't blame me for your failure isolation.

Keith

PS. This is the only response that I will make to  this point on e-mail. We don't have
time.

Can we get the complete list of songs. We should resist this immediately, it is a good
issue to organize youth around and if we don't resist, Bush will put us on the fascism

Subject:Re: [onepeoplesproject] NYT article on European response to Bush on WTC
Message:

Dave forwarded the New York Times article attached below. I responded to
this once off the top of my head, but I have been considering it more
and would like to add a few points. I think that it is very important
for us to build a anti-war united front and in that process unite
anti-imperialists and revolutionaries. So I make the points below in the
spirit of advancing our understanding of the world and hopefully our
ability to fight to transform it.

Dave has accussed Unity & Struggle of arguing that the bourgeoisie makes
history rather than the people. He basis this on two things. First,
becasue we have written that Imperialism is the principal aspect of the
contradiction between the people and imperialsim (meaning that at this
momnet in time Imperialsim has the upper hand on the people, this seems
obvious enough, Bush stole the presidency, they killed Kabila, Sharon is
prime minister in Israel etc. ). Second because we argued that Bush was
a serious threat and defeating him  was the main task of the people at
this time, in this place, under these conditions. Which to Dave menat
that we place our hopes in bourgeois politicians and the democratic
party; This is not true but we also realize that the people have been in
a retreat, probably since the death of Mao, but certainly after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, which if nothing else gave free reign to
US Imeprialism.
    In his e-mail below Dave exposes himself. It is he who believes that
the bourgeois make history (the European bourgeois of course). We should
not be mistaken, Bush is taking us to war, and we along with the people
of the world are the only ones who can stop it. The big bourgeois of
Europe will not stop him. Dave is also wrong in his belief that there is
no difference between Bush and Gore. While it is true that they both
belong to parties of Imperialism. And that the democrats are lining up
behind the new furer, It would also be true that the republicans would
line up behind Gore if he were president, but he would be moveing  in a
different direction.
     Bush and Gore represent different sections of the  big bourgois.
Gore/Clinton acted as policeman of the world, trying to unite  around
the international class of finance capitalists and their institutions
(the world bank, IMF, United Nations), representig the so-called "new
economy" (Al Gore caliming to have invented the internet!). The bombing
of Yugoslavia was carried by NATO, US troops under a Beligium commander.

    Bush, on the other hand,  does not even  know how to use a computer,
all he knows is oil. He doesn't want to police the world he wants to
bomb it, bomb it back to a Mad Max utopia where gasoline and oil replace
gold as the standard of exchange. He wants to establish US military
domination throughout the world. He is reviving the old imperialsit
revilaries (this is really what is being talked about in the article
that Dave forwarded  from the NYT)  that had subsided in the "united
front of Imperialists" aganist revolution, national liberation, and
socialism.
     What is ironic is that Dave is the one guilty of the very thing
that he accussed U&S of, which is believing that Imperialist rivalries
have ended and that Imperialsim no longer means War. They are coming we
better wake up. Bush stole the presidency but he had accomplices. At
this moment Schundler is calling for a police state. Bush's selection
set the precendent for the sugar coated fascistic discussion around
extending Guiliani's rule in New York City. It should be clear now that
Nadir's candidacy was a terrible mistake, that can not be repeated in
Jersey,  unless you need to watch them goose step through your
neighborhood to see what is happening. We must build a movment to
opposse the war, rising fascism (they are moving in this direction
rapidly) and to impeach Bush. Hitler's got a new face, and  round up is
already beginging, the already had a night of broken glass in
Paterson(the star ledger reported that it would be easy for a terrorist
to blend in with all the Arab immigrants who live there) . We can not
repeat the mistake of Weimar.

  A Pause to Ponder Washington's Tough Talk

  By SUZANNE DALEY

  [B]RUSSELS, Sept. 15  After offering expressions of support
     immediately following this week's attacks on the United States,
  European allies are showing signs of backpedaling.

  The NATO allies have said they could support some military action. But
  now the caveats are beginning to roll in, making clear that the terror
  attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon will not translate
  into an unconditional writ for American retaliation.

  Particularly as talk in Washington has grown tougher, the allies have
  begun showing signs that they want a carefully thought out plan to
  combat terrorism, not a burst of military might that turns out to be
  brutal and ineffective.

  Many politicians here have begun distancing themselves from Washington's
  saber rattling. While President Bush has repeatedly described the terror
  attacks as "acts of war," Europeans officials are going out of their way
  to avoid such language.

  On a radio program the Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, said the
  European Union was "on watch" and "mobilized." But he added, "We are not
  at war."

  In France, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has cautioned that there is no
  "war against Islam or the Arab- Muslim world." Moreover, he signaled
  that France would not automatically support military action. "Our
  humane, political and functional solidarity with the United States," he
  said, "does not deprive us of our sovereignty and freedom to make up our
  own minds."

  Even the French left, often thought of as reflexively anti-American
  seemed to soften. The daily Le Monde ran a column headlined "we are all
  Americans." But it is clear that the continent remains wary of a
  gung-ho, simplistic military retaliation, it sees America capable of.

  Since Wednesday, when the NATO alliance for the first time invoked its
  mutual defense clause, strongly suggesting it would offer military
  support if the United states should ask for it, European leaders have
  been stressing non-military options.

  On a visit to Russia Thursday, The French foreign minister, Hubert
  Vdrine, argued for a broad antiterrorism plan that might incorporate
  military action, but did not overlook financial and logistical networks
  as well as political efforts. The next day the German defense minister,
  Rudolph Scharping, also urged a "measured" response.

  Even Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has offered Mr. Bush his full
  support, insisted on Friday that any retaliation "must and will be based
  on hard evidence," and his spokesman has said that the support does not
  amount to a "blank check."

  The invocation of the mutual defense clause does not actually obligate
  NATO countries to do much. Any decision to launch joint strikes would
  require further council deliberation, as would a decision to place
  national forces under NATO command. For most, the real decision will
  come when America maps out its plans and asks for help.

  In the meantime, even Russia, which took the highly unusual step of
  issuing a joint statement with NATO, has made clear since then that the
  United States and its allies should not rely on Central Asia to stage
  any retaliatory strikes against Afghanistan.

  "I see absolutely no basis for even hypothetical suppositions about the
  possibility of NATO military operations on the territory of Central Asia
  nations," Mr. Ivanov said.

  Newspapers across the Continent are also urging the Americans to use
  restraint. The French daily Liberation called for "extreme severity
  against identifiable culprits" but cautioned against "blind vengeance."

  An editorial published today in The Guardian urged Mr. Bush to consider
  diplomatic coercion, painstaking investigation, interdiction of
  terrorist funds and economic punishment before "sending his enormous
  bombs."

  "There is another way," the newspaper said. "It is less dramatic, less
  visceral, more statesmanlike."

Subject:Re: [nbpc] abolish the family
Message:

Cliff,
I think that we should clearly oppose any attempts to coerce anyone economicly or
otherwise into marriage. On the other hand people have the right to be married if they
choose. You can't abolish the family from outside it. We are still fighting for
democrcay in the U.S. They have been attacking the family since the days of chattel
slavery and it is still going on along with the rest of slavery's legacy. Before we
can talk about "abolish the family" it has to be able to exist. (The destruction of
the projects in New Brunswick without any replacemnt housing destroyed countless
families). Just as we ultimately want to go beyond democracy to socilaism and
Communism, yet we realize that first we must get democracy, so to before we can
abolish the family it must be allowed to exist.
    Family is very much related to the struggle for democracy before the rise of
bourgeois democratic revolutions peasant families, serf families, slave families, were
devasted raped, exploited, torn apart. (the right of the first night, dramatized in
"Braveheart" and the horror of  rape during chattel slavery).
   We develop a program that demands children's right to get out of abusive
situations. We want women to be able to have the unchallenged right to divorce etc. We
must  fight for institutions that can provide services and resources that imperialism
puts on families. I think that the program certainly needs to be devloped and I think
that it is a significant aspect of women's emancipation and the democratic struggle.
But the slogan "abolish the family" is ultra-left.

  Americans Call for Military Response and Personal Sacrifice

          In a number of separate polls, more than 80 percent endorsed
the use of military force in response to last week's
  attacks.  Moreover, support for military actions remained strong even
if it required the use of ground troops (82 percent),
  thousands of American casualties (77 percent), the killing of innocent
civilians (68 percent), and even prolonged deployment
  over several years (66 percent).  Nonetheless, there is no rush to
judgment among the American public, as 81 percent say
  we should wait to be certain of those responsible before launching
attacks against Osama bin Laden or any other suspects.
  President Bush has repeatedly said America has been brought into a new
war, and more than two-thirds agree with him.  An
  excellent analysis released by ABC News this week demonstrates that,
since World War II, such overwhelming support for
  military action is not always easy to build but remains solid once it
is established.

          A smaller, but still sizable, majority support a prolonged war
against terrorism throughout the world rather than simply
  retaliation against those involved in last Tuesday's attacks (58 to 40
percent).  They seem to be under no illusions about how
  difficult this battle against terrorism will be - 65 percent are very
or somewhat worried that military action will produce further
  attacks in response -  but they believe it is essential to the
country's long-term safety.  They are nearly unanimous (89
  percent) in their agreement that a failure to respond militarily would
increase the likelihood of future attacks.

          Americans also know that a war against terrorism will come at
some price to them in their daily lives.  At this moment,
  with the wounds of last week's attacks still raw, they are willing to
pay almost any price in terms of their civil liberties.  Nearly
  3-in-4 (74 percent) in the New York Times poll and 61 percent in the
L.A. Times survey believe Americans will have to give
  up some of their personal freedoms in order to make the country safe
from terrorist attacks.  The liberties they indicate they
  would be willing to sacrifice or at least compromise include a wide
array of increased security and travel restrictions, metal
  detectors and ID checks in public buildings, and even random stops of
individuals matching the profile of suspected
  terrorists.  Americans draw the line, however, at random searches and
seizures, monitoring of personal communications
  (telephone, mail, or e-mail), and tracking of financial transactions.


  New Priorities In a New America

          The priorities of political leaders and voters have changed
dramatically in the past week.  President Bush proudly
  proclaimed his tax cut and education reform proposals as his top
priorities before the attacks, despite public disapproval of
  his tax cut and the inability of congressional leaders to reach
consensus on his already-weakened education package.  Now
  his relatively unpopular domestic agenda has been replaced by the new
war on terrorism, and the public approves of the shift
  in focus - 79 percent agree that fighting terrorism should be the
focus of Bush's administration, and 64 percent say it is the
  number one priority for Bush and the Congress to address.  The issues
which previously dominated voters' concerns - the
  economy (20 percent) and education (7 percent) - are still important
but have been placed in a new context after the terrorist
  attacks.

          Before the attacks, President Bush and Democrats in Congress
were locked in a fierce battle over the disappearance of
  our record surpluses, competing spending priorities, and how to avoid
dipping into the Social Security surplus while meeting
  the federal government's fiscal obligations.  Today, there is little
debate over spending from the Social Security surplus to
  fund disaster relief efforts and the military response.  However,
these new demands do not negate the fundamental questions
  that faced us before the attacks - in fact, they only multiply the
urgency.  How can the federal government meet its obligations
  in the areas of retirement security, education, and health care while
helping bail out the airline industry (67 percent favor),
  rebuilding the Pentagon and lower Manhattan, and supporting a renewed
commitment to "homeland security" and a new war
  on terrorism?  For 85 percent of Americans, rolling back the Bush tax
cut is at least part of the answer.  This overwhelming
  support for a rollback of the earlier tax cuts passed by Congress
directly refutes the push by some Republicans in Congress
  to cut capital gains taxes as part of an economic stimulus package.
Research has consistently shown us that, even in times of
  relative peace when our country is not nearly as united in purpose as
it is today, taxpayers will gladly pay their fair share as
  long as they feel their money is being well spent by the government.
With the priorities so clear and the need so great, there
  is little doubt that Americans are more than willing to do their part
to help our country meet these challenges.

  NBC News/Wall Street Journal - 9/16
  Please tell me which ONE you feel is the most important priority for
the President and Congress to address this year.

  Fighting terrorism      64
  Strengthening the economy       20
  Reforming the education system  7
  Dealing with health care costs  6
  Not sure        3


  Do you favor or oppose the United States' spending money on a military
response to terrorism even if it means rolling back
  some of the tax cuts that Congress passed this year?

  Favor   85
  Oppose  10
  Not sure        5

 Foreign Press Reveals Collin Powel Negotiated Afghanistan War Months
 Before Suicide Air Attacks:  Motive is Oil Profits for Multinational
War
 Partners

 The BBC and an Indian news agency in seperate stories, one months
before
 and one shortly after the suicide air attack on America, have presented

 the most horrendous picture to date regarding the true nature of the
 terror in NYC and elsewhere:  Prior knowledge.

 Those backing President Bush's request for a coalition had better make
 certain they are getting their fair share of the spoils of war, a war
 arranged months before the suicide air attacks against the US.  A pact
 for war against the Taliban was made between the United States, CIS
 (Russia), Pakistan, and India to facilitate a Middle-East to S.E. Asia
 Oil Pipeline, which cannot take place with growing political and
 religious upheaval in the region at the hands of the Taliban.  Iran is
 thought to be a covert member to the pact. The combat was initially
 slated for mid October, which would seem to account for warnings that
 preparing for war will take time.

 The problem is that the ONLY logical pipeline route runs for nearly a
 thousand miles along the Afghanistan border with Iran and Pakistan,
 (largely so close as to be visible from the border. This route would
 seem to provide the US with the best incentive to date to cooperate
with
 Iran by, in essence, competing with a Chinese backed oil pipeline
 project serving the same oil fields in northern Iran and points south,
 preventing China from obtaining a defacto monopoly holder on oil
 supplies for SE Asia. The Chinese began negotiating that project in
 1997, causing a great deal of consternation for the Clinton
 administration and major US oil companies who stood to gain little in
 the project.

 However, the Taliban are fomenting both religious and political
 instability in the region between Iranian and Pakistani Shiites and
 Taliban Sunni Islamic sects, with notable success. This unrest makes
 impractical the financial investment and international cooperation
 required to construct the pipeline.

 The solution was apparantly to be death warrants for both the Taliban
 leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, and capitalistic terrorist Osama bin
Laden,
 who had apparantly grown too profitable and too strong for his former
 CIA masters to control. Destruction of the Taliban was imperative, but
 political needs would not permit a simple solution.

 For Pakistan and India, long bitter rivals, to partner would require
 only sufficient profits to make peace between them more palatable.
 However, Pakistan required a significant motive beyond profits to risk
 internal conflict due to its nation's divided religious and political
 landscape, all intertwined with allegiances to the Taliban.  There
 needed to be an extremely irresistible reason for the nation's
 leadership to back/support military action against what their own
 citizens considered a virtual spiritual ally.

 In like manner, Iran required an irresistible reason to publicly
support
 with vocal blessings American interests in any such action, and at the
 same time, needed a way to salve bitter wounds between the two
countries
 which would allow future joint financial ventures.

 In similar manner, the United States needed a very powerful and
 irresistible reason to mobilize America into supporting such a war, a
 war which would be extremely difficult to prosecute, as the Soviet
Union
 could testify of first hand, having found the Soviet-Afghanistan war to

 be their 'Vietnam.'

 The logical solution which would indeed provide irresistible reasons
for
 all concerned, would now seem to be the horrific terror campaign
against
 the NYC and Washington DC by former CIA strong man, Osama bin Laden,
who
 perhaps is still on the payroll after all.

 Seperately, it seems, one of the terrorists was seen by Mossad agents
to
 have consulted with Iraqi intelligence operatives prior to the attack,
a
 matter passed to CIA as a warning that perhaps Iraq and Afghanistan
were
 partnering.  US Intelligence confirms this event but claims it was not
 because the terrorism was sponsored by Iraq, a matter not evident to
 Mossad, yet CIA seems to know.  Indeed, the conference was likely for
 the personal sale of information regarding the truth of the coming
 attack, which in part accounts for Iraq's somewhat even handed
 statements on the dissaster, as well as those of Libya.  Both nations
 would now seem to be jointly blackmailing US intelligence for a slice
of
 the action and continued safety - in exchange for kind words and a
 hands-off policy towards the looming military action.  .

 The attack comes in the wake of revelations by author James Bamford in
 his book Body of Evidence of a secret plan for US military intelligence

 operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American targets... blow

 up buildings, shoot down civilian airliners, blow up American war
ships,
 and assassinate American citizens... for political gain.  Operation
 Northwoods was signed off by all five Joint Chiefs of Staff under the
 Kennedy administration as a way to foment public support for a war
 against Cuba, who would be blamed for the terrorist acts.  Rejected
 sternly by President Kennedy, which may have contributed to reasons
 behind his assassination, this Reichtag fire approach to political gain

 may have been the model for September 11, shifting the blame this time
 to the Taliban homeland. What would make a more irresistible excuse for

 war?

 In light of these revelations, American media needs to decide if it
will
 continue to ignore truth and the principles of journalism for its
 preferred role as Fourth Estate PR spokesperson of government. Will
they
 tell America these facts or hide what the rest of the world already
 knows through news agencies which have no such loyalties?

 Will American politicians find themselves being asked by their
 constituents if they knew in advance of this death pact, and have the
 blood of innocents on their hands as coconspirators, or will they
demand
 a full accounting of the facts before signing off on the blood lust
 boiling over as result of this war plot?

 For more information, please review the following news sources:

 The first is a BBC story of a former Pakistani diplomat coming forward
 to tell of his country's knowledge of the planned war, concerned
perhaps
 that the air attacks were not as advertised. Find it at:

 <http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1550000/1550366.stm>

 The above article confirms the second, which was written by an Indian
 news agency months before the attack and is much more detailed:

 <http://www.indiareacts.com/Story33.htm>

 H. Michael Sweeney is a published author in the area of personal
privacy
 and safety, and an expert on disinformation and an investigative writer

 specializing in crimes of the intelligence community. Mr. Sweeney is
one
 of many persons preparing to educate America of the existence of these
 facts.

 "America will undoubtedly have its unstoppable war thanks to the Fourth

 Estate, but at what price?" asks Mr. Sweeney.  "Only those powerful men

 who know the truth will profit, and every American will have paid for
it
 with their souls, others with their blood."  He adds that "It is
 extremely ironic that this plan comes so close on the heels of the
 release of the James Bond film, The World is Not Enough, which
parallels
 many of the key elements of the underlying story."

I think that it was Kruschev whoannounced "we will crush you". By this he meant that
the Soviet Union will produce more stuff than the capitalists. His mistake was not
that he was wrong about that; his mistake was that he believed that building socialism
was essentially the same as building capitalism. That is socialism achieved through
production.
This is the essence of your line "we get out more than you" (which is a fact only in
your mind); it was the same point made earlier, "I register more voters".
You don't get out as many papers as the NY Times and you don't register as many voters
as the republicans or the democrats.
So if your measure of correctness is based on numbers of papers handed out and voters
registered than the bourgeois are better revolutionaries than you.

This line has been talked about quite a bit recently. It is economism. That is the
belief that production equals transformation. The line that the Soviet Union would
"build socialism" through industrialization. Leninism developed in the struggle
against economism, if you are interested you might read Class Struggles in the USSR
volume 1 by Charlie Bettleheim. (they got it at Alexander Libary). He does a very
thorough exposure of the line taht you are advocating.
I hope that you can find time to read it, it would be nice to base our practice and
discussion on revolutionary theory rather than empricist opinions. If we are truly
interested in self-criticism we might try to consider the effect of "american common
sense" on our thinking. The essence of which is american pragmatism. Which is the
theory that is practiced widely in New Brunswick.

I think that you are quoting Mao. You might want to read that essay. Speaking of
doctrinaires and lazybones.
Mao is speaking of people who refuse to study and prefer repeating slogans over and
over.
However,  Lenin did say without revolutionary theory there is no revolutionary
movemnt. Which is precisely the problem that we are facing. We have productionists on
our left and on our right, both sides refuse to deal in any serious way with
revolutionary theory. Both our rightists and our "leftists" refuse to unite. on the
left we get "stick your apology, but unite and "fuck you, unite" and on the right "we
have to distance ourselves".  It is making me sick. We are facing the rise of fascism
and world war 3. If you tell people "fuck you" (or compare them to people who have
just commited atrocities) expect them not to unite with you. If Mao and Lenin haven't
made that clear that's because they probably expected you to learn that in
kindergarden.(By the way Lenin criticized anarchism but he also went out of his way to
organize with anarchists and to get them involved in the activity of the Soviet
Governement).
   I suspect that your comment "lazybones" is meant to be a critique of "U&S
invisibility". I would have liked the paper to be there, in fact we went to Brower
commons, and were there alone. We have limited resources and limited time. If you
think that is lazy, who cares.We are not selling girl scout cookies for merit badges.
I certainly think that there is laziness on yr end, that is a refusal to deal in any
serious way with revolutionary  theory and facts, replacing it with opinion and
speculations. If you believe that Marxism is a scienec then you should study it like
one. The living soul of marxism is the concrete analysis of concret conditions.

I am not against working with h-fraud against the war, however it is certainly
suspicious that no one wants to "distance themselves" from him. His boycott
elections/nader line may be more congenial. Nonetheless, ignoring lessons from
kindergarten doesn't help. A good organizer is not someone who hands out the most
papers or registers the most voters, a good organizer is someone who can unite people
around a revolutionary political line. You can sell a million cookies but still your
activity has done more to dis-unite (or at least give enough pre-texts to make
splitting easy) than uniting.

If you are intersted in haveing a discussion around these things, I will be happy to
respond. If you are just going to keep on defending your activity without any thought
of self-criticism or serious study then I would prefer not to waste anymore time.

Flavio,
I think taht the recent events have made it clear enough that while "all politics is
local" that doesn't mean that international and national events and issues are not
played out locally. All politics is local means that everything that is
"international" is local to social groups who are taking part, it only becomes
international if we here about it. I think that issues local to New Brunswick still
need to be adresssed, at the same tiome the a\whole world is rapidly changing and we
are certainly on teh precipe of disaster, fascism and world war. There is talk of
appointing Guilainai to another term in NYC, Racial profiling is now being hailed as a
correct response, vigilantism is running rampid. Now is not teh time to stick our
heads in the sand. The exclusion of international and natioanl politics in teh
People's campaign last effort is now proving to have been a serious dis-service to the
people who wer were trying to organize, to people who we might have given soem of teh
ideological tools to understand what is happening in the world. We didn't do that.
That was a very serious mistake. It is too bad that the campaign could not realize
this and was allowed to nearly dis-intergrate by the refusal to be self-critical.

Message:

This is an article from the Wall St Journal, explaining the Bush and bin
Landen family connection. The end of the article is clipped but it
reveals connections with Jimmy Carter and Texas oil and binLanden's.
This article is a pretty deep exposure especially considering it is a
bourgeois source. I think that it can be read as a warning to Bush Jr.
One of the main contradictions functioning in this crisis is between
International Imperialist finace capital which is operating under the
banner of "Globolization", and U.S. based Imperialism. This
contradiction was represented clearly in the past presidential election
between Gore ("I invented the internet"/ "New Economy", "Globilization"/
NATO, United Nations etc.) and Bush ("old economy" oil, unilateral
"America first" etc). This contradiction is also playing out within
Bush's administartion with Collin Powell representing the interests of
International Cpaital. Bush wants to establish a US military
dictatorship over the world. This is what is meant by "US led coalition
against terrorism". Powell is trying to  build coalition and work within
NATO. Bush is pushing in the dircetion of world war which would be good
for the Oil Industry, since oil  will be obsolete soon if technology
continues to advance and is allowed to be utilized. The foreign minister
of Iran spoke on Charlie Rose tonight and sd that Iran would join a
United Nations coalition against terrorism but they would not join a US
led coalition.  A UN action would probably end up looking like a
Clintonian bombing campign with the death of bin Landen as the goal. A
US led action will have as its goal militarty occupation of the middle
east and could potentailly draw in other imperialist powers, and other
countries against the US.
We need to opposse both the Jihad and the Crusade and raise the banner
of anti-imperialism and revolutionary democracy. Impeaching Bush would
be a first step.
The article below provides a lot of info that could be further
researched.

Bin Landen Family tied to U.S. Group

If US boosts defense spending in its quest to stop bin Landen's alleged
terrorist activities, there may be one unexpected beneficiary: Mr. bin
Landen's family.
Among its far flung business interest, the well-heeled Saudi Arabian
clan-which says it is estranged from Osama- is an investor in a fund
established by Carlyle Group, a well connected Washington merchant bank
specializing in buyouts of defense and aerospace companies.
      Through this investment and its ties to Saudi royalty, the bin
Landen family has become aquatinted with some of the biggest names in
the Republican Party. In recent years, former President Bush,
ex-secretary of Sate James Baker and ex-Secretary of Defense Frank
Carlucci have made the pilgrimage to the bin Landen family headquarters
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bush makes speeches on behalf of Carlyle
group and is senior adviser to its Asian Partners fund, while Mr. Baker
is its senior counselor. Mr. Carlucci is the group's Chairman.
    Osama is one of 50 children of Mahammed bin Landen, who built the
family's $5 billion dollar business, Saudi Binlanden Group, largely with
construction contracts from the Saudi government. Osama worked briefly
in the business and is believed to have inherited as much as $50 million
from his father in cash and stock, although he doesn't have access to
the shares, a family spokesman says. Because Mr. bin Landen 's
citizenship was revoked in 1994, Mr. bin Landen is ineligible to own
assets in the Kingdom, the spokesman added.
   The bin Landen family has long disowned Osama, and has co-operated
fully with several federal investigations into his activities. The
family business, headed by Osama's half-brother Bakr, epitomizes the
US-Saudi alliance that the suspected terrorists often rails against.
After 1996 truck bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 US
servicemen, Saudi Binlanden group built military barracks and airfields
for US troops.
    People familiar with the family's finances say the bin Landen's do
much of their banking with National Commercial Bank in Saudi Arabia and
with the London branch of Deutsche Bank AG. They also use Citigroup Inc.
and ABN Amro, the people said.
    "If there were ever any company closely connected to the US and its
presence in Saudi Arabia its the Saudi Binlanden Group," says Charles
Freeman of the Middle East Policy Council, a Washington nonprofit
concern that receives tens of thousands a year from the bin Landen
family. "They're the establishment that Osama is trying to overthrow".
     Mr. Freeman, who served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia during
the Gulf War, says he has spoken to two of Osama's brothers since the
WTC attack. They told him, he says, that the FBI has been "remarkably
sensitive", tactful, and protective" of the family during the current
crisis, recognizing its longstanding friendship with the U.S....
    A US inquiry into bin Landen family business dealings could brush
against some big names associated with the US government. Former
President Bush said through his chief of staff, Jean Becker, that he
recalled only one meeting with the bin Laden family, which took place in
Nov. 1998. Ms. Becker confirmed that there was a second meeting in Jan.
2000, after being read the ex-Presidents subsequent thank you note.
"President Bush does not have a relationship with the bin Landen family"
says Ms. Becker. "He's met them twice"....
