Today (Jan. 6th, 2012) is Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Oscar Lopez Rivera's 69th birthday! For 30 years, he has spent his birthdays seperated from his family, friends and community because he dared to challenge the U.S. colonization of his homeland Puerto Rico; a colony of the United States since 1898!¬† 
¬†
He, along with Avelino and Norberto Gonzalez Claudio, are our three heroes behind the walls; they are the Puerto Rican Three Kings of Liberation, Freedom and Revolution.¬† They were taken from us¬†by the same imperialist¬†government that exploits poor working people throughout the world.¬†
¬†
We cannot sit idly by and let this injustice continue!
¬†
The PEOPLE have the power to free political prisoners; now more than even Oscar, Avelino, Norberto, Mumia, Leonard Peltier, the Cuban 5,¬†and the over 200 U.S. held political prisoners need our support and action!¬† We need people to join us¬†in the streets, schools, churches, colleges, and unions and help us demand their freedom!¬† We need people to get creative and active!¬†¬†Organize a workshop, a lettering writing night or presentation at your church, school, or youth group!¬†All your ideas are welcome!¬†
¬†
If you are interested in volunteering contact us at: ProLibertad@...
¬†
Also, we need financial support to make our work a reality!¬† We need NEW flyers, posters, brochures and banners for our work in 2012!¬† The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling on all our supporters and allies to help us make freedom happen!

Due to the U.S. government‚Äôs denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!!

Subject:Urgent Action: Daily News Attacks Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Oscar Lopez Rivera
Message:

URGENT ACTION: Daily News launches Political Attack On Oscar Lopez Rivera!
¬†
On Saturday January 21st, the Daily News published an article by Mara Bovsun titled,¬† ‚ÄúJustice Story: FALN bomb kills 4 at Fraunces Tavern,¬†where George Washington said farewell to troops‚Äù[1] in which she details the history of the armed action organized by the FALN at Fraunces Tavern on January 24th, 1975.
¬†
At the end of the article, she mentions that Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Oscar Lopez Rivera, who was a member of the FALN, was denied parole last year and quoted John Connor, the son of one of the Fraunces Tavern victims, ‚ÄòFinally‚Ä¶some justice forour father, Frank Connor, and other victims of the FALN.‚Äù‚Äô
¬†
This article is a one-sided hit piece that attempts to portray Oscar as a terrorist who is getting his ‚Äújust deserts.‚Äù¬† The Daily News must be held accountable for reporting the facts of Oscar‚Äôs case.
¬†
For example: In a highly unorthodox and
 controversial move, John Connor and other family members of the Fraunces Tavern bombing were allowed to give testimony at Oscar‚Äôs parole hearing to prejudice the parole board. Oscar‚Äôs defense team protested their attendance and asked for them to leave; there request was denied.
¬†
Oscar was never charged with or convicted of the Fraunces Tavern action, therefore can‚Äôt be held responsible for it; their testimonials against him should not have had any bearing on his parole hearing and should not have been allowed.
¬†
While incarcerated, Oscar‚Äôs behavior has been exemplary and support for his parole has come from religious leaders, academics, union leaders and elected officials throughout Puerto Rico and the United States.¬† In fact, thousands of letters, telephone calls and emails have been made and continue today calling for Oscar‚Äôs release.
¬†
The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is asking our supporters to call the Daily News‚Äô News Department and demand that an article be published on the international movement for Oscar Lopez Rivera‚Äôs parole!¬† Demand that the News Department speak with Oscar Lopez Rivera‚Äôs legal representatives, his supporters and family members!¬† Demand a stop to this yellow journalism and fairness in the news reporting!
¬†
Call the Daily News 212-210-1585 and ask for the News Department! Let them know ProLibertad is available for any interviews on Oscar at 718-601-4751 or ProLibertad@...

In the mostly Orwellian "1984" newspeaking, lying, world, the following lies are also significant:
In USA, the world's largest economy, economical plutarchy, i.e. capitalism, is falsely called economic freedom! 
In China, the country with most people in the world, a totalitarian oligarchy is falsely called the people's democracy! 
And there are much more Orwellian "1984" newspeak type lies in the world - many of these lies are revealed and unmasked at www.anarchy.no!
Be enlightened and prepared for real democracy, i.e. anarchy, feel free to study all at www.anarchy.no!

The truth: the only Anarchies, i.e. anarchist countries in the world, are Norway, The Swiss Confederation and Iceland, 
and they are only anarchies of rather low degree...

And, say, Somalia, as the newspeaking lie-machines CNN, BBC, Foxnews, Reuters, Associated Press, Wikipedia and most of Internet in general, etc. 
falsely call 'anarchy' is in reality an ochlarchy with rivaling polyarchy, i.e. chaos - not anarchy, and the country most far from anarchy in the world! 
In general, x-archy, where x can be anything but not 'an', is the opposite of freedom and real democracy. 

www.anarchy.no has practically certain truths and likely truths, i.e. real scientific non-rejected hypothesis!
Most of so called social sciences and newsmedia represent false ideology, propaganda, manufactured consent, lies and more lies!

Subject:Response to the Daily News Attack against Oscar Lopez Rivera
Message:

A Response to the New York Daily News
Perpetuating False Charges on the 1975 Fraunces Tavern Bombing

¬†
By Jan Susler (January 26, 2012)
http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?llr=hlnfsnbab&v=001vd12ggE3Xa5vYwDEWfeyATO7XReN7sXEto32Bdxm0ueRIJ0KGqbYYoN7QrFSVmblEbSDvKhwrGT2gWYMchca_7HVeAOPPSij-jtLAYNE-fHeHr_oNr6ijQ%3D%3D


Oscar L√≥pez Rivera, a 69-year-old decorated Vietnam veteran, has spent 31 years in U.S. prison for his commitment to the independence of Puerto Rico. He has the dubious distinction of being the longest held pro-independence prisoner in Puerto Rico's history of seeking self-determination - and thousands preceded him. Convicted of seditious conspiracy in Chicago, he is serving a sentence of 70 years, although he was not convicted of harming or killing anyone. 

If you read the New York Daily News article published this year on January 24th, on the 37th anniversary of the bombing of Fraunces Tavern, you wouldn't know this . . . and you would be left with the impression that L√≥pez Rivera should remain in prison because he is somehow responsible for that tragic action. That is, sadly, what the FBI has led the victims to believe, and it is most certainly the weapon wielded by the FBI in its unceasing efforts to convince the public, the U.S. Parole Commission, and the President, that L√≥pez Rivera should remain in prison. 

L√≥pez Rivera has denied participation in the 1975 tragedy at Fraunces Tavern. There is no evidence to connect him to it. If the FBI had such evidence, it would surely prosecute him - but in the 37 years since, it has not. Instead, it has waged a campaign of guilt by association, using its bully pulpit to prolong his imprisonment, and thereby punish him for his commitment to the independence of Puerto Rico. 
In fact, during his 1981 trial for seditious conspiracy, L√≥pez Rivera presented no defense in court. Prosecutors risked little, if anything, in charging him on this case. They did not charge him - again, because there simply is not a shred of evidence that could even remotely link him to the Fraunces Tavern event. The New York Daily News has done its readers - and more importantly, truth and justice - a great disservice by implying there is somehow some kind of link between L√≥pez Rivera and this case, a link that somehow has mysteriously eluded prosecutors, the courts and the FBI for more than 31 years.
A campaign for the release of L√≥pez Rivera and his co-defendants, which enjoyed broad support throughout Puerto Rican civil society and among the international human rights and faith community, resulted in President Clinton's 1999 offer to commute the sentences of most of them. Most were offered immediate release, but L√≥pez Rivera would have to serve an additional 10 years behind bars. The others accepted the president's offer, were welcomed as returning heroes in Puerto Rico and Puerto Rican communities in the U.S., and for the past 12 years have lived productive, law-abiding lives. Out of concern that the President's offer did not include all those in prison for their commitment to independence , L√≥pez Rivera rejected the offer. Had he accepted, he would have been released in September of 2009. Those excluded from the president's offer have since been released - L√≥pez Rivera is now the only one still in prison from the Chicago seditious conspiracy
 cases of the 1980s.

That campaign continues to advocate for L√≥pez Rivera's release from prison. Recent activities in Puerto Rico include mass demonstrations during President Obama's June visit to the Island, calling for his release - and elected officials personally asking the President to release him - ; on the occasion of L√≥pez Rivera's 69th birthday, the Catholic Archbishop presiding over a mass, and a gathering of representatives from every sector of civil society calling for his release; and students painting murals featuring his face and the message "Freedom Now!" for L√≥pez Rivera.

In the proud United States tradition of exercising the constitutional power of pardon, three U.S. Presidents have commuted the sentences of Puerto Rican political prisoners: President Truman in 1952, President Carter in 1979, and President Clinton in 1999. President Obama should not be fooled by the FBI's campaign of untruths. 

For more information about the campaign for Oscar Lopez Rivera's release, contact the National Boricua Human Rights Network at www.boricuahumanrights.org.

Jan Susler, a partner at the People's Law Office in Chicago and member of the National Lawyers Guild, has been working as attorney for the Puerto Rican political prisoners for the past 30 years, and was lead counsel in the campaign leading to the 1999 presidential commutation. She continues to work with those who remain in prison. She can be reached at 773-235-0070 x 118 and jsusler@.... 

URGENT ACTION: Daily News launches Political Attack On Oscar Lopez Rivera!


On Saturday January 21st, the Daily News published an article by Mara Bovsun titled,¬† ‚ÄúJustice Story: FALN bomb kills 4 at Fraunces Tavern,¬†where George Washington said farewell to troops‚Äù[1] in which she details the history of the armed action organized by the FALN at Fraunces Tavern on January 24th, 1975.
¬†
At the end of the article, she mentions that Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Oscar Lopez Rivera, who was a member of the FALN, was denied parole last year and quoted John Connor, the son of one of the Fraunces Tavern victims, ‚ÄòFinally‚Ä¶some justice forour father, Frank Connor, and other victims of the FALN.‚Äù‚Äô
¬†
This article is a one-sided hit piece that attempts to portray Oscar as a terrorist who is getting his ‚Äújust deserts.‚Äù¬† The Daily News must be held accountable for reporting the facts of Oscar‚Äôs case.
¬†
For example: In a highly unorthodox and controversial move, John Connor and other family members of the Fraunces Tavern bombing were allowed to give testimony at Oscar‚Äôs parole hearing to prejudice the parole board. Oscar‚Äôs defense team protested their attendance and asked for them to leave; there request was denied.
¬†
Oscar was never charged with or convicted of the Fraunces Tavern action, therefore can‚Äôt be held responsible for it; their testimonials against him should not have had any bearing on his parole hearing and should not have been allowed.
¬†
While incarcerated, Oscar‚Äôs behavior has been exemplary and support for his parole has come from religious leaders, academics, union leaders and elected officials throughout Puerto Rico and the United States.¬† In fact, thousands of letters, telephone calls and emails have been made and continue today calling for Oscar‚Äôs release.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is asking our supporters to call the Daily News‚Äô News Department and demand that an article be published on the international movement for Oscar Lopez Rivera‚Äôs parole!¬† Demand that the News Department speak with Oscar Lopez Rivera‚Äôs legal representatives, his supporters and family members!¬† Demand a stop to this yellow journalism and fairness in the news reporting!

Call the Daily News 212-210-1585 and ask for the News Department! Let them know ProLibertad is available for any interviews on Oscar at 718-601-4751 or ProLibertad@...

The Committee to Honor Puerto Rican Women on International Working Women‚Äôs Day
Honoring Alice Cardona (posthumously), Yolanda Sanchez and Melinda Gonzalez

The Committee to Honor Puerto Rican Women on International Working Women‚Äôs Day, once again will host their annual event Celebrating Puerto Rican Woman: Today, Tomorrow and Always, at Casabe Houses at 150 East 121st Street on March 10th from 4-8pm.¬†

This year the Committee will honor the late Alice Cardona (1930-2011) for her enduring advocacy for women‚Äôs rights and bilingual education as well as her founding of various Latina organizations. Yolanda Sanchez will be honored for her fervent defense of Puerto Rican empowerment in New York City as well as her work in foster care, housing, with youth and, the aging.¬† Melinda Gonzalez will be honored for her steadfast commitment to bring the Afro-Puerto Rican art form of Bomba and leadership development to young people and audiences throughout NYC. 

The three honorees will receive the ‚ÄúAdelfa Vera Award‚Äù recognizing the late Dona Vera‚Äôs commitment to awaken the Puerto Rican people to a future of freedom and social justice.

A day we reaffirm women‚Äôs place of honour at the head of our families, communities and movements.¬† More than anything else, it is a day that all workers, whatever their gender, colour, or creed, remind those who seek to divide us that we know that our struggle, our enemy, and our goal, is one and the same.

Radio Cuban 5 Online is Born!

Also:
LETTER WRITING CAMPAIGN FOR THE CUBAN 5!


Due to the U.S. government‚Äôs denial to 
approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not 
seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen 
their parents, wives and children with regularity. The U.S. government has taken 
prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. 



The U.S. government‚Äôs denial of visitation rights is a cruel 
and horrible form of 
psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; 
none of these family members are a threat to national security. 


We are asking people to fax or mail out this 
letter to Ms. Navanetham Pillay, The NEW High Commissioner of Human Rights of 
the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. We are asking her 
to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5‚Äôs mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. 
government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!¬†

LETTER TO THE HIGH COMMISSIONER

Rights

URGENT Action for the Cuban 5
Roberto Gonz·lez, RenÈ's brother, 
is gravely ill.
Tell President Obama: Let RenÈ visit Roberto!
NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO FREE 
THE CUBAN FIVE
ComitÈ Nacional por 
la Libertad de los Cinco Cubanos

 
Roberto Gonz·lez, RenÈ's only sibling and an important member of the 
Cuban Five's legal team, is gravely ill with cancer in a Havana 
hospital. As Cuban Five supporters know, although RenÈ has served his 
unjust sentence of more than 13 years in U.S. prison, as a punitive measure he 
is being forced to serve probation in the United States. As a result he is 
unable to be with his brother at this critical time, unless he receives special 
permission to do so.

His attorney Phil Horowitz has filed an emergency 
court petition requesting permission for RenÈ to return to Cuba for only two 
weeks to visit his brother in the hospital. The petition states, "Over the past 
nearly five months since his release from incarceration, the defendant has 
faithfully complied with each and every condition of his supervised release." 
Horowitz tells the National Committee, "The motion that is being filed is not 
unusual; it is common for a defendant to seek court permission on an emergency 
basis, to travel internationally for health concerns of a family member."

RenÈ, as well as the other four, should be allowed 
to return to Cuba immediately and permanently. However, in this emergency we ask 
you tocontact President Obama and urge him to immediately allow RenÈ to 
return to Cuba for two weeks as a humanitarian gesture.

Please use the form below to send an email 
to Obama. You can also call the White House at 202-456-1111 to make the 
same request. Please act now!

Now more than ever we must let High Comissioner Pillay know that Adriana has the support of the masses!¬† Download the Project's letter and mail it or fax it to her!¬† Let us add our voices to Adriana's so that the wives/families of the Cuban 5 can receive their visas.
¬†
Due to the U.S. government‚Äôs denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity. The U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. 
¬†
The U.S. government‚Äôs denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security. 
¬†
We are asking people to fax or mail out this letter to Ms. Navanetham Pillay, The NEW High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5‚Äôs mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!

Geneva: High Commissioner meets with Gerardo's wifeMar. 5, 2012
Reprinted from Prensa Latina 
Geneva, March 5 - The High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, Navy Pillay, today received Adriana P√©rez, wife of Gerardo, one of the Cuban Five anti-terrorists, unjustly imprisoned in the United States.
In the meeting, Adriana mentioned the suffering that almost 14 years of prison have represented for the Five and their families, to live separated for so much time and with limitations of all kinds.
¬†
The wife of Gerardo spoke to the High Commissioner of the need for that organization to intercede directly in favor of the motion solicited by Ren√© Gonz√°lez's attorney, for permission to travel to Cuba to visit his brother, who is gravely ill. She also conveyed the desire of reunification of the elderly mothers of the Five who are still alive.
¬†Geneva, Mar 6 (Prensa Latina) Adriana Perez, the wife of one of the five anti-terrorist Cuban fighters unfairly held in the United States, on Tuesday denounced before the UN Human Rights Council the illegalities committed in this case.
¬†
In an intensive dialogue with the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Perez recalled that the Group already declared itself against the imprisonment of Antonio Guerrero, Fernando Gonzalez, Ramon Labanino, Rene Gonzalez and Gerardo Hernandez.
¬† 
Although almost seven years have passed since the Working Group ruled arbitrary the imprisonment of The Cuban Five, the US government has yet to comply with it, said the wife of Gerardo, whose visa applicationhas been repeatedly refused by Washington.
¬†
"I would like this to be the last time I let my voice be heard in this plenary to denounce the violations committed against our relatives and demand their return home," she said.
¬†
Fourteen years would have gone by since the start of an unfair, painful proceeding, lacking the least credibility in the US judicial system.
Adriana Perez referred to the situation of Rene Gonzalez, who has been forced to remain in US territory, with great risk for his life, subject to an absurd supervised release regime, despite having served his sentence.
¬†
She denounced before the UN Human Rights Council that Rene has been denied temporary permission to visit his brother, seriously ill in Havana.
US President Barack Obama, a Nobel Peace Prizelaureate, has in his hands the release of these five Cubans who have sacrificed the best of their youth for the noble cause of defending life, she added.
¬†
She said that a lack of political will and ethics prevents today the Obama Administration from making a humanitarian gesture to put an end to such sorrow, ignoring the demands made by numerous organizations and notables worldwide who have declared themselves for the release of The Cuban Five.
"They are hostages of an absurd, absolutely anachronistic policy applied for over fifty years against our country," she denounced.
¬†
Also today, Adriana Perez was received by Gabriela Guzman, Assistant to the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, to whom she explained how this injustice is affecting directly The Cuban Five's mothers, wives, children and other relatives.
¬†
Adriana demanded that, in line with her mandate and based on elements of the case, the Rapporteur urge the US government to give a final solution on the granting of visas unconditionally, without any restriction.
¬†
She reaffirmed before the UN body the need to intercede with the US government so that Rene is allowed to travel to Cuba temporarily to visit his brother.

Manifeste AnarchofÈministe 

Anarchafeminist Manifesto 
Translated from French (Bulletin C.R.I.F.A. No 44 mars -avril 1983 p. 12, and Le Monde Libertaire, no 479 - 1983 p. 9 )

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All over the world most women have no rights whatsoever to decide upon important matters which concern their lives. Women suffer from oppressions of two kinds: 1) the general social oppression of the people, and 2) secondly sexism - oppression and discrimination because of their sex. 

There are five main forms of oppression: 

- Ideological oppression, brainwash by certain cultural traditions, religion, advertising and propaganda. Manipulation with concepts and play upon women's feelings and susceptibilities. Widespread patriarchal and authoritarian attitudes and capitalistic mentality in all areas. 

- State oppression, hierarchical forms of organization with command lines downwards from the top in most interpersonal relations, also in the so-called private life . 

- Economic exploitation and repression, as a consumer and a worker in the home and in low-salary women's jobs . 

- Violence, under the auspices of the society as well as in the private sphere - indirectly when there is coercion because of lack of alternatives and direct physical violence. 

- Lack of organization, tyranny of the structurelessness which pulverizes responsibility and creates weakness and inactivity. 

These factors work together and contribute simultaneously to sustain each other in a vicious circle. There is no panacea to break the circle, but it isn't unbreakable. 

Anarcha-feminism is a matter of consciousness. The consciousness which puts guardians off work. The principles of a liberating society thus stand perfectly clear to us. 

Anarcha-feminism means women's independence and freedom on an equal footing with men. A social organization and a social life where no-one is superior or inferior to anyone and everybody is coordinate, women as well as men. This goes for all levels of social life, also the private sphere.

Anarcha-feminism implies that women themselves decide and take care of their own matters, individually in personal matters, and together with other women in matters which concern several women. In matters which concern both sexes essentially and concretely women and men shall decide on an equal footing.

Women must have self-decision over their own bodies, and all matters concerning contraception and childbirth are to be decided upon by women themselves.

It must be fought both individually and collectively against male domination, attitudes of ownership and control over women, against repressive laws and for women's economic and social autonomy and independence. 

Crisis centers, day care centers, study and discussion groups, women's culture activities etc. must be established, and be run under womens's own direction. 

The traditional patriarchal nuclear family should be replaced by free associations between men and women based on equal right to decide for both parts and with respect for the individual person's autonomy and integrity. 

Sex-stereotyping in education, media and at the place of work must be abolished. Radical sharing of the work by the sexes in ordinary jobs, domestic life and education is a suitable mean. 

The structure of working life must be radically changed, with more part-time work and flat organized cooperation at home as well as in society. The difference between men's work and women's work must be abolished. Nursing and taking care of the children must concern men just as much as women. 

Female power and female prime ministers will neither lead the majority of women to their ends nor abolish oppression. Marxist and bourgeoisie feminists are misleading the fight for women's liberation. For most women it is not going to be any feminism without anarchism. In other words, anarcha-feminism does not stand for female power or female prime ministers, it stands for organization without power and without prime ministers. 

The double oppression of women demands a double fight and double organizing: on the one hand in feminist federations, on the other hand in the organizations of anarchists. The anarcha-feminists form a junction in this double organizing. 

A serious anarchism must also be feminist otherwise it is a question of patriarchal half-anarchism and not real anarchism. It is the task of the anarcha-feminists to secure the feminist feature in anarchism. There will be no anarchism without feminism. 

An essential point in anarcha-feminism is that the changes must begin today, not tomorrow or after the revolution. The revolution shall be permanent. We must start today by seeing through the oppression in the daily life and do something to break the pattern here and now. 

We must act autonomously, without delegating to any leaders the right to decide what we wish and what we shall do: we must make decisions all by ourselves in personal matters, together with other women in pure female matters, and together with the male fellows in common matters.

***********

The origin of the Anarchafeminist Manifesto. 

8 March, International Women's Day, is a special relevant day to remember the Anarchafeminist Manifesto. The origin of the Anarchafeminist Manifesto is in Norway. The Anarchafeminist Manifesto is the summary of the feminist political program unanimously agreed upon by the third congress of the Anarchist Federation of Norway 1 - 7 of June 1982. The manifesto was first published in Norwegian in Folkebladet (IJA) no 1 1983 pp. 4-5. Soon after the Manifesto was published in CRIFA-Bulletin no 44 mars-avril 1983 in French (p. 12) and English (p. 13) language. Later on the French version was used as the basis for a translation to English that was published on the Internet, see above. The Manifesto is also translated  to other languages. 

Anarchafeminst Greetings from Anna Quist, co-writer of the Anarchafeminst Manifesto.

¬†
Dear Supporter,

New ProLibertad t-shirts...new protest banners...new campaign posters...as we begin this holiday season, we are thinking about how we can broaden the movement to free our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners in the new year!

With every new year comes a sense of much possibility. We are sure this coming year will be a powerful and decisive time for our work to free Oscar Lopez Rivera, Avelino Gonzalez Claudio and Norberto Gonzalez Claudio; we are beginning to do all of the necessary planning to make this happen.

With that in mind, we are launching the ‚ÄúFriends of ProLibertad‚Äù initiative. The ‚ÄúFriends of ProLibertad‚Äù is a network of supporters that will help us reach our goal of $5000 for 2012. A minimum donation of $25 from our supporters will help us purchase a new campaign banner for protests and activities; print new high gloss brochures for distribution; re-launch a professional website; make an updated campaign t-shirt; and cover the costs of the venues we use for public activities.

For 17 years, ProLibertad has worked diligently to build the movement to free the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners with the support of our contributors. As we enter this holiday season and new year, we have high hopes of modernizing our outreach tools, creating new fund-raising opportunities and creating a network of support that will help us reach that inevitable day when Oscar, Avelino and Norberto walk free in their homeland, Puerto Rico.

Your support means so much; it helps us make freedom happen. Your support will reunite Oscar, Avelino and Norberto with their families and friends. These Prisoners of Colonialism have suffered enough and it is time for them to come home!. They should not have to spend any more holidays and New Year‚Äôs Days behind the prison walls of this empire.

Thank you in advance for your donation. We look forward to sending you regular updates on our work and seeing you at our activities in 2012.

Sincerely Yours,
The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign

About MACHETERO: 98 minute film
MACHETERO is a meditation on violence as a means toward liberation. Post 9/11 definitions, ideas and notions of terrorism are challenged in this highly controversial and experimental film. Machetero is an allegorical narrative that follows French journalist Jean Dumont, played by Isaach de Bankol√© (The Keeper, Ghost Dog, Manderlay, Casino Royale, The Limits Of Control), to a New York prison where he interviews Pedro Taino, a so-called "Puerto Rican Terrorist" played by Not4Prophet (lead singer of the Puerto Punk band RICANSTRUCTION). Pedro is a self-described Machetero fighting to free Puerto Rico from the yoke of United States colonialism. He is obsessed with freedom, freedom for his country, his people and for himself. Jean questions Pedro about his decisions to use violence as a means to achieve that freedom. Jean utilizes a global perspective in questioning Pedro, referencing examples of achieving his goals through more peaceful means.¬† However
 Jean soon finds that Pedro is well versed in liberation struggles from around the world and their debate over the use of violence as a catalyst for change escalates.

About MACHETERO: 98 minute film
MACHETERO is a meditation on violence as a means toward liberation. Post 9/11 definitions, ideas and notions of terrorism are challenged in this highly controversial and experimental film. Machetero is an allegorical narrative that follows French journalist Jean Dumont, played by Isaach de Bankol√© (The Keeper, Ghost Dog, Manderlay, Casino Royale, The Limits Of Control), to a New York prison where he interviews Pedro Taino, a so-called "Puerto Rican Terrorist" played by Not4Prophet (lead singer of the Puerto Punk band RICANSTRUCTION). Pedro is a self-described Machetero fighting to free Puerto Rico from the yoke of United States colonialism. He is obsessed with freedom, freedom for his country, his people and for himself. Jean questions Pedro about his decisions to use violence as a means to achieve that freedom. Jean utilizes a global perspective in questioning Pedro, referencing examples of achieving his goals through more peaceful means.¬† However
 Jean soon finds that Pedro is well versed in liberation struggles from around the world and their debate over the use of violence as a catalyst for change escalates. ¬†

Gonz√°lez, the Cuban 5, were arrested by the F.B.I. on trumped-up charges of criminal conspiracy against the U.S. government. The real reason for their imprisonment was that they infiltrated and gathered information 
on the right-wing groups in Miami in order to prevent terrorist attacks 
against Cuba by these groups.  The Cuban 5 have been imprisoned for more than 13 years ‚Äì for defending the sovereignty of their homeland.  Join

PUERTO RICO 
Underground leader admits bombs planted
SAN JUAN -- A guerrilla leader admitted Saturday that his group planted bombs at several banks during a strike by Puerto Rican telephone workers, but not the bomb that wounded a police officer. 
Filiberto Ojeda Rios, leader of the pro-independence People's Boricua Army, made the admission during an interview broadcast on WKAQ-AM radio. 
Two of the station's reporters said they were taken blindfolded to Ojeda's hideout, where they conducted the interview. 

http://estrella51.blogspot.com/2012/04/la-crucifixion-de-filiberto-ojeda-rios.html
La ‚Äúcrucifixi√≥n‚Äù de Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os 
Parece que para la izquierda ser revolucionario es una virtud m√≠stica que merece toda reverencia, respeto, adoraci√≥n y todas las conseciones habidas y por haber. Lo m√°s ins√≥lito es que comparan a Filiberto con Jesucristo, que barbaridad, pero as√≠ son los delincuentes y sus seguidores, justifican los delitos con una desfachatez que dan ganas de vomitar.

Crucifixi√≥n
Mari Mari Narv√°ez, periodista
Uno de los v√©rtigos m√°s espantosos tiene que ser el de evidenciar cuando una persona hace un gran rid√≠culo. La Corporaci√≥n de Cine retir√≥ el financiamiento otorgado al cineasta Freddie Marrero quien, desde 2005, trabaja un documental sobre el revolucionario puertorrique√±o Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os...
¬†
... En este d√≠a de la crucifixi√≥n, me pregunto cu√°ntas veces hay que mandar a matar a Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os.
http://www.elnuevodia.com/columna-crucifixion-1229622.html
¬†
¬øMerece este ‚Äúrevolucionario puertorrique√±o‚Äù hacerle una pel√≠cula para exaltar una vida de delincuencia? ¬øSe justifica que el gobierno utilice el dinero del pueblo para documentar la vida delictiva de este terrorista?
¬†
¬øQui√©n fue Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os? ¬øQue delitos cometieron los Macheteros durante su trayectoria como ‚Äúrevolucionarios‚Äù? ¬øA Filiberto lo mandaron a matar o se resisti√≥ al arresto, dispar√≥ y por eso lo asesinaron? ¬øFue el primer enfrentamiento con el FBI o ya esto hab√≠a pasado antes?
¬†
La historia es larga as√≠ es que aqu√≠ est√°, no est√° todo es solamente un largo resumen, pero hay mucho m√°s de lo que sus seguidores quieren que se sepa y son muchas las figuras de la sociedad puertorrique√±a envueltas en este drama nefasto de la historia de Puerto Rico...
¬†
La Cr√≥nica Gr√°fica 
San Juan, 1987
El Origen de los Macheteros
Por Armando Andr√©
http://laverdadsobreojeda.blogspot.com/
¬†
Despu√©s de organizar las Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional (FALN) en Nueva York en 1974, Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os, el "padrino" del terrorismo puertorrique√±o, regres√≥ a la isla para establecer lo que ser√≠a la principal organizaci√≥n clandestina para tratar de derrocar con la violencia al gobierno democr√°tico de Puerto Rico. Ojeda estuvo escondido durante un tiempo en la Misi√≥n Cubana ante las Naciones Unidas en Nueva York, detectado en 1976 por un grupo de vigilancia del FBI. El 26 de julio de ese a√±o, aniversario del inicio de la revoluci√≥n cubana, Ojeda junto con Juan Enrique Segarra Palmer, Orlando Gonz√°lez Claudio, y otros, fundaron el Ej√©rcito Popular Boricua - Macheteros, al cual aludi√≥ el primer comunicado de la FALN como el "Ej√©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo" que ten√≠a que "organizar las masas para tomar el poder."
¬†

Algunos macheteros perternecieron a la Federaci√≥n Universitaria Pro Independencia (FUPI), filial juvenil del Movimiento Pro Independencia (MPI), donde tambi√©n militaron. Marta S√°nchez Olmeda y Avelino Gonz√°lez Claudio, quien en aquella √©poca usaba el seud√≥nimo "Carmelo", eran de la secci√≥n del MPI en Nueva York y a mediados de la d√©cada de los sesenta, Ojeda los integr√≥ al grupo terrorista Movimiento lndependentista Revolucionario Armado (MIRA), que al ser desarticulado en 1970, ingresaron en la FALN.
¬†
Ojeda, apodado "El G-2 Cubano" por la Polic√≠a de Puerto Rico, porque fue entrenado por la Seguridad de Estado castrista en 1961, tambi√©n era jefe de la Divisi√≥n para el Caribe Oriental de la Junta Coordinadora Revolucionaria (JCR), un organismo del Directorio de Liberaci√≥n Nacional del Departamento Am√©rica del Partido Comunista de Cuba, cuyo prop√≥sito era la "lucha armada" en el hemisferio occidental. El campamento de entrenamiento terrorista de la JCR estaba en Guanabo, Cuba, donde fueron adiestrados los subversivos puertorrique√±os.
¬†
El 2 de enero de 1977 fue juramentado como gobernador de Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barcel√≥, del Partido Nuevo Progresista, cuya meta es la estadidad norteamericana para la isla, y al d√≠a siguiente los subversivos reanudaron, despu√©s de m√°s de un a√±o de inactividad, una desesperada campa√±a terrorista. Dos bombas de iremita sincronizadas a estallar a las ocho y media de la ma√±ana en el edificio del ROTC-en R√≠o Piedras fueron desactivadas por la Polic√≠a 15 minutos antes que detonaran. Romero Barcel√≥ luego declar√≥ que las amenazas y violencia por grupos extremista separatistas "no detendr√°n la concesi√≥n de la estadidad para.Puerto Rico."
¬†
Para financiar las actividades terroristas, los subversivos se convirtieron en expertos asaltadores de bancos. A la 1:45 p.m. del 16 de febrero de 1977, dos hombres y dos mujeres, con armas cortas y largas, vistiendo uniformes color gris y cascos amarillos, irrumpieron en el Banco de Ponce en Arroyo y se llevaron $93,656. Echaron un l√≠quido sobre las camaras de vigilancia y encerraron en los servicios sanitarios a once empleados y nueve clientes, uno de los cuales era un ‚Ä®polic√≠a, que fue desarmado, al igual que el guardia del banco. El arma del polic√≠a le fue ocupada cuatro a√±os despu√©s al subversivo Carlos Fortu√±o Candela, del Movimiento Socialista de Trabajadores (MST), al ser arrestado con artefactos para construir bombas durante los disturbios universitarios.
¬†
Seg√∫n un reporte de inteligencia secreto, que contiene las declaraciones a las autoridades del machetero Carlos Rodr√≠guez Rodr√≠guez, alias "Puma", "Travolta" y "Carlos Karate" el jefe machetero Filiberto Ojeda asign√≥ a Rodr√≠guez que dirigiera el asalto al Banco de Ponce, sucursal Bayam√≥n Oeste, el 5 de agosto de 1977, junto con Jorge Farinacci Garc√≠a, cuyo nombre clandestino es "Roberto", Juan Enrique "Junior" Segarra Palmer y su esposa Luz Mar√≠a "Mima" Berr√≠os Berr√≠os, Jos√© Luis "Rufo" Villegas Fern√°ndez, Walter "Mabo" Tollinchi Garc√≠a, Alejandro "El Chivo" Mart√≠nez Vargas, Angel Marcial "Mosquito" Agosto Agosto, Abraham Fern√°ndez Diamante, Fernando Aguil√∫ Alvarez, y los hermanos "Tino" y Orlando "Jumbo" Gonz√°lez Claudio, y una tal "Diana." El robo bancario fue planificado dos meses antes en una casa de playa al oeste del hotel Cerromar en Dorado.
¬†
A las 8:55 a.m., los macheteros entraron en el banco portando armas autom√°ticas y pistolas con silenciadores, y se situaron en puntos claves. Uno fue a la oficina del gerente, le pidi√≥ que entregara su arma y le indicara donde estaba la alarma del banco. Otro fue a la oficina del subgerente, y los dem√°s reunieron a unos treinta cajeros y clientes a punta de pistola. Dispararon contra las c√°maras de video de seguridad, pero una logr√≥ captar fotos de Juan Segarra y su esposa Lucy Berr√≠os enca√±onando a los clientes con pistolas con silenciadores. En menos de diez minutos, recogieron el dinero de los cajeros y dos sacos de la b√≥veda, con un total de $73,283.43, pero cuando se daban a la fuga, dispararon una r√°faga de ametralladora contra los cristales de la puerta y las ventanas, para amedrentar a los curiosos, y se les cay√≥ un saco con $40,000 que fue recuperado.
¬†
Farinacci y dos asaltantes huyeron en un Chevy Nova color marr√≥n, perseguidos por la polic√≠a hasta el sector Santa Rita, donde abandonaron el carro y se internaron en un monte. Entraron en una residencia y obligaron a un se√±or que los llevara en su auto a las Parcelas Van Scoy, donde desaparecieron. Las huellas digitales de Farinacci fueron halladas en el espejo retrovisor del Nova.
¬†
El bot√≠n fue llevado por Carlos Rodr√≠guez, Orlando Gonz√°lez Claudio y Juan Segarra a una casa en una monta√±a en un √°rea rural desolada de Vega Baja, donde tambi√©n dejaron las armas empleadas en el asalto. Tres semanas despu√©s los participantes se reunieron en el apartamento 41-2 del Condominio Jardines Metropolitanos, perteneciente a Farinacci, para discutir las cr√≠ticas del robo.
¬†
El 22 de septiembre de 1977, los Macheteros asesinaron al abogado laboral Alan Henry Randall, quien hab√≠a representado varios casos contra la Uni√≥n de Tronquistas al asociarlo con la Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA). Randall recibi√≥ un balazo 9mm. en la boca y otro que le atraves√≥ el cerebro. Un comunicado de un llamado "Comando Obrero" se√±al√≥ que "en su momento se har√° p√∫blico el nombre de la organizaci√≥n responsable de esta acci√≥n." Sin embargo, como el atentado a Randall fue masivamente repudiado por la mayor√≠a de las facciones separatistas, los Macheteros nunca llegaron a atribuirse el hecho. La viuda, Marlene "Tamby" Randall, se suicid√≥ el 24 de enero de 1978 tir√°ndose del vig√©simosegundo piso del condominio Condado Real. El caso Randall fue ampliamente divulgado en nuestra edici√≥n n√∫mero 135 de abril de 1987.
¬†

Carlos Rodr√≠guez, organizador tronquista en aquella √©poca, se√±al√≥ a los actuales asesores legales de la Uni√≥n de Tronquistas, Jorge Farinacci, Miguel Cabrera Figueroa, junto con el organizador tronquista Luis Carri√≥n Mart√≠nez, y los macheteros Alejandro Mart√≠nez Vargas, Angel Agosto, Radam√©s "Emiliano" Acosta Cepeda, Eliseo "Gabino" Alejandro Ortiz, Jos√© Villegas y Walter Tollinchi Garc√≠a, como participantes en la planificaci√≥n y las fases de ejecuci√≥n del asesinato de Randall. Rodr√≠guez dijo que fueron designados como "haladores de gatillo" Angel Agosto Agosto y el dominicano Alejandro Mart√≠nez Vargas, conocido por los seud√≥nimos "Dominiqui", "El Chivo", "Joe" y "Pupito".
¬†
El CRP era el brazo armado clandestino de la Liga Socialista Puertorrique√±a (LSP) que dirig√≠a Juan Antonio Corretjer Montes. El jefe del CRP era Elizam Escobar, herido el 4 de marzo de 1970 durante un mot√≠n en la Universidad de Puerto Rico en R√≠o Piedras. Despu√©s que a William Morales le estall√≥ una bomba que le cercen√≥ las manos en julio de 1978, Corretjer envi√≥ a Escobar a integrar la FALN en Nueva York para reemplazarlo. En 1980, Escobar fue sentenciado en una corte federal de Chicago a 60 a√±os de presidio por los actos terroristas de la FALN.
¬†
El 11 de octubre de 1977, mientras la Primera Dama estadounidense Rosalynn Carter visitaba Puerto Rico, esa madrugada los CRP detonaron bombas en la entrada de las oficinas Esso Caribbean, cerca del Centro Comercial San Patricio en Puerto Nuevo, causando m√°s de $5,000 en da√±os, y en el jard√≠n de la Compa√±√≠a Mobil en La Cer√°mica, Carolina, sin ocasionar perjuicios. El mismo d√≠a la FALN deton√≥ en Nueva York artefactos incendiarios en las tiendas Macy's de Brooklyn y Gimbel's de Manhattan, una bomba estall√≥ a las 4 p.m. en la escalinata de la biblioteca p√∫blica en la Calle 42, y otra fue desactivada en el edificio de la General Motors. El comunicado de la FALN senal√≥ que "la acci√≥n pol√≠tica militar de hoy muestra la fuerza disciplinada y unida de nuestra organizaci√≥n en su lucha contra el imperialismo yanqui."
¬†
1979-1982 La Etapa Mas Sangrienta
Despu√©s del triunfo de la revoluci√≥n Sandinista en Nicaragua en julio de 1979, Filiberto Ojeda recibi√≥ √≥rdenes de Cuba para consolidar a todos los grupos terroristas puertorrique√±os en un solo mando directivo, igual que el r√©gimen de La Habana hab√≠a logrado la unidad de los sandinistas y posteriormente de las diferentes guerrillas salvadore√±as. El Departamento Am√©rica del Partido Comunista cubano quer√≠a bregar con una sola representaci√≥n boricua por razones de seguridad y para canalizar sus labores. Como resultado, en septiembre de 1979, en una reuni√≥n entre el jefe machetero Filiberto Ojeda, Juan Antonio "Olmo" Corretjer Montes, dirigente de la Liga Socialista Puertorrique√±a (LSP) y miembro del Comando Central de las Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional (FALN), y Federico "Javier" Cintr√≥n Fiallo, presidente de las Fuerzas Armadas de Resistencia Popular (FARP), se cre√≥ el mando directivo a trav√©s del Partido Revolucionario de los
 Trabajadores Puertorrique√±os (PRTP), que incorporaba el Ej√©rcito Popular Boricua - Macheteros, la FALN, la FARP, y la Organizaci√≥n de Voluntarios para la Revoluci√≥n Puertorrique√±a (OVRP), que es un desprendimiento clandestino de la Liga Socialista Puertorrique√±a.
¬†
En su primer comunicado el 22 de septiembre de 1979, las cinco organizaciones anunciaron que estaban bregando juntos, y que"luchar√≠an hasta lograr la victoria final contra el imperialismo y los traidores que le sirven." Exhortaron a los trabajadores a combatir "la represi√≥n a la clase obrera y sus aparatos sindicales."
¬†
A las nueve de la noche del martes 2 de octubre de 1979, cuatro hombres y una mujer de la FARP, armados con pistolas, dos escopetas recortadas y un rifle autom√°tico, irrumpieron en el bar La Hacienda frente a la entrada principal de la Base Naval de Roosevelt Roads en Ceiba. Diez militares y civiles que trabajaban para la Marina fueron alineados contra la pared y advertidos: "No vamos a matarlos esta vez, pero podr√≠amos hacerlo. Queremos que piensen sobre esto la pr√≥xima vez que est√©n bombardeando Vieques."Los asaltantes rociaron l√≠quido inflamable en el piso y prendieron fuego al establecimiento, huyendo en una camioneta azul. Los clientes lograron escapar y regresaron a la base naval.
¬†
La primera acci√≥n coordinada del mando directivo fue la colocaci√≥n de ocho bombas en Puerto Rico y Chicago el 17 de octubre de 1979, con parte de la iremita robada en Manat√≠ el a√±o anterior. Un artefacto deton√≥ en el edificio de Aduana Federal de San Juan y en el de Fajardo otro fue desmantelado. Un niple con iremita estall√≥ detr√°s del monumento de la Guerra Hispanoamericana en Gu√°nica, y otro deton√≥ en una de las torres de la Guardia Costanera en San Juan. La quinta bomba explot√≥ en Aguadilla, causando graves da√±os al sistema de comunicaciones de radar de la Marina en la Base Ramey.
¬†

Los artefactos explosivos colocados por la FALN en Chicago estallaron en un ba√±o del edificio Cook County y frente a un edificio de madera desocupado del Centro de Adiestramiento Naval Great Lakes, rompiendo las ventanas. Otra bomba fue desmantelada en el edificio que alberga las oficinas del Partido Republicano en Chicago. En Nueva York dejaron varios niples que no contentan explosivos.
El comunicado conjunto de los Macheteros, la FALN, la OVRP y la FARP, dijo que era parte de "una campa√±a politicomilitar contra el imperialismo norteamericano," y tambi√©n protestando contra los juicios a 21 separatistas acusados de impedir las maniobras navales en Vieques. La acci√≥n terrorista parec√≠a estar en solidaridad con Cuba, ya que en la madrugada del 17 de octubre 1,800 Marinos realizaron un simulacro de invasi√≥n en la Base Naval estadounidense en Guant√°namo, Cuba, en una postura de fuerza ante el militarismo de Fidel Castro.
¬†
El 3 de diciembre de 1979, los Macheteros, la OVRP y la FARP, le tendieron una emboscada a una guagua de la Marina con 18 t√©cnicos de comunicaciones desarmados en la carretera 866 a un kil√≥metro de la base de Sabana Seca. A las 6:40 a.m., una camioneta verde conducida por Orlando Gonz√°lez Claudio pas√≥ la guagua, aminorando la velocidad frente a ella, y cuando lleg√≥ al sitio donde esperaba un van Dodge blanco estacionado a la izquierda de la carretera, par√≥ repentinamente y toc√≥ la bocina. Desde el van Juan Segarra Palmer, Carlos Rodr√≠guez Rodr√≠guez, Noel Col√≥n Gonz√°lez de la FARP, y otros dos apodados "Isaac" y "Pancho," quienes usaban capuchas, rociaron el lado izquierdo de la guagua con 47 impactos de ametralladoras AK47, M-16 y Thompson calibre 45, matando a los marinos Emil E. White y John Ball e hiriendo a diez, incluyendo a tres mujeres. Los Macheteros denominaron la operaci√≥n "Dry Cleaning," que para ellos significaba "limpieza de
 gringos."
¬†
Los terroristas dejaron la camioneta y huyeron en el van, que hab√≠a sido reportado robado y luego lo abandonaron, donde la polic√≠a ocup√≥ silenciadores, tapones para los oidos, 8 casquillos de un M-16 y tachuelas. La acci√≥n fue planificada por Ojeda, quien le di√≥ el visto bueno a los planes finales. En un comunicado de prensa se√±alaron que el ataque era en represalia por el "asesinato" de Angel Rodr√≠guez Crist√≥bal, de la Liga Socialista Puertorrique√±a, quien se ahorc√≥ en la prisi√≥n federal de Tallahassee el 11 de noviembre de 1979. Rodr√≠guez, veterano de la guerra de Vietnam, hab√≠a sido sentenciado a varios meses de presidio junto con otros 20 subversivos por impedir las maniobras navales en Vieques, y llevaba 19 d√≠as en una celda solitaria de castigo por negarse a trabajar.
¬†

A las 7:45 a.m. del 12 de marzo de 1980, los Macheteros efectuaron la "operaci√≥n militar" denominada "Pitirre". Dos hombres y una mujer en un veh√≠culo en el puente del Expreso las Am√©ricas, sobre la Avenida Domenech, dispararon una r√°faga de ametralladora que caus√≥ siete impactos en el lado derecho del carro donde viajaban los oficiales del Ej√©rcito, coronel Charles Tucker, su ayudante el teniente coronel Robert L. Davenport, y el sargento mayor Aurelio Mora Rodr√≠guez, quienes resultaron ilesos. Los tres eran profesores de Ciencias Militares del ROTC que se dirig√≠an de la Base Buchanan a la Universidad de Puerto Rico. El comunicado de los Macheteros se√±al√≥ que "ning√∫n militar yanqui debe sentirse seguro pisando nuestro suelo," a√±adiendo que las primarias dem√≥cratas presidenciales celebradas tres d√≠as antes, por primera vez en la historia de Puerto Rico, eran una farsa comparable a los comicios de Hitler.
¬†
En la madrugada del 14 de julio de 1980, artefactos explosivos de la OVRP destruyeron tres torres de se√±ales de la Agencia Federal de Aviaci√≥n en Ponce, Mayag√ºez y Vega Baja, para navegaci√≥n a√©rea comercial, y otra bomba desactiv√≥ el radio-faro de la Guardia Costanera en el puerto de San Juan. Cerca de unos transformadores en la torre de Vega Baja se ocup√≥ un niple que no estall√≥. Las p√©rdidas sumaron m√°s de un mill√≥n de d√≥lares y el tr√°fico a√©reo entre Am√©rica del Sur, el Caribe y Estados Unidos tuvo que ser relocalizado durante una semana. En esos d√≠as la Marina norteamericana realizaba las maniobras "Readex" con las fuerzas armadas de Venezuela y Brasil, y efectuaron un desembarco en Vieques.
¬†
El 22 de julio de 1980, a las 2 a.m., niples de poca potencia estallaron en los correos de la Parada 24 en Santurce y el de R√≠o Piedras. Otros dos artefactos fueron desmantelados en los correos de Sabana Seca y Hato Rey. Los Comandos Revolucionarios del Pueblo (CRP), en un comunicado escrito a m√°quina, que en un extremo tiene dibujado una metralleta y el lema "De pie y en guerra," se responsabilizaron por las bombas, e hicieron un recuento de los nueve atentados contra facilidades del gobierno federal que hab√≠an realizado desde 1977.
¬†
El 19 de septiembre de 1980, el FBI declar√≥ que Jos√© Alberto Adorno Maldonado y Jorge Zayas Candal, quienes fueron asesinados en Carolina, Puerto Rico, estaban en la lista de 23 sospechosos de haber participado en el ataque en Sabana Seca, algunos de los cuales hab√≠an sido citados ante un gran jurado federal, al igual que el machetero Luis Alfredo "Manuel" Col√≥n Osorio, quien hac√≠a 11 d√≠as se hab√≠a desaparecido de su residencia en Trujillo Alto. Un vocero del izquierdista Comit√© Unitario Contra la Represi√≥n (CUCRE) dijo que estaban investigando la situaci√≥n, pero no volvieron a mencionar los asesinatos, que nunca fueron esclarecidos.
¬†
La querella policiaca No. 8116-05916 indica que el 11 de agosto de 1980, cuando el machetero Adorno Maldonado, de 25 a√±os, arrib√≥ a las 7:30 p.m. en su auto a su residencia en la Calle Milagros Cabeza J-3 en Carolina Alta, llegaron varios individuos en un "van" blanco quienes hablaron con √©1 y le dispararon tres balazos por la espalda. El reporte de autopsia No. 2327-80 se√±ala que Adorno estaba borracho. Junto al cad√°ver la polic√≠a encontr√≥ una pistola 9 mm. y en su carro hab√≠a una escopeta recortada.
¬†
Diez meses antes, el 15 de octubre de 1979, Adorno Maldonado, hijo del presunto bolitero "Chiquit√≠n" Adorno, junto con Luis Col√≥n Osorio y Jorge Zayas Candal, secuestraron al bolitero Miguel Angel Pellicea Moll, de 62 a√±os, en Vistamar Bah√≠a, Carolina, y lo escondieron en una casa de campa√±a en un bosque en Cubuy, Can√≥vanas, donde lo torturaron sac√°ndole las u√±as con tenazas, quem√°ndole los brazos con cigarrillos y rompi√©ndole los dientes. Cuando Col√≥n y Adorno fueron a su casa a recoger los $100,000 que pidieron de rescate, los captur√≥ el jefe de la Divisi√≥n de Arrestos Especiales de la Polic√≠a, el notorio teniente Julio C√©sar "El Negro" Andrade, luego expulsado de la uniformada por asesino y corrupto, quien les propin√≥ una sonada paliza para que confesaran donde estaba el reh√©n. Para asaltar el lugar donde manten√≠an a la v√≠ctima, Andrade us√≥ a Co1√≥n Osorio como un escudo humano, quien recibi√≥ de los otros macheteros un balazo en
 el est√≥mago al producirse el tiroteo. El expediente judicial M79-276768 indica que el caso fue archivado el 20 de febrero de 1980, "debido a que los testigos esenciales, Sr. Miguel A. Pellicea Moll y esposa Miriam Torres se trasladaron a Estados Unidos y no tienen inter√©s en continuar con el caso." Algunos investigadores de homicidio opinan que Pellicea mand√≥ a matar a Adorno Maldonado y Zayas Candal en venganza por el secuestro, y Col√≥n Osorio logr√≥ salvarse al desaparecerse una temporada.
¬†
A las 9 de la ma√±ana del 14 de noviembre de 1980, una patrulla de vigilancia en el Fuerte Allen detect√≥ una mina antipersonal de fabricaci√≥n casera colocada en la verja de la instalaci√≥n, donde hab√≠an roto la tela met√°lica para acomodarla, con dos cables que corr√≠an hacia el interior para hacer detonaci√≥n si los hubieran pisado. El artefacto de 25 libras conten√≠a 10 libras de nitrato amonio y un envase con clavos, tuercas, alambre y otros metales, con un alcance de 100 metros de distancia.
¬†
El d√≠a antes se hab√≠a anunciado que all√≠ ser√≠an alojados refugiados cubanos y haitianos. Un comunicado de dos p√°ginas que la FARP envi√≥ a la prensa dice que coloc√≥ la mina en protesta por "el abuso de poder del imperialismo de imponerle a Puerto Rico un campo de concentraci√≥n," y termin√≥ diciendo, "√©ste es nuestro tercer ataque contra la marina yanqui. Aunque en esta ocasi√≥n no hubo bajas, les prometemos que en la pr√≥xima si las habr√° y que en suelo puertorrique√±o no hay lugar seguro para el enemigo, ni fuera ni dentro de sus bases militares." El Departamento de Estado posteriormente suspendi√≥ los planes de alojar a los refugiados y traslad√≥ a la mayor√≠a del personal militar que los iban a atender.
¬†
A la 1:45 de la madrugada del domingo 11 de enero de 1981, los Macheteros destruyeron 8 jets de combate Corsair A7D y un viejo F104 desactivado, de los 20 aviones de la Guardia Nacional en la Base A√©rea Mu√±iz en Isla Verde. Veintitr√©s niples con iremita y mecanismos de tiempo sofisticados fueron colocados en los conductos de las turbinas y el tren de aterrizaje de cada avi√≥n. Tres bombas que no detonaron fueron desactivadas. Al estallar los tanques de combustible de los jets, el fuego hizo disparar las balas de las ametralladoras. Un cami√≥n de la Guardia Nacional fue averiado, al igual que equipo de salvamento, causando un total de $45 millones en da√±os. Cerca del dep√≥sito de gasolina, dejaron un machete con las siglas E.P.B. (Ej√©rcito Popular Boricua) y la bandera de los Macheteros.
¬†
El operativo, denominado "La Gaviota," lo realizaron Juan Segarra Palmer, Orlando Gonz√°lez Claudio, e Isaac Camacho Negr√≥n, quienes cruzaron los manglares en la parte posterior de la base y cortaron la cerca de alambre eslabonado. Filiberto Ojeda, alias "Jos√©," los esper√≥ en una playa cercana. La base de entrenamiento estaba custodiada por solamente dos centinelas, uno de los cuales estaba en una garita en la entrada, y el otro hac√≠a la ronda en un vehiculo.
¬†
El ataque fue realizado en el aniversario del natalicio del pr√≥cer independentista Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos. Ese mismo d√≠a, Fidel Castro pronunci√≥ un discurso de hora y media alegando que el pueblo cubano respalda la revoluci√≥n "aunque desembarquen aqu√≠ 10,000 tanques" norteamericanos. Una semana y media antes, el gobernador proestadista Carlos Romero Barce1√≥ hab√≠a iniciado su segundo t√©rmino de gobierno, enfureciendo a los separatistas.
¬†
Los Macheteros filmaron una pel√≠cula de video en la que se les ve√≠a prepar√°ndose para el ataque con uniformes y botas militares. La cinta grabada fue enviada a la reportera izquierdista Carmen Jovet, quien rehus√≥ entregarla al FBI y la mostr√≥ repetidamente en su programa de noticias.
¬†
En la noche del 15 de marzo de 1981, la FARP dej√≥ una bomba de 25 libras de nitrato amonio mezclado con petr√≥leo en el ba√∫l de un Pontiac Lemans estacionado en el s√≥tano del Centro de Convenciones en Condado, donde iba a hablar el ex secretario de Estado Henry Kissinger en la conferencia "Asuntos Mundiales" auspiciada por la Universidad Mundial. Al llegar a San Juan esa tarde, Kissinger dijo que "personalmente prefer√≠a la estadidad o el Estado Libre Asociado para Puerto Rico" en vez de la independencia. La FARP llam√≥ dos veces a la polic√≠a con el prop√≥sito de que al abrir el carro estallara la bomba, pero fall√≥ el mecanismo de detonaci√≥n. Expertos en explosivos estiman que la fuerza de expansi√≥n de ese artefacto hubiera derrumbado gran parte del edificio.
¬†
A las 2:45 p.m. del martes 21 de abril de 1981, dos hombres y una mujer asaltaron a dos guardias de un cami√≥n blindado de la Wells Fargo frente a Glidden Paint en la calle Parque, marginal Baldorioty de Castro, en Santurce, y se llevaron dos bolsas con $348,400, responsabiliz√°ndose los Macheteros por el robo.
¬†
El 11 de julio de 1981, los Macheteros asesinaron a su camarada Jos√© Guillermo Zambrana Garc√≠a, de 23 a√±os, quien hab√≠a estado implicado en el fraude de $2.5 millones de d√≥lares en cheques de agencias del gobierno de Puerto Rico y grandes empresas, operaci√≥n que dirig√≠a Carlos Rodr√≠guez Rodr√≠guez, su esposa espa√±ola Isabel Pa√±os Agull√≥, Alejandro "El Chivo" Mart√≠nez Vargas, Antonio "Tony Gas" Col√≥n P√©rez, Jos√© Manuel "Papo" Fines Caballero y William Irizarry. El dinero obtenido iba para las arcas de los Macheteros. 
¬†
Cuando Zambrana trat√≥ de cambiar uno de esos cheques por $4,000 en una sucursal del Banco de Ponce en dicha ciudad, haci√©ndose pasar como un ejecutivo de empresa, fue arrestado el 22 de diciembre de 1980 y delat√≥ la trama al FBI. Cuando Rodr√≠guez observ√≥ que era seguido por las autoridades, sospech√≥ que Zambrana lo hab√≠a traicionado y decidi√≥ matarlo.
¬†
Despu√©s de buscarlo durante un mes, Zambrana fue localizado el s√°bado 11 de julio. Rodr√≠guez, junto con Mart√≠nez Vargas, fue a buscar una escopeta calibre 16 que "Tony Gas" le guardaba en su casa en Barrio Obrero. Los tres Macheteros, armados con pistolas, se trasladaron en un auto hasta el Bar EddieLandia en Santurce. Rodr√≠guez, usando una gorra de esquiar estilo antifaz, entr√≥ en el negocio a la una de la madrugada, mientras sus dos compa√±eros manten√≠an a unos 20 clientes enca√±onados afuera en la acera. Rodr√≠guez acribill√≥ a Zambrana con tres escopetazos y varios disparos de pistola 9 mm. y se retir√≥ con sus dos c√≥mplices.
¬†
Estando el cad√°ver de Zambrana en la funeraria, durante la noche alguien forz√≥ la caja, rebuscaron adentro, y le echaron colillas de marihuana. Su viuda, Minerva Febles Pab√≥n, se√±al√≥ a la polic√≠a en la querella 1266-4492, que localizaran a "Papo" Fines, Carlos Rodr√≠guez, alias "Carlos Karate," y su esposa Isabel Pa√±os Agull√≥.
El cad√°ver del machetero Fines, de 34 a√±os, de quien tambi√©n sospecharon estaba colaborando con el FBI, apareci6 el 10 de diciembre de 1981 a la orilla de la playa de Dorado, en la carretera 165, kil√≥metro 23.7, con seis balazos en el torax, seg√∫n la querella policiaca 7-02602752. El licenciado Angel Fines Ferrer, hermano del occiso, declar√≥ a las autoridades que Papo "no ten√≠a trabajo y se dedicaba a las apuestas de dinero."
¬†
Despu√©s de las nueve de la noche del 17 de agosto de 1981, Carlos Rodr√≠guez Rodr√≠guez y Antonio "Tony Gas" Col√≥n P√©rez recogieron en la Avenida Baldorioty de Castro en Miramar a dos marineros vestidos de civil, Steven D. Miller, de 18 a√±os, y Thomas Steimburg, 21, quienes se dirig√≠an a la Base Naval Roosevelt Roads en Ceiba. Seg√∫n la querella policiaca No. 8-11606090, el conductor se detuvo en el negocio de B.B.Q. en la marginal en Isla Verde y compr√≥ cuatro cervezas. Dos millas m√°s adelante, Rodr√≠guez par√≥ s√∫bitamente debajo del puente de la Avenida Monserrate y sac√≥ una pistola. Steimburg se desmont√≥ por la puerta trasera del Chevy Nova y recibi√≥ disparos en el brazo derecho y en el est√≥mago. Cuando Miller se baj√≥, sufri√≥ cinco balazos en el torax y la espalda, seg√∫n el reporte de autopsia No. 1921-81, que le causaron la muerte.
¬†
Steimburg sobrevivi√≥ y se√±al√≥ a la polic√≠a en la querella No. 8116-06090 que el pasajero estaba enyesado de la cintura hacia arriba debido a un accidente de tr√°nsito, quien les dijo que estuvo en el ej√©rcito y hab√≠a residido en California. Las autoridades se dirigieron al Centro M√©dico, donde les informaron que el yeso de medio cuerpo se lo hab√≠an puesto a Antonio Col√≥n P√©rez, por lo que el 16 de noviembre de 1981 se le someti√≥ orden de arresto por asesinato e intento de asesinato.
¬†
"Tony Gas," de 34 a√±os de edad, estaba fugitivo desde el 24 de septiembre por los casos pendientes G81-3446 tras su arresto por distribuci√≥n de coca√≠na el 2 de febrero, y el G812431 al 2433 por haber asesinado de seis balazos a Abraham Febres Oliveras el 23 de abril en Barrio Obrero, junto con Luis A. Santiago Sosa.
¬†
A las 12:20 a.m. de la madrugada del mi√©rcoles 11 de noviembre de 1981, los Macheteros detonaron una bomba en la subestaci√≥n de la Autoridad de Energ√≠a El√©ctrica en la calle Wilson del Condado, averiando los radiadores del sistema de enfriamiento. El servicio no fue afectado porque la carga fue transferida a otras subestaciones. Dos d√≠as antes, hab√≠a concluido una huelga de dos meses y medio de los miembros de la Uni√≥n de Trabajadores de la Industria E1√©ctrica y Riego (UTIER), que presid√≠a el subversivo Luis Lausell Hern√°ndez, militante del PSP.
¬†
A las 8:50 p.m. del 27 de noviembre de 1981, un artefacto explosivo destruy√≥ totalmente la subestaci√≥n de la Autoridad de Energ√≠a E1√©ctrica en la Calle Vieques, esquina Baldorioty en Santurce, y da√±√≥ cinco camiones. Trece minutos despu√©s estall√≥ otra bomba en la subestaci√≥n de la calle Taft, ambas con p√©rdidas de m√°s de un mill√≥n de d√≥lares y dejaron a oscuras durante 24 horas los sectores de Condado, Miramar y Santurce. Un comunicado de los Macheteros se√±al√≥ que los ataques eran en represalia por la pol√≠tica del gobernador Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ por emplear la tropa de choque de la Polic√≠a en los casos de los intrusos de Villa Sin Miedo y contra los estudiantes izquierdistas amotinados en la universidad.
¬†
A la una de la madrugada del domingo 16 de mayo de 1982, los marinos Darryl T. Phillips, de 22 a√±os, Larry S. Skowronski, 21, Randall Lee Keyte, 23, y Anthony Lloyd Phanevf, 20, vestidos de civil, salieron del bar Black Angus y caminaron por la Avenida Fern√°ndez Juncos hacia el buque de guerra USS Pensacola, anclado en el muelle 3 de San Juan. Frente al Club N√°utico hab√≠a un Chevrolet Malib√∫, color oro, con el motor encendido, ocupado por tres macheteros. Cuando los marinos pasaron frente al auto, √©ste comenz√≥ a moverse, prendieron las luces, y desde adentro dispararon una r√°faga de balas de ametralladora calibre 45. Phillips fue asesinado de cinco balazos, Keyte recibi√≥ tres impactos en el abdomen, Phanevf fue herido en el lado derecho del torax, y Skowronski fue herido en la cintura, seg√∫n la querella policiaca 1-166-02068. El Malib√∫ fue abandonado en la calle Central en Santurce, y sus dos ocupantes se fueron en otros dos carros azules que
 los segu√≠an. En el interior del auto la polic√≠a ocup√≥ 17 casquillos calibre 45 y un testigo di√≥ una descripci√≥n de uno de los individuos. Los Macheteros alegaron en una llamada telef√≥nica que el ataque era en represalia por las maniobras navales "Ocean Venture" en la isla de Vieques.
¬†
Un mes despu√©s, Ricarte Montes Garc√≠a, de 34 a√±os, Secretario Regional de la Liga Socialista Puertorrique√±a que dirig√≠a Juan Antonio Corretjer, fue sentenciado a 18 meses de presidio por negarse a testificar ante un gran jurado federal investigando el ataque a los marinos. Una testigo identific√≥ a Montes, de un album de 184 fotograf√≠as del FBI, como uno de los individuos que abandon√≥ el Malib√∫ usado en el atentado.
El 30 de mayo de 1982, los Macheteros dejaron en una habitaci√≥n del hotel Caribe Hilton en San Juan, cuatro recipientes con gasolina y un tanque de gas, que no estall√≥ porque el mecanismo de detonaci√≥n estaba defectuoso.
¬†
El 10 de junio de 1982, la FARP coloc√≥ tres bombas en el condominio Marbella del Caribe Oeste, en represalia por el desalojo policiaco de los intrusos de Villa Sin Miedo, en R√≠o Grande, el 18 de mayo. A las 10:55 p.m., un artefacto destruy√≥ un transformador en el piso siete y 25 minutos despu√©s otra en el cuarto de desperdicios del cuarto piso rompi√≥ una pared interna. La otra bomba fue desmantelada y no hubieron heridos. Los terroristas equivocadamente cre√≠an que all√≠ resid√≠a el Secretario de la Vivienda, Jorge Pierluisi, "uno de los instrumentos del imperialismo norteamericano," se√±a1√≥ el comunicado de la FARP, que advierte que "sirva esta peque√±a muestra para los que tienen lujosas residencias, autom√≥viles y dem√°s comodidades de c√≥mo se sinti√≥ la comunidad de Villa Sin Miedo."
¬†
El 1 de septiembre de 1982, los Macheteros fracasaron en el intento de robar un cami√≥n blindado de la Wells Fargo que iba de San Juan a Naranjito. Los asaltantes usaban m√°scaras, ten√≠an uniformes de camuflage y portaban radios de comunicaci√≥n port√°tiles, armas largas autom√°ticas con silenciadores y pistolas calibre 45.
¬†
A las 8:50 a.m. del martes 16 de noviembre de 1982, cinco Macheteros con armas largas asaltaron el supermercado Conchita en Villa Fontana, obligando al gerente a abrir la caja fuerte, sustrayendo $1,000, y obligando a los clientes y empleados a pasar a la parte de atr√°s de la tienda. Minutos despu√©s, Ileg√≥ un cami√≥n blindado de la Well's Fargo, y cuando el guardia entr√≥ en el local, lo enca√±onaron y le quitaron su rev√≥lver y las llaves del cami√≥n, se√±ala la querella policiaca No. 8-1168024. En ese momento, lleg√≥ un "van" blanco del cual salieron varios Macheteros con carabinas calibre 30, quienes enca√±onaron al chofer del cami√≥n blindado, y se llevaron $336,550. Durante la fuga, asesinaron de un disparo de carabina en el pecho a Angel Luis Hern√°ndez Cruz, de 35 a√±os, seg√∫n el informe de autopsia No. 2496-82, quien era gerente de la cercana gasolinera Texaco y se dirig√≠a al lugar del asalto con un rev√≥lver en la cintura. Una docena de
 Macheteros part√≠cipes usaron seis veh√≠culos para el asalto, dos de los cuales fueron abandonados en calles cercanas. Un mes despu√©s, el subversivo Raymond Soto D√°vila fue citado ante un gran jurado federal como sospechoso de haber participado en el asalto, y sentenciado a 16 meses de presidio por desacato cuando se neg√≥ a testificar.
¬†
A fines del verano de 1983, Jorge Farinacci,se encontr√≥ en el sector Condado con un activista cubano anticomunista, a quien los izquierdistas acusan de haber matado al agente castrista Carlos Mu√±iz Varela, y Farinacci le dispar√≥ por la espalda. Otro cubano exiliado ripost√≥, d√°ndole dos balazos en el est√≥mago a Farinacci, quien al caer logr√≥ de casualidad herirlo en una pierna. Oficiales de inteligencia estiman que Farinacci pudo haber recibido auxilio clandestino en el Instituto de Medicina de Familia, en el 1028 Ave. Roosevelt, Puerto Nuevo, al que se refieren como "El hospitalillo de los Macheteros," porque all√≠ trabajan los m√©dicos presuntos macheteros V√≠ctor R. Mercado D√≠az y H√©ctor Pesquera. Otros empleados subversivos incluyen a Salvador de la Cruz El√≠as, del Movimiento Socialista de Trabajadores (MST); Carmen Acevedo Vicente, arrestada en Luquillo en 1976 con 1,357 libras de explosivos; Belkis, la nuera del jefe machetero Filiberto
 Ojeda; y la esposa del machetero Rub√©n Ramos Acosta. El Instituto de Medicina de Familia y sus sucursales en Bayam√≥n, Caguas y Humacao, se anuncian en el semanario comunista Claridad, y muchos de su clientela son separatistas.
¬†
El robo de $7 millones de la Wells Fargo
¬†
El lunes 12 de septiembre de 1983, fecha del natalicio del l√≠der Nacionalista Pedro Albizu Campos, los Macheteros robaron $7 millones de las oficinas de la Wells Fargo en Hartford, Connecticut, con la ayuda del empleado V√≠ctor Manuel Gerena Ort√≠z, de 25 a√±os de edad, reclutado por el machetero Eliseo "Gabino" Alejandro Ort√≠z, hijo de un ministro de una iglesia protestante en Hartford. El robo fue planificado con Filiberto Ojeda y Juan Segarra Palmer durante 18 meses. El 19 de marzo de 1983, Segarra hizo una llamada de 7 minutos desde su residencia en la calle Taft del Condado, seg√∫n demuestran los records telef√≥nicos, al apartamento de Gerena en Hartford.
¬†
Gerena naci√≥ en el Bronx, el mayor de cinco hijos de una familia puertorrique√±a. Su padre siempre lo critic√≥ severamente por ser un fracasado. Cuando ten√≠a doce a√±os, sus padres se separaron y V√≠ctor fue a vivir con su madre y hermanos al residencial p√∫blico de Charter Oak en Hartford, Connecticut, cuya pobreza le cre√≥ un complejo antisocial. Trabaj√≥ de interno en la c√°mara de representantes estatal, donde una funcionaria le consigui√≥ una beca en la universidad cat√≥lica Annhurst. Sus compa√±eros de dormitorio eran venezolanos hijos de millonarios, lo cual agudiz√≥ su complejo de inferioridad, y Gerena cre√≥ un ambiente hostil criticando a los capitalistas "que chupaban la sangre de los pobres," a la polic√≠a como "puercos," y al gobierno norteamericano como "colonialista", lo cual le inculc√≥ su madre, una activista del Partido Socialista Puertorrique√±o (PSP). Gerena, acostumbrado a hablar "spanglish," recibi√≥ suspenso hasta en la
 asignatura de espa√±ol, frustr√°ndose a√∫n m√°s, dej√≥ de ir a clases, y fue expulsado de la universidad durante el primer semestre despu√©s que us√≥ el tel√©fono de la oficina para hacer llamadas de larga distancia no autorizadas y se neg√≥ a pagarlas.
¬†
La vida personal de Gerena era tan desordenada como sus estudios. Viviendo en concubinato con Maggie Ru√≠z, la abandon√≥ cuando estaba encinta para casarse con Pamela Anderson. Cuando √©sta iba a tener una hija, la dej√≥ y regres√≥ con Maggie por dos a√±os, posteriormente teniendo que pagarle $150 mensuales a ambas de pensi√≥n alimenticia, lo cual lo ten√≠a desesperado porque deb√≠a $3,000 y las dos mujeres lo amenazaban con encarcelario. Gerena trabaj√≥ de manera espor√°dica en empleos de poco sueldo como despachando gasolina, chofer, operador de m√°quina en una f√°brica, y ayudante de maestro, siendo despedido de muchos trabajos por falta de asistencia. 
¬†

En la primavera de 1982, Gerena solicit√≥ un pr√©stamo estudiantil de $2,500 con el Central Connecticut State College, no asisti√≥ a clases y nunca devolvi√≥ el dinero. En marzo de 1982, el machetero Juan Segarra Palmer visit√≥ a Gerena y le pidi√≥ que aplicara como guardia de seguridad con Wells Fargo para efectuar el robo que ayudar√≠a a la causa separatista, lo cual le di√≥ a V√≠ctor un sentido de prop√≥sito en la vida cuando obtuvo el puesto dos meses despu√©s.
¬†
Durante los 18 meses que fue guardia con Wells Fargo, Gerena era introvertido y no entablaba conversaci√≥n con sus compa√±eros de trabajo. V√≠ctor no ten√≠a amigos, y su tiempo libre lo pasaba viendo televisi√≥n en su apartamento con Ana Elizabeth "Liza" Soto, de 20 a√±os, con quien viv√≠a hac√≠a dos a√±os. Tres meses antes del robo, Gerena viaj√≥ a Puerto Rico por primera vez, y el machetero Eliseo "Gabino" Alejandro Ort√≠z, quien lo reclut√≥ en Hartford, lo llev√≥ a los lugares hist√≥ricos en la isla como la Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n en Lares y los centros ceremoniales ind√≠genas de Utuado y Barrio Tibes en Ponce. 
¬†
A las 9:40 p.m. del 12 de septiembre de 1983, mientras su jefe estaba en su escritorio revisando el inventario de la caja, Gerena se le acerc√≥ por la espalda, le quit√≥ el rev√≥lver con el que le apunt√≥ a la cabeza, agarr√°ndolo por el pelo con la otra mano. "No te muevas, que no estoy jugando", le dijo Gerena al otro guardia que trat√≥ de asistir al jefe, y procedi√≥ a amarrar a ambos e inyectarlos con algo para que durmieran, escapando con $7,007,151.98, que pesaba 1,150 libras, en un carro rentado. Gerena tuvo la asistencia de Filiberto Ojeda y Juan Segarra Palmer.
¬†
Las autoridades estiman que Gerena no sab√≠a que su destino era Cuba y que no pod√≠a llevar a su mujer, quien hab√≠a conseguido una licencia de matrimonio para casarse al d√≠a siguiente. El 27 de septiembre de 1983, Segarra manej√≥ una casa rodante Superior Motor Home de 1973 con paredes dobles, piso falso y un compartimiento cap√°z de ocultar a dos personas, trasladando a Gerena y dos millones de d√≥lares a la Embajada cubana en M√©xico. Ojeda, apodado "El G-2 cubano" por ser un agente de inteligencia de Cuba desde 1961, respond√≠a servilmente a los intereses de Fidel Castro. El veh√≠culo fue manejado por Juan Segarra, quien volvi√≥ a salir de M√©xico con la casa rodante el 12 de octubre de 1983, seg√∫n demuestran los records de Inmigraci√≥n. Ese d√≠a Segarra hizo una llamada con cargo revertido a su residencia desde un tel√©fono p√∫blico de la ciudad fronteriza de Laredo, Texas.
¬†
A las 7:43 de la noche del domingo 30 de octubre de 1983, los macheteros Luis Col√≥n Osorio, y los hermanos Orlando, Avelino y Norberto Gonz√°lez Claudio, dispararon un cohete antitanque LAW M-72 contra las oficinas del FBI en el quinto piso del edificio federal de Hato Rey, fallando el tiro 3 metros por debajo, haci√©ndole una peque√±a aver√≠a a una columna de concreto. El da√±o a la estructura fue tan insignificante, que nunca fue reparado. Una mujer Ilam√≥ a Prensa Asociada a nombre de los Macheteros y dijo que el ataque, denominado "La Guillotina," era en represalia por la invasi√≥n norteamericana de Granada.
¬†
El n√∫mero de serie del cohete disparado demostr√≥ que fue parte del armamento abandonado por el ej√©rcito norteamericano en Vietnam en 1975. "Esas armas se las dieron a ellos de Cuba", declar√≥ a la prensa el agente del FBI Angel Berlingeri en septiembre de 1985. El secretario de Estado George Schultz declar√≥ el 11 de noviembre de 1986 que la Uni√≥n Sovi√©tica y Cuba hab√≠an estado enviando esas armas a grupos subversivos en Am√©rica Latina. Los cohetes M-72 empleados en el fallido atentado contra el general Augusto Pinochet en Chile en septiembre de 1986 era parte de ese armamento.
¬†
El cohete contra las oficinas del FBI fue disparado desde la calle O'Neill. Dos testigos vieron a dos sujetos correr por esa calle en direcci√≥n Este, y en un momento de confusi√≥n atravesaron hacia la Ave. Roosevelt por un pasillo al lado de Radio Shack. Se supon√≠a que hubieran ido a un restaurante cercano, pero parece que no encontraron la entrada trasera. Las autoridades recuperaron los dos veh√≠culos de escape abandonados por los Macheteros a una milla de los hechos. Un testigo hab√≠a anotado la tablilla del Chevrolet Blazer 1976, donde el FBI ocup√≥ dentro de un compartimiento de la puerta un pedazo de un boleto de tr√°nsito rasgado. A trav√©s del n√∫mero de serie, localizaron la copia del original, que estaba a nombre de "Pedro Almodovar Rivera," cuya licencia de conducir conten√≠a la foto de Ojeda y su direcci√≥n en el 3384 Boulevard de Levitown. La √∫ltima vez que el FBI hab√≠a visto a Ojeda fue en 1976 cuando estuvo escondido un tiempo en la
 Misi√≥n Cubana ante las Naciones Unidas en Nueva York.
¬†
Ese mismo mes, el FBI efectu√≥ intervenciones electr√≥nicas dentro del apartamento de Ojeda, su tel√©fono, su autom√≥vil, y tres tel√©fonos p√∫blicos frente a su residencia, los cuales usaba con frecuencia, y de donde se levantaron las huellas digitales de Ojeda, que era vigilado las 24 horas con binoculares desde un apartamento a 40 yardas, adem√°s de una patrulla m√≥vil de seis carros con agentes. Poco despu√©s intervinieron electr√≥nicamente la guarida en la oficina 249 del Condominio El Centro, en Hato Rey, y las residencias del matrimonio Juan Segarra Palmer y Luz Mar√≠a Berr√≠os, y de Jorge Farinacci.
¬†
El 15 de enero de 1984, el FBI vi√≥ cuando Ojeda recogi√≥ a Ivonne Mel√©ndez Carri√≥n a varias cuadras de su casa, en Vega Baja, y la llev√≥ a su residencia en Levitown, donde ella visitaba casi diariamente, excepto los fines de semana. Desde 1981 Mel√©ndez era la dirigente de la c√©lula "Los Tainos," y el Comit√© Central de los Macheteros la encomend√≥ a escribir la reglamentaci√≥n del manual de combate de su grupo.
¬†
Al d√≠a siguiente, el FBI comenz√≥ a vigilar a El√≠as Samuel Castro Ramos, y as√≠ sucesivamente hasta tener a todos los Macheteros bajo observaci√≥n. El 29 de marzo de 1976, Castro Ramos, Edwin Mel√©ndez V√©1ez, Carmen Adela Acevedo Vicente y Luis Medina Hern√°ndez, todos del Partido Socialista Puertorrique√±o (PSP), fueron arrestados en una casa campestre, propiedad de Luis Lugo D√≠az, en el sector Mata de Platano en Luquillo con 1,357 libras de la iremita robada el 21 de julio de 1974 de la f√°brica Ireco Caribbean en Manat√≠.
¬†
El 22 de marzo de 1984, agentes federales siguieron a Ivonne Mel√©ndez Carri√≥n en un vuelo de Puerto Rico a la ciudad de Nueva York, donde la esperaban Isaac Camacho Negr√≥n y Orlando Gonz√°lez Claudio, que la llevaron en un Datsun hasta New Paltz, Nueva York, entrando en una casa rodante Superior Motor Home 1973. Los agentes del FBI los vigilaron hasta las dos de la madrugada, se retiraron por tres horas y media, y cuando volvieron no encontraron el veh√≠culo y sus ocupantes, sino pedazos de madera que le hab√≠an extraido para la remodelaci√≥n de los escondites que hab√≠a hecho Orlando Gonz√°lez Claudio, que es ebanista y carpintero. 
¬†
La casa rodante, con otros $3 millones del bot√≠n, cruz√≥ la frontera el 27 de marzo, y las autoridades mexicanas expidieron permisos de turismo a Camacho Negr√≥n y Gonz√°lez Claudio. D√≠as despu√©s, Ojeda y Segarra tomaron un vuelo de San Juan a Laredo, supuestamente entrando a M√©xico clandestinamente para reunirse con los funcionarios de la embajada cubana.
¬†

La tablilla de la casa rodante revel√≥ que fue comprada por "Juvenal Concepci√≥n" en Southborough, Massachusetts, cuatro d√≠as despu√©s del robo de los $7 millones, pagando con un cheque de gerente del Baybank/Harvard Trust en Cambridge Mass. El FBI localiz√≥ la copia de la licencia de conducir de "Juvenal Concepci√≥n," que ten√≠a una foto a colores de Filiberto Ojeda, quien tambi√©n fue identificado por los vendedores del veh√≠culo. El equipo fotogr√°fico del banco Baybank demostr√≥ que el cheque de gerente fue comprado por Juan Segarra Palmer con el seud√≥nimo "K. Fishman."
¬†
A las 3:30 de la tarde del 2 de abril de 1984, las autoridades allanaron un escondite de los Macheteros en Puerta de Tierra, ocupando cientos de documentos, con las huellas dactilares de Ojeda, Farinacci y Castro Ramos, entre otros, una relaci√≥n con los "nombres de guerra" de 141 Macheteros, y los comunicados originales cuyas copias hab√≠an emitido a la prensa a trav√©s de los a√±os. Tambi√©n confiscaron un listado computarizado con los nombres de todos los polic√≠as de Puerto Rico, con su n√∫mero de placa y seguro social, al igual que una relaci√≥n oficial de votantes del Precinto 1 de San Juan, y otro listado de 15,000 nombres de personas clasificadas como "amigo, enemigo, acercable", entre los que figuran pol√≠ticos, artistas y periodistas. Se ocup√≥ la n√≥mina de los Macheteros con la escala de sueldos a tiempo parcial y tiempo completo, cuyo sueldo b√°sico por persona era $400 mensuales; casado y la esposa no trabaja: $500; casado, con hijos y la
 esposa trabaja: $35 adicional por cada hijo; casado, con hijos y la esposa no trabaja: $60 adicional por cada hijo.
¬†
Otros documentos confiscados detallaban la organizaci√≥n del Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores Puertorrique√±os (PRTP), el brazo pol√≠tico de los Macheteros fundado en 1976, y los escalones del Ej√©rcito Popular Boricua, el brazo militar, que comienza con la unidad de combate, que consiste de cinco personas cuyo l√≠der es miembro de la secci√≥n pol√≠tica y controla el arsenal de su n√∫cleo. Tres unidades de combate (15 personas) forman una c√©lula de l√≠nea, que dirigen un jefe pol√≠tico y un jefe militar, en coordinaci√≥n con los tres l√≠deres de unidades. La c√©lula de l√≠nea (17 personas) recibe asistencia log√≠stica de una c√©lula de apoyo de cinco personas, que casi nunca entran en acci√≥n. Su labor es proveer carros robados, armas, equipo, escondites, asistencia m√©dica, etc., y el jefe de este grupo es miembro del Partido y pertenece a una formaci√≥n. Cada formaci√≥n contiene cinco c√©lulas, cuatro c√©lulas de l√≠nea (con 17 miembros cada
 una = 68 personas) y una de apoyo con otros cinco, que son un total de 73 personas dirigidas por un miembro del Partido. Una comisi√≥n militar planea las acciones terroristas. Tienen subcomisiones de inteligencia, entrenamiento, finanzas, transportaci√≥n y otros servicios. Por arriba de la comisi√≥n militar est√° el Comit√© Central, que formula la pol√≠tica de los Macheteros, y el Comit√© Directivo las efect√∫a.
¬†
El FBI anunci√≥ p√∫blicamente que en el local ocuparon mucha propaganda comunista, incluyendo ejemplares del bolet√≠n de escasa circulaci√≥n Pensamiento Cr√≠tico, nombre que tomaron de una publicaci√≥n de Cuba. Los editores del bolet√≠n, Jorge Farinacci, Miguel P√©rez Garc√≠a y Pedro J. Varela Fern√°ndez denunciaron al FBI en rueda de prensa por crear "una patra√±a" al vincularlos con los Macheteros. Sin embargo, en su edici√≥n de ese mes, Pensamiento Cr√≠tico hab√≠a publicado el programa del Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores Puertorrique√±os (PRTP), de los Macheteros.
¬†
El 12 de abril de 1984, el machetero Carlos "Puma" Rodr√≠guez Rodr√≠guez y su esposa Isabel Pa√±os Agull√≥ fueron declarados culpables de 14 cargos de robo bancario y posesi√≥n con intenci√≥n de distribuir sustancias controladas. Los abogados de Rodr√≠guez fueron el subversivo Juan R. Acevedo Cruz y el abogado laboral Pedro J. Varela Fern√°ndez, se√±alado por el FBI como miembro de los Macheteros con el seud√≥nimo "Manolo", quien declar√≥ en el San Juan Star del 20 de abril de 1984, p√°gina 2, que "Su cliente era v√≠ctima de una maquinaci√≥n de agentes del FBI que pudieron haber colocado la evidencia contra su cliente."
¬†
Ese mismo d√≠a, Rodr√≠guez abandon√≥ a su esposa y viol√≥ las condiciones de fianza al esfumarse. Le pidi√≥ a Alejandro "El Chivo" Mart√≠nez Vargas que lo llevara a ver al jefe machetero Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os. Hilton Fern√°ndez Diamante llev√≥ a Rodr√≠guez al apartamento de playa del m√©dico H√©ctor Pesquera en el d√©cimotercer piso del condominio Sandy Hill Tower en Luquillo, el cual los Macheteros usaban para reuniones clandestinas, igual que el apartamento del doctor Mercado en el piso doce del mismo edificio. All√≠ Farinacci aconsej√≥ a Rodr√≠guez que se fuera al clandestinaje y que los que hab√≠an prestado su fianza recibir√≠an un reembolso de los Macheteros. Se acord√≥ que una maquillista disfrazar√≠a a Rodr√≠guez de mujer para salir de Puerto Rico, pero el 18 de abril, temiendo que lo fueran a matar los Macheteros, escap√≥ del apartamento y se entreg√≥ al FBI ante las camaras del estudio del Canal 4 de televisi√≥n.
¬†
Rodr√≠guez se√±al√≥ a las autoridades federales a Avelino Gonz√°lez Claudio, Hilton Fern√°ndez Diamante, Jorge Farinacci Garc√≠a, Juan Antonio Castillo Ayala y Rub√©n Ramos Acosta, adem√°s de Ojeda y Mart√≠nez Vargas, como miembros de los Macheteros que lo ayudaron a esconderse, y que algunos de ellos usaban "beepers" para mantenerse en comunicaci√≥n.
¬†
Tras su rendici√≥n, el jefe tronquista Jos√© E. C√°diz Ayala describi√≥ a Rodr√≠guez para el San Juan Star del 18 de abril de 1984, p√°gina 10, como "un dedicado organizador de la Uni√≥n, quien participaba en todas las huelgas, y trabajaba noche tras noche en defensa de la causa laboral." Rodr√≠guez tambi√©n hab√≠a militado en el Partido Socialista Puertorrique√±o (PSP).
¬†
Varias semanas despu√©s, en una conversaci√≥n grabada mediante monitores colocados en la residencia de Filiberto Ojeda en Levitown, se escuch√≥ al jefe Machetero, una mujer y otros hombres, discutiendo sobre alguien que hab√≠a hu√≠do. "Lo ten√≠amos y escap√≥, y no se ha tenido un reporte todav√≠a. Nadie sabe lo que ha pasado, por qu√© huy√≥, o quien ha sido responsable de permitirle que escapara."
¬†
El 8 de junio de 1984, Isabel Pa√±os Agull√≥ fue sentenciada a 28 a√±os de presidio federal en el caso CR-83-153 por el juez Gilberto Gierbolini. Durante otra conversaci√≥n grabada por el FBI el 17 de junio de 1984, Ojeda y William Bird Forteza discutieron la situaci√≥n de Rodr√≠guez. Bird le pregunt√≥ a Ojeda si sab√≠a cuando ser√≠a la fecha de sentencia, y √©ste respondi√≥ que el "Puma" obtendr√≠a una larga condena y que "cantar√≠a como un pich√≥n". El 29 de junio, Rodr√≠guez fue condenado a 57 a√±os de presidio y una multa de $55,000. Cinco meses despu√©s, comenz√≥ a cooperar con el FBI, para que le anularan la multa y le rebajaran su sentence a 12 a√±os y la de su esposa a 10 a√±os.
¬†
El 7 de mayo de 1984, Ojeda, seguido por un agente del FBI, tom√≥ un vuelo a Nueva York con el nombre Julio L√≥pez. Tres d√≠as despu√©s, fue en una guagua Greyhound hasta Springfield, Massachusetts, donde lo esperaban Orlando Gonz√°lez Claudio y Angel D√≠az Ruiz, quien manej√≥ la casa rodante hasta un campo en Bellingham, en las afueras de Boston. Entre los desperdicios que botaron, el FBI recuper√≥ un boleto del estacionamiento del aeropuerto internacional de Houston, Texas. El d√≠a 11, los Macheteros fueron en el veh√≠culo hasta el Bradley Shopping Plaza en Dorchester, donde se reunieron con Segarra Palmer para decidir el destino de la casa rodante, la cual dejaron en un estacionamiento en Boston, donde posteriormente fue confiscada por el FBI. Ojeda y D√≠az Ruiz regresaron a Puerto Rico el 12 de mayo, y Gonz√°lez Claudio viaj√≥ a Nueva York.
¬†
Una conversaci√≥n telef√≥nica interceptada el 18 de mayo de 1984, entre el jefe machetero Filiberto Ojeda R√≠os e Ivonne Mel√©ndez Carri√≥n, por primera vez pone al FBI al tanto de una pugna entre los Macheteros, cuando Ojeda critica a Avelino Gonz√°lez Claudio, Hilton Fern√°ndez Diamante y Jorge Farinacci como "quemados" dentro de la organizaci√≥n, porque los $7 millones les abri√≥ un apetito burgu√©s consumidor y comenzaron a comprar carros nuevos, grabadoras de video y otros art√≠culos de lujo. Ojeda alardeaba que √©l era m√°s revolucionario que todos, ya que durante mas de 20 a√±os viv√≠a clandestinamente con todas sus pertenencias en una maleta, movi√©ndose constantemente, dedicado totalmente a la causa separatista. Los disidentes, quienes se hab√≠an estado reuniendo por lo menos tres veces por semana en un apartamento de Farinacci en el Condominio Los Frailes en Guaynabo

COME WITH US TO CUBA THIS SUMMER!
¬†
¬†

43rd Contingent¬† approximate dates:
July 8-22, 2012
The 43rd contingent of the VB will travel to Cuba in the summer of 2012. Although exact dates are to be determined, the trip wil be approximately 2 weeks during July. The tentative cost is about $1500. If you are interested in participating, please contact us.
¬†
________________________________
 
Introduction
In 1969, a coalition of young people formed the Venceremos ("We Shall Overcome") Brigade, as a means of showing solidarity with the Cuban Revolution by working side by side with Cuban workers and challenging U.S. policies towards Cuba, including the economic blockade and our government‚Äôs ban on travel to the island. The first Brigades participated in sugar harvests and subsequent Brigades have done agricultural and construction work in many parts of the island.
¬†
Over the last 39 years, the VB has given over 8,000 people from the U.S. the opportunity for a life-changing experience. While the trip has evolved over time, the Venceremos Brigade has always kept its format of work, educational activities, and travel. In addition, we remain committed to organizing the most diverse contingents possible; Brigadistas are young and older, of many races, nationalities, socio-economic classes, and sexual orientations. 
¬†
The oldest Cuba solidarity organization in the world, the VB has never requested permission from the U.S. government to go to Cuba‚Äìand we never will! We believe it is our right as U.S. citizens to travel free of U.S. government obstacles. We also believe that we have much to learn from Cuba and the best way to do that is to travel there and see for ourselves!

Puerto Rican Robbery Suspect Negotiating With Feds
By MICHAEL MELIA Associated Press
HARTFORD, Conn.¬†
April 24, 2012 (AP)
http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/puerto-rican-robbery-suspect-negotiating-feds-16198296#.T5XUcLPWatc

A graying Puerto Rican nationalist charged in a 1983 robbery in Connecticut is negotiating with prosecutors to try to resolve the case ahead of trial, his attorney said Monday.

The attorney for Norberto Gonzalez Claudio made the disclosure at a bond hearing in U.S. District Court in Hartford. Attorney Richard Reeve said his client could better consult with those close to him on his options if he were released from jail.

"I would report to the court there are ongoing negotiations," Reeve said.

The judge did not immediately rule on the request for bond, which is opposed by federal prosecutors who say Gonzalez is too dangerous to be released.

Wearing a beige prison jumpsuit and a bushy white goatee, Gonzalez smiled and winked at family members as he was led into the courtroom with his hands cuffed behind his back. He has been jailed at a Rhode Island prison since last May, when the FBI found him living under an assumed name in a small town in central Puerto Rico.

Gonzalez was one of the last two remaining fugitives in the 1983 robbery of $7 million from a Wells Fargo armored car depot in West Hartford, Conn. The crime was orchestrated by Los Macheteros, a group that claimed responsibility for robberies, murders and bombings in the 1970s and '80s in the name of Puerto Rican independence.

Gonzalez is not accused of participating directly in the heist, which was the largest cash robbery in U.S. history at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to federal charges including bank robbery, conspiracy and transportation of stolen money.

An older brother, Avelino Gonzalez Claudio, was arrested in 2008 in Puerto Rico and struck a deal with prosecutors. He is serving a seven-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to his role in the heist.

Thomas Carson, a spokesman for Connecticut's U.S. attorney, declined to comment on the status of any plea negotiations in the case of Norberto Gonzalez.

In the request for bond, Reeve said Gonzalez could be released into the custody of a son who lives in Stratford, Conn. He said Gonzalez has no interest in returning to life as a fugitive, and he would not jeopardize the financial situation of family members and supporters who are offering to put up equity in their homes to secure his bond.

Reeve also said Gonzalez would be more comfortable discussing options in his case if he were not confined in a prison where his conversations are recorded.

In opposition to the request, prosecutors said he was a leader of the militant independence group, lived as a fugitive for a quarter century and had three loaded guns by his bed when he was arrested.

The robbery was allegedly carried out by Victor Manuel Gerena, a Wells Fargo driver recruited by Los Macheteros, and authorities say other members of the group helped to smuggle the money out of the United States. Prosecutors have said they believe the money was used to finance bombings and attacks in their push for independence for the U.S. Caribbean territory.

Aging Puerto Rico Nationalist Too Dangerous For Bail, Prosecutors Say
Published April 19, 2012
Fox News Latino
http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/04/19/aging-puerto-rico-nationalist-too-dangerous-for-bail-prosecutors-say/

A 66-year-old Puerto Rican nationalist awaiting trial in a record-setting 1983 robbery is too dangerous to be released on bond, federal prosecutors said Thursday.¬†

Norberto Gonzalez Claudio kept three loaded guns by his bed, prosecutors said. When he was arrested last year, authorities said they found a detailed bomb-making manual in his residence.

Gonzalez was a leader in Los Macheteros--translated as both the "Machete Wielders" and the "Cane Cutters"--a nationalist group known for carrying out violent acts in the name of Puerto Rican independence. He was arrested in May and is currently awaiting trial on charges of helping coordinate a $7 million robbery of a Wells Fargo car depot in Connecticut in 1983 -- the biggest cash robbery in U.S. history at the time.

Gonzalez had asked to be released, saying his detention conditions are restricting his communication as he considers his defense strategy. His attorney said in court papers he has no criminal record and is a "gentle, loving man."

He has pleaded not guilty to federal charges including bank robbery, conspiracy and transportation of stolen money.

Prosecutors acknowledge Gonzalez is not accused of having participated directly in the robbery. But they said that was true of 18 of the 19 defendants charged in the case, yet several other defendants were detained pending trial based on dangerousness.

Los Macheteros carried out a series of violent acts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including a 1979 attack on a bus carrying U.S. sailors that killed two and wounded 10, a 1981 attack on Puerto Rico's Air National Guard base and the 1983 and 1985 launches of anti-tank missiles at the San Juan federal court building, prosecutors said. Gonzalez was an active member of the group at the time the sailors were killed and was a member of the leadership committee at the time of the other violent acts, prosecutors said.

Authorities say a document shows Gonzalez discussed the need to have members with revolutionary experience and that a typewriter seized from his residence in 1985 was used to generate publicity notices in which Los Macheteros claimed credit for the Wells Fargo robbery and rocket attacks.

"In sum, there is clear and convincing evidence that the defendant's release on bond presents a danger to the community," prosecutors wrote.

Prosecutors also said there was "overwhelming evidence" that Gonzalez was a flight risk, saying he remained a fugitive for 25 years and evaded arrest by living under a false identity. They say he faces a sentence of up to 265 years in prison, so he has an incentive to flee.

Gonzalez said in documents filed Sunday that he would honor a promise to appear for trial. His attorneys named eight people in Puerto Rico who are willing to co-sign a bond and said Gonzalez has a son in Stratford, willing to act as his father's custodian.

"He understands fully that a willful failure to appear would result in very serious consequences to his family, and he will not allow that to happen," his attorneys wrote.

But prosecutors said the robbery proceeds were never recovered and the co-signers' pledged equity could be made up from less than one-sixteenth of the missing robbery proceeds if Gonzalez fled.

While Gonzalez promised to appear in court, prosecutors said Los Macheteros denies the legitimacy of the U.S. federal court system.

Gonzalez has been detained at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island, where he complained last year about treatment by "imperialist abusers." He says his time outside his cell has been severely restricted and he has not been allowed to meet in-person with visiting relatives.
Prosecutors say Gonzalez's security classification in prison was based on his membership in a violent group and that the situation has improved. They say many defendants have been held without bond in complex cases.

The Associated Press left a message for Gonzalez's attorneys.

Gonzalez's brother, Avelino Gonzalez Claudio, is serving a seven-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2010 to his role in the heist.

The robbery was allegedly carried out by Victor Manuel Gerena, a Wells Fargo driver recruited by Los Macheteros, and authorities say other members of the group helped to smuggle the money out of the United States. Prosecutors have said they believe the money was used to finance bombings and attacks in their push for independence for the U.S. Caribbean territory.

Federal agents arrested Gonzalez in the Puerto Rican town of Cayey in May, after he had spent a quarter-century on the lam. Authorities believe he spent that time hiding out in the¬†

The Puerto Rican Political Prisoners (left to right): 
Oscar Lopez Rivera, Avelino Gonzalez Claudio, and Norberto Gonzalez Claudio

¬†
Dear Supporter,
¬†
New ProLibertad t-shirts...new protest banners...new campaign posters...as we begin this holiday season, we are thinking about how we can broaden the movement to free our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners in the new year!
With every new year comes a sense of much possibility. We are sure this coming year will be a powerful and decisive time for our work to free Oscar Lopez Rivera, Avelino Gonzalez Claudio and Norberto Gonzalez Claudio; we are beginning to do all of the necessary planning to make this happen. 
¬†
With that in mind, we are launching the ‚ÄúFriends of ProLibertad‚Äù initiative. The ‚ÄúFriends of ProLibertad‚Äù is a network of supporters that will help us reach our goal of $5000 for 2012. A minimum donation of $25 from our supporters will help us purchase a new campaign banner for protests and activities; print new high gloss brochures for distribution; re-launch a professional website; make an updated campaign t-shirt; and cover the costs of the venues we use for public activities.
For 17 years, ProLibertad has worked diligently to build the movement to free the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners with the support of our contributors. As we enter this holiday season and new year, we have high hopes of modernizing our outreach tools, creating new fund-raising opportunities and creating a network of support that will help us reach that inevitable day when Oscar, Avelino and Norberto walk free in their homeland, Puerto Rico.
¬†
Your support means so much; it helps us make freedom happen. Your support will reunite Oscar, Avelino and Norberto with their families and friends. These Prisoners of Colonialism have suffered enough and it is time for them to come home!. They should not have to spend any more holidays and New Year‚Äôs Days behind the prison walls of this empire.
¬†
Thank you in advance for your donation. We look forward to sending you regular updates on our work and seeing you at our activities in 2012.

The Venceremos Brigade
JOIN THE 43rd Contingent: July 8-22, 2012
¬†
The 43rd contingent of the VB will travel to Cuba in the summer of 2012. The tentative cost is about $1500. If you are interested in participating, please contact us.
¬†
Who is the Venceremos Brigade?
In 1969, a coalition of young people formed the Venceremos ("We Shall Overcome") Brigade, as a means of showing solidarity with the Cuban Revolution by working side by side with Cuban workers and challenging U.S. policies towards Cuba, including the economic blockade and our government‚Äôs ban on travel to the island. The first Brigades participated in sugar harvests and subsequent Brigades have done agricultural and construction work in many parts of the island.¬†
Over the last¬†43 years, the VB has given over 8,000 people from the U.S. the opportunity for a life-changing experience. While the trip has evolved over time, the Venceremos Brigade has always kept its format of work, educational activities, and travel. In addition, we remain committed to organizing the most diverse contingents possible; Brigadistas are young and older, of many races, nationalities, socio-economic classes, and sexual orientations. 
¬†
The oldest Cuba solidarity organization in the world, the VB has never requested permission from the U.S. government to go to Cuba‚Äìand we never will! We believe it is our right as U.S. citizens to travel free of U.S. government obstacles. We also believe that we have much to learn from Cuba and the best way to do that is to travel there and see for ourselves!

Marxist terrorists Douglas Wright, Brandon Baxter, Anthony Hayne, Connor Stevens and Joshua Stafford falsely posing as "anarchists" get Brown Cards from IAT and are thus expulsed from the anarchist movement. FBI arrested the five self-described "anarchists" in the Cleveland area (Ohio/USA) for allegedly plotting to blow up a four-lane highway bridge over a national park. The group is anti-capitalist, i.e. socialist, and terrorist ochlarchist, and thus authoritarian  - and authoritarian socialists are marxists not anarchists. Violent attacks on (symbols of) capitalism and/or the (capitalist - according to marxism) state/government are marxist, similar to the marxist-leninist terrorist organizations the Italian Red Brigades (BR) and German RAF (Baader Meinhof), etc. FBI, Reuters and Jeremy Pelosky, Kim Palmer, Bill Trott and Jackie Frank get Brown Cards from IAT for falsely calling the marxist ochlarchists "anarchists" and thus breaking the Oslo Convention. 

 

BROWN CARDS 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TERRORIST OCHLARCHISTS - NOT ANARCHISTS - OF OUR TIME
FC 55 TERRORISM - ITALIAN TERRORISM - ETC - BROWN CARDS, INCLUDING TO EUROPOL
BROWN CARDS TO THE UNABOMBER, PRIMITIVISTS, ITALIAN TERRORISTS, ETC.

A "litmus test" of whether marxists, fascists, anarchists or liberalists are behind terrorism

1. Terrorism is extremist, ultra-authoritarian acts, de facto very much a top down approach, se notes on extremism and anarchy at IAT-APT International Branch. Extremism is either marxist, fascist or liberalist, practically certain not anarchist, because an anarchist acting ultra-authoritarian/extremist stops to be an anarchist, and will be expulsed from the anarchist movement. All terrorists falsely called anarchists historically are expulsed from the anarchist movement post mortem, because they were not real anarchists. And all terrorists falsely called anarchists, of our time, are in general also expulsed from the anarchist movement via Brown Cards by IAT-APT. NB! Terrorists are thus not anarchists! The only violence anarchists accept is defensive violence, proportionate, in self defense, a bottom up approach, and that excludes terrorism, a top down approach. 

To be an anarchist or not is per definition dependent on what you do, not what you say you are or flag or be called by the newsmedia or others. It is not the outspoken aim - agenda, if any, that counts. The real aim is the consequences of the use of the means involved, not some ideological manifesto with good intentions, if any. Anarchists actions are actions that in consequence move (or keep) the social organization in horizontal direction, and that excludes terrorism because this is actions that in consequence have a top down approach, vertical organization. 

2. Terrorist actions are extremist/ultra-authoritarian and if capitalist/economical plutarchist, typically profit-motivated, the action is either fascist or liberalist, not anarchist or marxist. Ultra-authoritarian fascists in consequence also act for a "strong man", extremist liberalists not. Fascist terrorists often also have nationalist motives. Liberalist and fascist terrorism are rightwing extremism (with the rare exception of left-fascist/populist/nazi etc. terrorism which is a form of leftwing extremism). 

3. If extremist acts are anti-capitalist, they are socialist, and thus ultra-authoritarian socialism, i.e. a form of marxism, not liberalist or fascist, and not anarchist. What is a hallmark of marxist  extremism? Violent attacks on symbols of capitalism and/or the (capitalist - according to marxism) state is a marxist strategy of vanguardism, similar to the marxist-leninist terrorist organizations the Italian Red Brigades (BR) and German RAF (Baader Meinhof), etc. Anarchists see extremist symbolic actions on capitalism and statism as futile vis-a-vis changing the social organization in horizontal direction - the anarchist aim and strategy, and thus such actions are practically certain not done by anarchists, see also 1 and 2. So if there are extremist attacks on symbols of capitalism and state, it is marxist leftwing extremists, not anarchists behind. Thus terrorism that attacks symbols of capitalism and state, are done by marxist extremists, leftwingers, and not anarchists. 

4. Using this "litmus test", 1-3 we find that most terrorism world wide is done by marxist, leftwing, extremists, or rightwing extremists, practically certain never anarchists. In the future the people, police, authorities and newsmedia should use this "litmus test" when reporting about who is behind terrorism. 

5. To mix up opposites as anarchists with terrorists, a form of ochlarchists, is equally authoritarian as mixing up opposites as peace and war, as Big Brother did in Orwell's "1984" newspeak. Ochlarchists and anarchists are opposites. Such Big Brother notes in the media also produce copycat ochlarchists and terrorists - mainly mislead youths, falsely posing as "anarchists". It should be stopped, and the IAT-APT hands out Brown Cards, as free criticism of this authoritarian tendency - according to the Oslo Convention, - to newsmedia and others that are spreading such disinformation. 

6. In addition to 1.-5. only a few facts are necessary to find out whether marxists, fascists, anarchists or liberalists are behind terrorism. And terrorists are practically certain not anarchists!

The provocateur club "FC 55", "Freedom Club - 55", called Unabomber by FBI, has notoriously been mixing up anarchy etc., with chaos, terrorism and similar authoritarian tendencies, since the new nazi wave started in the seventies. The Unabomber (Theodore Kaczynski) is a psychopathic killer and FC 55 also is a +3 code for IF 88, i.e. International Fascists, Hail Hitler, as in Zorn 88. 

The typical fascist tactic of creating chaos (ochlarchy = mob rule broadly defined), falsely naming it "anarchy", i.e. "libertarian" or "freiheitliches" etc., and (later) call for the "strong man" and a totalitarian arch/archy, to do away with the "anarchy", is internationally well known. This will however practically certain only result in another form of ochlarchy and no real law and order for the people seen as a class opposed to the superiors, i.e. archs, in private and public sector, economically and/or political/administrative, i.e. in income and/or rank. Other ultra-authoritarian groups of marxist and liberalist origin have often similar tactics. This tactic is just an extension of the very frequent Orwellian "1984" Big Brother type newspeak calling ochlarchy falsely "anarchy" to support archy in general, i.e. x-archy, where x can be anything but not 'an'; in itself an ultra-authoritarian tendency of newsmedia, etc, mentioned in the Oslo Convention. Anarchy is however not ochlarchy, but real democracy. 

Among other cases, in Norway the DKP, promoting "anarchy" with fascist methods, and Frp may be mentioned; in Germany FAP, RAF (Baader Meinhof); Greece the MK & Enraged Wolves; Autonomous Cells of Rebel Action, Anarchist Liberation Brigade, Overthrow Anarchist Faction, May 15, Brass Knuckle Anarchist Punks, Anarchist Group of Virona, Last Generation, Anarchist Faction, Uncontrolled Rage, Children of Fire, Anti-Establishment Nucleus, Anarchist Struggle, Anarchists' Attack Group (AAG), Burning Path (Flegomeno Monopati), Anarchist Street Patrol, 21 June, Anti-Statist Justice (Antistatlig r‰ttvisa); France The Group Bakounine Gdansk Paris Guatemala Salvador (GBGPSG), Action Directe International (ADi), Action Directe; Italy Sardinian Autonomy Movement (MAS), Solidarieta Internazionale, Sinistra Ante Parlamentare, Informal Anarchist Federation (Federazione Anarchia Informale a.k.a. Federazione Anarchica Informale), Fronte Rivoluzionario del Comunismo (FRC), Cooperative of Hand-Made Fire and Related Items (Cooperativa Artigiana Fuoco e Affini), Proletarian Nuclei for Communism (Nuclei Proletari per Comunismo - NPC), The Five C's, Brigata XX Luglio, Brigata Arrabbiata, Red Brigades (Brigate Rosse); Spain Los Anarquistas and similar groups; Austria - Freiheitliches Partei of J¸rg Haider; Sweden the "olympian bomber" and Frihetsfronten, sometimes called "anarcho"-capitalists i.e. extreme free marketers. ["Anarcho"-capitalism, i.e. anarcho-plutarchy, a contradiction]."Insurrectional anarchism", i.e. terrorism; "Anarcho"-nationalists, i.e. neonazis, at Internet; USA John Zerzan, Derrick Jensen, Daniel Quinn, and ELF - primitivism and neo-ludditism; Anarho-sindikalisticka inicijativa et. al. from the ex-Yugoslavian region, a.s.o. These things are occurring several places in Europe, USA, etc. 

NB! All of these and similar groups and their followers have got expulsing Brown Cards from IAT-APT and are thus not members of the anarchist movement. Also, they are not networkmembers of the Anarchist International. However, as anyone; marxists, fascists, liberalists as well as anarchists, may be a subscriber to the IJA-newsletters, a few of them may perhaps be subscribers. All of these and similar groups and their followers are terrorists or potential terrorists, extremists and provocateurs, and thus not anarchists. 

Brown terror, sometimes with a dash of red or blue (or green), is neither "freiheitliches" nor "anarchistisch". "Anarchist" ideals or aims, combined with authoritarian methods, are marxism, fascism or liberalism on the economic-political map, and are thus not anarchism or anarchist. Even Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot, had vague "anarchist" or "classless" ideals - like a "pie in the sky", but they were not libertarian or anarchists. The fight against fascism starts with the fight against marxism. Anti-capitalist ochlarchists/ochlarchs are as mentioned authoritarian socialists, i.e. marxists. 

Especially John Zerzan, Derrick Jensen, Daniel Quinn, and ELF - primitivism and neo-ludditism; i.e. brown fascistoid "green" policy, strategy and tactics, has nothing to do with anarchism. Say, a "primitivist" and/or or "anti-civilization" society can only feed a few million people on earth, the others, billions, will die from this policy, thus it is worse than Hitler and Stalin, not to mention the terrorist strategy and tactics, i.e. clearly non-anarchist. So called "anarchist"-primitivism, in reality ochlarchist-primitivism, is a fascistoid "green" political tendency, far from anarchy and anarchism. 

It is as mentioned not the outspoken aim, the agenda, that counts. The real aim is the consequences of the use of the means involved, not some ideological manifesto with good intentions. Aims in ideological manifestos may be "anti-capitalist", "anti-imperialist", "anti-globalization", "anti-statist", "antifascist", "antipower", "antihierarchy", "antiauthoritarian", "anti-government", "anarchist" and similar with good intentions, but this is not relevant. A typically fascistoid statement used by ochlarchist, terrorist, infiltrators falsely posing as "anarchists" is: "All those attacks which are carefully directed towards the structures of power, administration of USA, EU and NATO, as well as on the other hierarchic and authoritative structures within the society, under the presumption of wide support, can only be treated by definition of legitimate anti-fascists resistance." This authoritarian statement gives a false "legitimation" of terrorism, i.e. authoritarian means and methods. The real aims are as mentioned always the consequences of the means that are used, and nothing else. 

A few pounds of dynamite will never change the powerstructure, as Kropotkin stated. Neither will some dozens of Molotov coctails. Terrorism is an unfruitful departure from anarchism, not a part of it. Anarchism means anarchist, i.e. non-authoritarian means and methods, as well as anarchist ends and aims. History and all relevant science, i.e. excluding materialistic and other dialectics, New Age, and similar quasi-science, demonstrate it is not possible to reach anarchist ends with authoritarian means. In general if the means involved are creating chaos/ochlarchy, i.e. mob rule broadly defined, it is promoting fascism or other dictatorship, totalitarian systems, calls for a "strong man", or other authoritarian systems, and not anarchism, i.e. real democracy. See also ANARCHISM VS OCHLARCHY (MOB RULE) IN GENOA - BROWN CARD TO BERLUSCONI, ETC, below for more information in this connection.

The statements and manifesto of the provocateur(s) FC 55, say, defending Manuel Noriega, promoting "anarchist power" - a contradiction; reactionary, i.e. brown "environmentalism", neo-ludditism, etc., [as well as the statements of his later supporter John Zerzan, another brown environmentalist (primitivism)], are just some authoritarian nonsense, made up to promote chaos, and put the blame on anarchists/anarchism. To bow for this tyrant (arch) and print such nonsense, as the newspapers N.Y. Times and Washington Post have done initiated by the FBI; it just promotes more of the same, as well as international contempt! 

As 

a) the US"counter terrorist expert" Yonah Alexander at CNN 27.7.1996 still promotes the Unabomber as "anarchist", and 

b) 7.8.1996 Helle Hoyness (Dagbladet), Arve Henriksen (Aft.p. Aften), and "Radio- og TV-nyheter" (Arbeiderbladet), call such a manifesto "anarchist", commenting NRK's program about the Unabomber 21.00 - 7.8.1996 (a program which however did not mention anarchist and anarchism at all), 

- they may share this Brown Card together with the responsible at Washington Post, N.Y. Times, FBI and the FC 55, released 20.9.1995, and updated several times. The international anarchist movement denounces these authoritarian doings, and of course doesn't accept the use of the word anarchist in this connection, which is disinformation. The Anarchist Press Tribunal issues the Brown Card as a symbol of free criticism, to notoriously authoritarian reporters, spokespersons and other persons, authors, writers, editors, etc., mixing up anarchist and chaotic/ochlarchical tendencies as mentioned above, and thus breaking the Oslo-convention of 1990 severely or several times...

Brown Cards as indicated above in general also go to all the persons and organizations mentioned above, and to the media and others calling them anarchists and their authoritarian ideology anarchist, anarchism or anarchy. They will bring, or brought about, nothing but authoritarian tendencies and systems, far from anarchy or anarchist. As mentioned all the so called "anarchist" organizations have got Brown Cards for mixing up anarchist with chaotic and other authoritarian tendencies, in short ochlarchy and ochlarchist, according to the Oslo Convention of 1990, and are thus expelled, expulsed and banned from the anarchist movement. Similar cases in the future will be treated the same way by IAT-APT. 

06.08.2011.Wikipedia, a mockery of a "free encyclopedia" and in reality quite authoritarian, is uncritical echoing the main newsmedia's "1984" newspeak lies about the Unabomber (Ted Kaczinsky) as "anarchist", and gets a Brown Card. Wikipedia has turned out to be one of the main authoritarian enemies of anarchy and anarchism, also presenting a lot of "1984" newspeak lies in this connection, a.o.t. falsely calling the ochlarchy with rivaling polyarchy of Somalia "anarchy".

A special a Brown Card goes to TKB-ORG  Terrorism Knowledge Base, and MIPT (The National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism) for several times wrongly mixing up anarchists with chaos, ochlarchy and terrorists. 

Another special Brown Card goes to the speculative "Anarchos fˆrlag" in Sweden, i.e. ochlarchists falsely posing as anarchists, which is publishing the brown, "environmentalist" ideas of John Zerzan, falsely promoted as "anarchist" but in reality ochlarchist, see above, and thus not anarchist. It must also be mentioned that GAIA's Eco-Anarchist-Manifesto, see EAM , is clearly against primitivism, neo-ludditism and anti-civilization in all forms, especially the terrorist and in general ochlarchical policy of John Zerzan, because this is a non-anarchist political tendency. John Zerzan is clearly an ochlarchist, and thus not an anarchist, and has got the Brown Card from IAT-APT, and is thus expulsed from the anarchist movement. 

The leader for a terrorist act, called the Oklahoma-bomber, was however not named anarchist or libertarian, but "anti-government", in this case a brown & blue conservative fundamentalist. The Oklahoma City bombing in the US in 1995 was done largely by a single person (Timothy McVeigh). The Atlanta city bombing 27.7.1996 was a similar act of terrorism.

07.02.2010. Fareed Zakaria at the program GPS at CNN speaks about an "anarchist" that was a terrorist. The IAT-APT hands out Brown Cards to Fareed Zakaria and CNN for breaking the Oslo Convention.

01.05.2012. Marxist terrorists Douglas Wright, Brandon Baxter, Anthony Hayne, Connor Stevens and Joshua Stafford falsely posing as "anarchists" get Brown Cards from IAT and are thus expulsed from the anarchist movement. FBI arrested the five self-described "anarchists" in the Cleveland area (Ohio/USA) for allegedly plotting to blow up a four-lane highway bridge over a national park. The group is anti-capitalist, i.e. socialist, and terrorist ochlarchist, and thus authoritarian  - and authoritarian socialists are marxists not anarchists. Violent attacks on (symbols of) capitalism and/or the (capitalist - according to marxism) state/government are marxist, similar to the marxist-leninist terrorist organizations the Italian Red Brigades (BR) and German RAF (Baader Meinhof), etc. FBI, Reuters and Jeremy Pelosky, Kim Palmer, Bill Trott and Jackie Frank get Brown Cards from IAT for falsely calling the marxist ochlarchists "anarchists" and thus breaking the Oslo Convention. 

24.05.2003 No anarchistgroup behind bomb blast in Spain! This act of terrorism is done by ochlarchists, not anarchists. The IAT gives a Brown Card to this group of terroristical ochlarchists and the newsmedia spreading disinformation, mixing them up with anarchists. The Brown Cards of course also means expulsion of the terrorist infiltrators, posing as anarchists, from the anarchist movement. 01.04.2004 No anarchists behind letterbombs in Spain. This act of terrorism is done by ochlarchists, not anarchists. The IAT gives a Brown Card to these terroristical ochlarchists and the newsmedia, including Euronews, spreading disinformation, mixing them up with anarchists. The Brown Cards of course also mean expulsion of the terrorist infiltrators, posing as anarchists, from the anarchist movement.

The IAT-APT hands out a Brown Card to BBC's Dateline London 02.08.2009 with editor Nick Guthrie for reporting about "anarchic" in connection to ETA and Taleban. ETA and Taleban are in no way anarchic, terrorism is very authoritarian, a top - down approach, and they are polyarchically organized, far from anarchist. Thus ETA and Taleban are clearly ochlarchists, the opposite of anarchists! 

No anarchists behind bombs against Romano Prodi and the European Parliament etc. 

So called "anarchists" have been suspected of putting up bombs to hit Romano Prodi in Italy in December 2003, and a letter bomb explodes at the office of a British MEP hours after another parcel ignites at European Parliament HQ 05.01.2004. These so called "anarchists" ("Informal Anarchic Federation" and "Sardinian Anarcho-Insurrectionalist Gang") are however not anarchists, but ochlarchist infiltrators to the anarchist movement (ochlarchy = mob rule broadly defined). The ochlarchists may very well be on the payroll of Berlusconi & Co, as they have put up false "anarchists" before, i.e. police provokers. Anyway the ochlarchists are not anarchists because ochlarchism and anarchism are opposite political tendencies. BBC and other media 28.12.2003 and 05.01.2004, and The Guardian 04.02. 2004 wrongly putting the blame on (suspected) anarchists instead of ochlarchists, get a Brown Card for breaking the Oslo Convention in this matter. The so called  "Informal Anarchic Federation" and the "Sardinian Anarcho-Insurrectionalist Gang" get an expelling Brown Card from the IAT. These "anarchist federations" have nothing to do with the real anarchist movement and are not members or associates of it. The Anarchist International works against the supranational EU-mega State, an EU-super-state, but of course with democratic means, not terrorism. Terrorism is a form of ochlarchy, and anarchy and ochlarchy are opposite things.

18.08.2004: ... Local reports say a second device was also was found in the Porto Rotundo area, on the Sardinian coast, after a newspaper received a tip-off. Italian news agency Ansa said the caller claimed to be from the leftist Proletarian Combatant Groups (NPC). Mr Blair and his wife Cherie left Sardinia on Tuesday after a short stay. Italy has been on heightened security alert after a general terror threat from a group linked to al-Qaeda. The group had threatened to attack Italy if it failed to withdraw its troops from Iraq. But this bomb was said to have been left by an Italian anarchist organization which the national Corriere della Sera newspaper says has carried out 20 attacks in the last four years, including small bombings of government party headquarters in Sardinia. This group is not anarchist but ochlarchist terrorists, and gets a Brown Card with expulsion from the anarchist movement.  

Marxist extremists behind terrorist attack in Rome a.o.t. against the embassy of the Anarchy of Switzerland. 
Brown Cards to Barbie Nadeau, Newsweek Magazine, Dan Rivers and CNN and more for falsely putting the blame on anarchists. Stop the lies! 
Also Brown Cards to the Italian Police, Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maron, and the state-run ANSA news agency.
The terrorism in Italy 23.12.2010 is done by the marxist leftwing extremist ochlarchy group "Informal Federation of Anarchists", i.e. 
provocateurs falsely posing as 'anarchists', which long time ago got a Brown Card from IAT-APT and are 
thus expulsed from the anarchist movement. They are thus NOT anarchists! 
Proof and more information above and below in this resolution: 

Bombs exploded at two embassies in Rome Thursday 23.12.2010, Italian police said. The first explosion, a package bomb at the Swiss Embassy, seriously wounded the person who opened it, police said. A second bomb exploded at the Chilean Embassy shortly afterwards, wounding one person, who has been taken to the hospital, police said. And a "suspicious package" was found at the Ukrainian Embassy in the Italian capital, police said, adding that security forces were on the way to investigate. Bomb threats were phoned to City Hall and to another government office in Rome, the mayor's office said. No bombs have been found in either location. One person was wounded and a second bomb exploded in the courtyard of the Swiss Embassy in Greece, but most of the other bombs were destroyed safely by police. In Thursday's attacks, a 53-year-old mail room worker in the Swiss Embassy was badly injured in both hands, and may lose one, police said.

The bombings come a day after police blanketed Rome in heavy security due to student demonstrations. Last month, at least 14 parcel bombs were sent out from Athens, Greece, mostly to embassies in that city. Behind the terrorism was the marxist leftwing extremist group Conspiracy of Cells of Fire, no anarchists were involved. This terrorist attack in Italy is practically certain done by a similar marxist group. 

The anarchists condemn the terrorist attack. A.o.t. using the "litmus test" of whether marxists, fascists, anarchists or liberalists are behind terrorism, it is practically certain that marxist leftwing extremists are behind this terrorist attack in Rome against the embassy of the Anarchy of Switzerland and more. Why should anarchists attack the embassy of the Anarchy of Switzerland? Barbie Nadeau, Newsweek Magazine and CNN's false accusations that anarchists are behind this terrorism are absurd! And Barbie Nadeau's lie about so called anarchists in Swiss prison on hunger strike is horrible. There are no anarchist political prisoners in Europe at all, and certainly not in the Swiss Confederation. The IAT-APT hands out Brown Cards to Barbie Nadeau, Newsweek Magazine and CNN for falsely putting the blame of this terrorism on anarchists (and the other lie), and thus breaking the Oslo Convention. Dan Rivers at CNN's London office falsely calls the marxist leftwing extremist group Conspiracy of Cells of Fire 'anarchist' and also gets a Brown Card. Stop the lies! 

PS. Later the Orwellian ultra-authoritarian Big Sister Barbie Nadeau continues with more lies on CNN, this time about "an international anarchist terrorist" organization behind the terrorism in Italy. There exists no such thing as "an international anarchist terrorist organization", and IAT-APT hands out another Brown Card to Barbie Nadeau and also one more to CNN, for this horrible lie! Stop the lies! Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said the incident is similar to a wave of letter bombs sent last month by an anarchist group based in Greece, linking both sets of bombings to an "international anarchist movement." But Greek officials disputed that anyone in their country was involved in the blasts. "There is no evidence that the bombs originated in Greece," Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras said. Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maron gets a Brown Card from IAT-APT, similar to Barbie Nadeu and Dan Rivers.

NB! International marxist leftwing extremist terrorism - not anarchists. There may however be connections between a) the marxist leftwing extremist terrorist group Conspiracy of Cells of Fire and other similar groups in Greece, see Greek revolt - marxist riots and terrorism, and b) marxist leftwing extremist terrorist groups in Italy - or such copy-cats! But they are NOT ANARCHISTS!!! (There are some marxist ochlarchists included terrorists in Italy, Spain and Greece, some falsely posing as 'anarchists', in jail and outside, that are angry at Switzerland, Chile, etc... But they are NOT ANARCHISTS! Anarchists and ochlarchists are opposites!)

PPS. Even later: The Orwellian ultra-authoritarian Big Sister Barbie Nadeau repeats the lies of Europol on CNN, se below. These lies are NOT NEWS and rebuffed long time ago!!! Stop the lies! 

PPPS. CNN continues the false reporting that this terrorism is linked to "international anarchists". Repeating a lie several times does not make it a truth, remember Goebbels did not win in the long run! Stop the lies! 

The Italian police said that the Informal Federation of Anarchists [a.k.a. Informal Anarchist Federation and Informal Anarchic Federation; in Italian Federazione Anarchica Informale (FAI) and Federazione Anarchia Informale (FAI)] claimed responsibility for the attacks, according to the state-run ANSA news agency. The Informal Federation of Anarchists is however a well known ultra-authoritarian marxist group, and they ar far from anarchists. Thus, the IAT-APT hands out Brown Cards to the Italian police and the state-run ANSA news agency for breaking the Oslo Convention. CNN and the Italian police indicate that the Informal Federation of Anarchists is an associate or member of the L'International des Federations Anarchistes (IFA), this is also a lie, see the official website of IFA www.anarchy.no. 

The marxist provocateurs, the "Informal Federation of Anarchists", is vowing in messages that it plans more such acts to "destroy the systems of domination," the state-run ANSA news agency reports. Terrorism is however a form of domination and it will never "destroy the systems of domination"... 

Several other newsmedia including BBC falsely put the blame of this terrorism on anarchists, and get Brown Cards according to the Oslo Convention.

PPPPS. The truth 1. De facto marxist leftwing extremist terrorists, provocateurs falsely posing as 'anarchists', such as the Italian "FAI (Federazione Anarchica Informale)" and similar are not anarchists. Stop the lies! This group and their network are long time ago expulsed from the anarchist movement. The Italian "FAI (Federazione Anarchica Informale)" has long time ago got a Brown Card from IAT-APT meaning this group is expelled from the anarchist movement. They are thus NOT ANARCHISTS. The same with similar groups in Greece and Spain. And there are no anarchists in prisons in Italy, not in the Anarchy of Switzerland, not in Greece and not in Spain, and thus of course no jailed anarchists on hunger strike in any these countries. The Orwellian ultra-authoritarian Big Sister Barbie Nadeau repeats her newspeak lies on CNN and more of it, similar to "peace is war". Stop the Orwellian Big Brother and Big Sister newspeak lies! 

The truth 2. Terrorism is a form of ochlarchy - the opposite of anarchy and anarchism; and terrorists are ochlarchists - the opposite of anarchists. To Big Sister Barbie Nadeau and more... Newsmedia = Big Brothers! Stop the lies 'anarchy' = ochlarchy and 'anarchist(s)' = ochlarchist(s), even if it is political 'sexy' and sells well... It is Orwellian '1984' Big Brother newspeak and fabricated propaganda! See this resolution in the Preamble to this page IAT-APT International Branch. 

The truth 3. Apropos this terrorism and news-reporting, see PREAMBLE - THREE VERY IMPORTANT RESOLUTIONS: Anarchy is optimal order... & Newsmedia = Big Brothers! Stop the lies... & What is an extremist... at the IAT-APT International Branch. Apropos these resolutions, decided with general consent, by The International Anarchist Congress - The 11th Anarchist Biennial 27-28.11.2010: MORE THAN 50 000 ANARCHISTS WORLD WIDE CONFIRM THAT OCHLARCHISTS, INCLUDING TERRORISTS - ARE PRACTICALLY CERTAIN NOT ANARCHISTS! THUS: The Informal Federation of Anarchists [a.k.a. Informal Anarchist Federation and Informal Anarchic Federation; in Italian Federazione Anarchica Informale (FAI) and Federazione Anarchia Informale (FAI)] and its associates are proven beyond reasonable doubt NOT ANARCHISTS. To see the Website of this Congress - Click here! 

Behind this conclusion are objective facts, also historical, about FAI and the scientific practically certain valid theory/resolutions mentioned in this PPPPS, all in all practically certain evidence and proof that FAI is marxist and not anarchist. There is no significant difference between the de facto terrorist actions and policy, i.e. the consequences of the use of the means involved, of FAI and, say, RAF-ml (marxist-leninists) also known as the Baader-Meinhof-mob, a well known ultra-authoritarian leftwing extremist marxist ochlarchy included terrorist group. There is no profit motive, indicating capitalism. And the terrorist acts are extremism. Thus, all evidence points to ultra-authoritarian socialism, i.e. FAI is a marxist leftwing extremist ochlarchist group. The evidence speaks for itself, but more than 50 000 anarchists confirming the validity of the proof add weight behind. Sailing under false anarchist flag of course does not make FAI anarchist, quite the opposite. In addition FAI this time has attacked the Anarchy of Switzerland, i.e. significant libertarian socialism, also indicating that FAI is authoritarian socialist.

The authoritarian marxist and communist provocateur tactic of falsely posing as 'anarchists' (in the false meaning of ochlarchists), making ochlarchy, i.e. mob rule broadly defined including chaos, and putting the blame on anarchists to a) discredit the libertarian movement as much as possible, b) create aggression against anarchists, anarchism and anarchy and c) call for a strong, authoritarian marxist (including communist) party and its rule, is d) well known. Similar is valid for all State/government/archy/authority provocateurs including their followers. Anarchists take actions to stop such provocateurs and this tactic, via a.o.t. the International Anarchist Tribunal (IAT-APT) handing out Brown Cards and expulsions from the anarchist movement, and the Anarchist International Security Council (AISC)... More information about marxist and other provocateurs are found at External links, Anarchy debate, Freedom Online and IAT-APT International branch, search for provocateur in these files, also see IAT-APT Nordic branch and search for provokat¯r.

Practically certain anarchy cannot be created or achieved via ochlarchy. Ochlarchy is in itself authoritarian, usually ultra-authoritarian, and can only result in authoritarian and even ultra-authoritarian, i.e. totalitarian, rule. A development towards real democracy, i.e. anarchy, must be done by the people's actions - more and more, i.e. act with dignity, use real matter of fact arguments and add weight behind via direct actions, including mass actions & industrial actions, and via organization, dialog and elections, of course without ochlarchy! The Anarchist International (AI/IFA) and The Anarchist International Information Service (AIIS) are junctions in this connection. 

27.12.2010. Italian bomb disposal experts have defused a parcel bomb sent to the Greek embassy in Rome. Police said that a second suspect parcel, sent to the Venezuelan embassy, turned out to contain no explosives. Practically certain no anarchists involved... The anarchists condemn the bomb attack and the bomb hoax, i.e. terrorism, and not anarchist and anarchism. 

31.12.2010. The Norwegian TV2 gets a special Brown Card Baddie Prize in this connection, see Anarkisttribunalets Brunt Kort Verstingspris til TV2. 

Ochlarchists, not anarchists in Greece

10-11.05.2005 No anarchist group behind taking of 150 hostages and violence in Greece. Small groups of ochlarchists, some students at the university, regularly disrupt peaceful protest marches by other groups in a bid to provoke police. They have also been blamed for small gas canister-type bomb attacks on banks, police stations and embassies. 20.05.2005 Greek ochlarchists falsely posing as and/or called "anarchists" by the media clashed with the police. These acts of mob rule including terrorism are done by ochlarchists, not anarchists, although they may be posing as such. The IAT gives a Brown Card to these groups of terroristical and violent ochlarchists and the newsmedia spreading disinformation, mixing them up with anarchists. The Brown Card of course also means expulsion of the ochlarchist and terrorist infiltrators, falsely posing as and/or called "anarchists" by the media, from the anarchist movement. Anti-capitalist ochlarchists/ochlarchs are authoritarian socialists, i.e. marxists, not anarchists. Anti-capitalist rioters and/or terrorists are practically certain marxist leftwing extremists.

Green "Anarchy" = ochlarchy, Brown Card to the Green Anarchy Collective and more 

 20.09.2004. The so called Green Anarchy Collective writes in an article in Green Anarchy # 17: "We feel that it is important to move towards a radically decentralized world, ... destroy all the institutions and physical manifestations [of civilization]... We want to become uncivilized. In more general terms, this is the trajectory of green anarchy in thought and practice. Civilization... is ... our enemy. "   

What we need is a more civilized world, i.e. libertarian, not destruction of the civilization. A radically decentralized world without civilization will end up in  authoritarian ochlarchy  (mob rule) tendencies as mentioned in the Oslo Convention of 1990. Green Anarchy is thus mixing up anarchy and authoritarian tendencies and gets a  Brown Card, meaning expulsion from the anarchist movement. Also the group Fertile Ground and the nutter-guru-arch Fertile Ground Board member Dillon Thomson have got Brown Cards from IAT-APT and are thus expulsed from the anarchist movement. 

Brown Cards to Gabrielle Brogge and Associated Press, criminal tourists to the Anarchy of Switzerland, Earth Liberation Front (ELF), Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and "Terra selvaggia," (Wilderness) & provocateurs

20.07.2011. Gabrielle Brogge and Associated Press reported: 3-year prison terms recommended in Swiss bomb plot. Prosecutors in Switzerland's highest criminal court Wednesday recommended prison sentences of at least three years for a trio of alleged eco-terrorists charged with plotting a bomb attack on a planned IBM Corp. nanotech research facility near Zurich. Federal prosecutor Hansjoerg Stalder said the three brought powerful explosives to Switzerland in the spring of 2010 to carry out their intended attack on IBM's $90 million research center, which opened in May. "They came as criminal tourists to Switzerland," Stadler told the court. 

The trial, held under tight security in the Federal Criminal Court, has drawn attention to a loose network of European [marxist provocateurs and false so called] anarchists who have grown more violent and coordinated during the continent's financial crisis and been linked to recent bombings in Greece, Switzerland and Italy. Police said the three defendants - 35-year-old Costantino Alfonso Ragusa, his 29-year-old wife Silvia Ragusa Guerini and their 26-year-old Swiss friend Luca "Billy" Cristos Bernasconi - were arrested last year carrying explosive gel and several types of fuel - a combination with almost the explosive power of TNT. 

But the defense argued that police wrongly treated the three as presumed criminals from the start, snaring them in a fake traffic stop near Zurich, about two miles (3 kilometers) from the IBM facility. Stalder described the defendants, the Italian couple and a Swiss man, as having close links to the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and Animal Liberation Front (ALF), both extremist [brown, red and green] movements that have claimed responsibility since the 1990s for a variety of what authorities describe as eco-terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States. He said Ragusa and Guerini are known as founders and members of the Italian movement "Terra selvaggia," or Wilderness, which has connections to ELF, and that Bernasconi is an Italian member of ALF. Stalder said each of the three should serve at least three years in prison, without suspending any of the time already served since their arrests, because of the seriousness of the planned crime. A verdict is expected Friday. 

22.07.2011 AP reports: Three environmental activists with links to European anarchist groups were found guilty Friday of plotting a bomb attack on an unfinished IBM nanotech research facility near the Swiss city of Zurich. The Italian couple, Ragusa and Guerini, and Bernasconi, a Swiss citizen living in Italy, were handed prison sentences ranging from 3 years and 4 months to 3 years and 8 months. This was slightly higher than federal prosecutors had recommended. 

The IAT-APT hands out Brown Cards according to the Oslo Convention to a) Gabrielle Brogge and Associated Press, as well as b) the ultra-authoritarian & extremist Costantino Alfonso Ragusa, Silvia Ragusa Guerini, Luca "Billy" Cristos Bernasconi, Earth Liberation Front (ELF), Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and "Terra selvaggia," (Wilderness), and c) a loose network of European [marxist provocateurs and false so called] anarchists, meaning they are not anarchists and expulsed from the anarchist movement. Ad b) in case these persons and groups falsely claim to be anarchists, remember they are not anarchists, and expulsed from the anarchist movement. 

Brown Cards to Europol and director Rob Wainwright

Orwellian "1984" newspeak Big Brother lie-report from Europol about so called "anarchist" terrorists in Europe, in reality ochlarchists and not anarchists

In the "TE-SAT 2010 EU TERRORISM SITUATION AND TREND REPORT", see Europol - European Police - TE-SAT 2010, Europol declares: "The agenda of anarchist terrorist groups is usually revolutionary, anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian. Not all Member States distinguish between activities of left-wing and anarchist terrorist groups in their contributions. For this reason, both categories are discussed in the same chapter of this report. Greece, Italy and Spain reported 40 attacks by leftwing and anarchist terrorists. Actions by anarchist groups are becoming more violent and sometimes well planned. After a quiet period of two years, the FAI (Federazione Anarchica Informale) claimed two attacks in Italy which targeted the director of the CIE (Centro di Identifi cazione ed Espulsione), and the Bocconi University in Milan." 

The so called "anarchist terrorists" (provocateurs) mentioned, in Greece, Italy and Spain, the Italian "FAI (Federazione Anarchica Informale)" being the only such group mentioned by name in Europol's report, are in reality terrorist ochlarchists, the opposite of anarchists, and have got Brown Cards from IAT-APT, and are thus expulsed from the anarchist movement. NB! They are thus not members of the anarchist movement. Using the "litmustest" above on the mentioned cases, it is clear that the so called "anarchist terrorists" mentioned by Europol, in reality are marxist leftwing extremist ochlarchs/ochlarchists - NOT anarchists.. 

Europol's terrorist accusations against anarchists are completely false. The truth is that no anarchists in Greece, Italy and Spain or other places on Earth have participated in terrorist attacks, i.e. ochlarchical actions, not now and not before. Ochlarchy is mob rule broadly defined including terrorism. The only violence anarchists accept is defensive violence, proportionate, in self defense, see, say, direct action. The mentioned violence including terrorism is not of this kind, and are done by extremist ochlarchs/ochlarchists, practically certain marxist leftwing extremist ochlarchs/ochlarchists, not by anarchists. 

Anarchists should in general not be mixed up with left-wingers. Anarchists are not extremists and have less than 50% authoritarian degree, and are found in the middle and upwards on the economic-political map, while the extreme left have more than 666 per thousand authoritarian degree, are totalitarian, see System theory and economic political map. Anarchists are real democrats, not the opposite, i.e. extremists and totalitarian.

To mix up opposites as anarchists with terrorists, a form of ochlarchists, is equally authoritarian as mixing up opposites as peace and war, as Big Brother did in Orwell's "1984" newspeak. Ochlarchists and anarchists are opposites. Such Big Brother notes in the media broadly defined, including Europol's report, also produce copycat ochlarchists and terrorists - mainly mislead youths, falsely posing as "anarchists". It should be stopped, and the IAT-APT hands out Brown Cards, as free criticism of this authoritarian tendency - according to the Oslo Convention, - this time to Europol and director Rob Wainwright and newsmedia spreading their disinformation. The trial and Brown Card verdict against Europol by IAT-APT, happened 22.07.2010. Europol has no public e-mail address, but the IAT-APT has posted a message to Europol on their "Media Request" mail-form with a link to this resolution.

Bond denied for defendant in 1983 Conn. robbery

By MICHAEL MELIA
(April 26th, 2012 @ 2:40pm)
http://ktar.com/509/1531886/Bond-denied-for-defendant-in-1983-Conn-robbery

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A federal judge denied a bond request Thursday
from a Puerto Rican nationalist charged in one of the largest cash
robberies in U.S. history, saying the man lived as a fugitive for more
than 25 years and cannot be trusted to appear for trial.

Norberto Gonzalez Claudio, who was captured by the FBI in Puerto Rico in
May, asked to be released from a Rhode Island detention center so that he
could consult associates more easily as he considers his legal options in
the case of the 1983 Connecticut robbery.

Several family members and supporters offered to put up $400,000 in real
estate to secure his bond, and Gonzalez gave assurances he would not
jeopardize their finances by fleeing.

But Magistrate Judge Thomas Smith said in his ruling that the risk of
flight was too great to release Gonzalez.

"Mr. Gonzalez-Claudio's ties to his family were not powerful enough
to keep him from living as a fugitive for over 25 years and, hence, the
court cannot place much credence in his promise," Smith
wrote.

Gonzalez, who is in his mid-60s, is accused of aiding the 1983 robbery of
$7 million from a Wells Fargo armored car depot in West Hartford, Conn.
The heist, the largest cash robbery in U.S. history at the time, was
orchestrated by Los Macheteros, a militant wing of the broader movement
for Puerto Rican independence.

Gonzalez has pleaded not guilty to federal charges including bank
robbery, conspiracy and transportation of stolen money.

In his ruling, Smith noted that the agents who arrested Gonzalez in a
town in central Puerto Rico also found in his possession bomb-making
manuals and an unregistered, loaded machine gun at his bedside. He said
that in addition to any prison time imposed in Connecticut, Gonzalez
faces potential imprisonment in Puerto Rico for having the
weapon.

¬†

The Venceremos Brigade
JOIN THE 43rd Contingent: July 8-23rd, 2012
¬†
The 43rd contingent of the VB will travel to Cuba in the summer of 2012. The tentative cost is about $1500. If you are interested in participating, please contact us.
¬†
Who is the Venceremos Brigade?
In 1969, a coalition of young people formed the Venceremos ("We Shall Overcome") Brigade, as a means of showing solidarity with the Cuban Revolution by working side by side with Cuban workers and challenging U.S. policies towards Cuba, including the economic blockade and our government‚Äôs ban on travel to the island. The first Brigades participated in sugar harvests and subsequent Brigades have done agricultural and construction work in many parts of the island.¬†
Over the last¬†43 years, the VB has given over 8,000 people from the U.S. the opportunity for a life-changing experience. While the trip has evolved over time, the Venceremos Brigade has always kept its format of work, educational activities, and travel. In addition, we remain committed to organizing the most diverse contingents possible; Brigadistas are young and older, of many races, nationalities, socio-economic classes, and sexual orientations. 
¬†
The oldest Cuba solidarity organization in the world, the VB has never requested permission from the U.S. government to go to Cuba‚Äìand we never will! We believe it is our right as U.S. citizens to travel free of U.S. government obstacles. We also believe that we have much to learn from Cuba and the best way to do that is to travel there and see for ourselves!

creo que debes irte de cuba gente como tu no serven en cuba,.....
...
Ahora si crees que solo eso es democracia, entonces no entiendes nada, en las demcracias capitalistas
LO QUE SI ENTIENDE TODO EL MUNDO, QUE DE LOS PAISES SUCIALISTAS , LOS POCOS REMANETES SE ESCAPAN TODOS LOS QUE PUEDEN
Y LOS ZURDELIS DEL MUNDO , LOS BO... BUDOS, DE IRSE DEL PAIS, SE VAN A PAISES "SUPER CAPITALISTAS" EMPEZANDO POR U.S.A 
AUN NO VI NI ESCUCH… QUE ALGUN ZURDO SE HAYA IDO A VIVIR A CUBA 
Y HABLANDO DE CUBA 
Frutos amargos de 60 aÒos de comunismo:
LA DESTRUCCION ESPIRITUAL, MORAL 
Y PSICOLOGICA DE UN PUEBLO 
Los frutos amargos del comunismo cubano, y la manipulacion de la religiosidad popular por parte del regimen, como una valvula de escape para disminuir las tensiones sociales, son analizados en este capitulo del libro
†
"CUBA COMUNISTA: VERG‹ENZA DE NUESTRO TIEMPO", 
†
publicado poco antes de la visita papal; un texto que posee enorme actualidad, que todo cubano amante de la libertad debe leer, comentar y difundir
La implacable maquina de persecucion montada por el regimen comunista --con sus aspectos juridicos, politicos, policiales, etc.-- no podia dejar de producir frutos amargos a lo largo de 50 aÒos de revolucion. 
El resultado ha sido 
LA QUIEBRA ESPIRITUAL, MORAL Y PSICOLOGICA DE LOS DESDICHADOS habitantes de la isla-carcel.( LOS QUE NO PUDIERON ESCAPAR)
Es la realidad de un pueblo que esta en una "gran soledad", segun expresion de Mons. Boza Masvidal, y "se siente abandonado" en su dolor y su tragedia, de acuerdo con lo manifestado por el obispo de Holguin, Mons. Hector Luis Lucas PeÒa, y por el secretario adjunto de la Conferencia Episcopal Cubana, P. Jose Felix Perez Riera, durante un simposio de la entidad "Ayuda a la Iglesia que sufre", efectuado en Alemania en 1996. 
†
Una realidad que pocos se atreven a denunciar
Una realidad sobre la cual pocos se atreven a mirar de frente y, menos aun, a denunciar. 
Una realidad cuya causa principal es el sistema comunista imperante en la isla, 
"INTRINSECAMENTE PERVERSO". 
†
Una realidad cuyo mayor responsable es el dictador Fidel Castro, quien inclusive despues de su entrevista con el Pontifice, en Roma-- continuo reiterando "su fidelidad a los principios marxistas-leninistas", tal como denuncio el P. Bernardo Cervellera, director de la agencia vaticana "Fides", en cable desde La Habana, en marzo de 1997. 
†
†
UNA REALIDAD CUYO REGIMEN, "EN NOMBRE DE UNA DICTADURA, SOLO HA PRODUCIDO FRACASOS ECONOMICOS Y HUMANOS", 
†
segun expresion del P. Cervellera en el citado articulo. 
Una realidad que, segun diversos observadores, llevara aÒos y aÒos para ser subsanada --tal vez, generaciones-- despues de la liberacion de Cuba. Una realidad que llama a no dejarse llevar por excesivos y faciles optimismos sobre el futuro inmediato de la isla-carcel. 
UNA REALIDAD QUE CLAMA AL MUNDO POR LAS ABERRANTES INJUSTICIAS QUE CONTIENE EN SU SENO. 
Una realidad que lleva implicita una censura y un cuestionamiento a todos aquellos que en Occidente guardan silencio sobre esa "verg¸enza de nuestro tiempo" y de nuestro continente...
Transcribiremos a continuacion algunos autorizados testimonios que describen esos frutos amargos del comunismo cubano.
"CULTURA DE LA MUERTE"
Mons. Eduardo Boza Masvidal --ex obispo auxiliar de La Habana, expulsado por el regimen comunista en 1961-- escribio un articulo donde narra aspectos del deterioro moral en la Cuba de hoy, fruto del regimen comunista. Entre otras constataciones, bajo el titulo "La cultura de la muerte en Cuba", el obispo exiliado afirma:
-----------------"La promiscuidad de adolescentes y jovenes que promueve el gobierno les hace perder el sentido de moralidad y respeto mutuo. 
---------------- El aborto fue legalizado en 1965 y se practica ampliamente con todo el apoyo del gobierno. Un tercio de las muchachas jovenes entre 15 y 19 aÒos han tenido por lo menos un aborto". Mas recientemente, un cable de EFE, desde La Habana, confirmaba ese panorama, atribuyendo "la alta prevalencia de los abortos" a "las crisis de las familias, los altos indices de divorcios, los padres que no se preocupan por los hijos", etc. De acuerdo con estimaciones del ministerio de Salud Publica, alrededor de un 60% de las operaciones ginecologicas corresponden a abortos, correspondiendo un tercio del total a adolescentes.
MAYOR PROPORCION DE ABORTOS DEL HEMISFERIO
Continua el prelado cubano:
"En total, de cada diez bebitos por nacer, seis son abortados. Esta proporcion es la mayor en el hemisferio y quizas sea la mayor en el mundo entero". 
"Cuba tiene el menor numero de nacimientos entre los paises de America Latina. 
============================================== 
En vista de esto no hay que sorprenderse de que Cuba sea el primer pais del mundo que utilizo el tejido cerebral de bebes abortados para hacer trasplantes a enfermos de 'Alzheimer'. Y actualmente decenas de pacientes extranjeros pagan miles de dolares al gobierno cubano para hacerse esos trasplantes".
========================================= 
-----------------------Prostitucion y suicidios
Mons. Boza Masvidal constata tambien que solo en La Habana "se calcula que hay alrededor de 35.000 prostitutas", aÒadiendo que Cuba cuenta con otro triste privilegio: 
†
----------------------"EL MAS ALTO NIVEL DE SUICIDIOS EN EL HEMISFERIO". 
†
Esta constatacion es hoy reconocida por informes de los propios organismos gubernamentales. Es el caso, por ejemplo, de un estudio de la Dra. Teresita Garcia Perez, publicado en el Boletin del Instituto de Medicina Legal de La Habana, de marzo de 1995, donde se reconoce que la tasa de 22,5 por 100 mil habitantes es la mas alta de America, siendo el doble de la del segundo pais colocado en el triste ranking. 
Todo ello, asevera el obispo, no es sino un "boton de muestra" de la "situacion tan dramatica que vive Cuba en muchos otros aspectos"; y cita el autorizado testimonio del P. Paul Marx OSB, conocido dirigente del movimiento Human Life International, que visitara la isla-carcel en fecha reciente.
"GRAN SOLEDAD" Y "DESESPERACION" DE UN PUEBLO
Mons. Boza lamenta que, delante de ese cuadro, el pueblo cubano este en una "gran soledad" en su lucha "por la vida y la libertad". 
"PARECE QUE ES EL UNICO PUEBLO EN NUESTRA AMERICA QUE NO TIENE DERECHO A SER LIBRE", 
aÒade, manifestando que delante de ese abandono "es dificil entender a los presidentes latinoamericanos por la incoherencia entre lo que dicen y lo que hacen: hablan mucho de democracia y celebran reuniones para promoverla en todo el continente, y a la vez reciben con todos los honores al gobernante del regimen mas opresivo y antidemocratico, lo apoyan en todo, lo aplauden estruendosamente cuando habla, Y HASTA LE PERMITEN QUE LES DE CONSEJOS SOBRE COMO ERRADICAR EL HAMBRE EN EL MUNDO, CUANDO EL TIENE A SU PUEBLO SUMIDO EN NIVELES DE HAMBRE" Y DE "DESESPERACION".
Perdida de la 
--------------------- "CAPACIDAD DE PENSAR", "QUIEBRA DE VALORES MORALES" Y SENTIMIENTO DE ABANDONO
"El pueblo cubano ha perdido su capacidad de pensar, capacidad que es la mas propiamente humana", afirmaron por su parte el obispo de Holguin, Mons. Hector Luis Lucas PeÒa, y el secretario adjunto de la Conferencia Episcopal Cubana, P. Jose Felix Perez Riera, en el ya mencionado simposio de la entidad "Ayuda a la Iglesia que sufre", efectuado en Alemania. 
Ambos eclesiasticos se refirieron tambien a "la quiebra del orden de los valores morales que daÒa el tejido de la misma vida familiar y social" de la isla-carcel; lamentaron igualmente que "el pueblo cubano se siente abandonado y existe un abismo entre la realidad en que vive y la imagen que sus gobernantes quieren proyectar al mundo".
La alusion de los mencionados eclesiasticos cubanos a la disminucion de la capacidad de pensar del pueblo cubano, indica la profundidad del deterioro de las mentes obtenido por el regimen comunista. En este sentido, ya en 1994 el periodista Glenn Albin, durante una visita a la isla-carcel, habia constatado que "la generalidad de la poblacion ha sido reducida a una condicion semejante a la de zoombies", y que "en las calles el pueblo parece insensible y mudo..."
"La mentira es totalmente normal"
A mediados de 1997, el Padre Costanzo Donegana --de la revista Mondo e Missione, organo del Pontificio Instituto para las Misiones Extranjeras (PIME)-- viajo a Cuba para observar la realidad de la isla, antes del viaje papal. Posteriormente, publico un amplio reportaje sobre lo que habia visto y oido en la isla-carcel.
Entre sus entrevistados, esta un sacerdote residente en Cuba que hizo una profunda radiografia de la realidad espiritual y moral del cubano de hoy, de la cual transcribimos algunos trechos. 
"En la gente, sobre todo en las generaciones mas jovenes, ha penetrado la siguiente mentalidad: la mentira es totalmente normal, porque la han visto practicar en casa como un medio de sobrevivencia".
"ENTRE LOS JOVENES LA ALEGRIA ES ALGO DESCONOCIDO"
"Preocupa constatar que entre los jovenes de Cuba la alegria es algo desconocido. (...) La juventud ha vivido y vive en una sociedad privada de valores tradicionales. La cubanidad ya no existe mas. El respeto por el projimo es una utopia, porque el sistema esta baseado en la intolerancia y en el rechazo de la diversidad. Los jovenes son obligados a viver dentro de mecanismos que los llevan a la hipocresia, a la duplicidad".
"Todos roban en Cuba"
"De manera analoga, el robo se volvio usual al punto que podemos decir que todos lo practican en Cuba. (...) El gobierno no pone a disposicion los bienes necesarios, y entonces la gente roba: en los hoteles, en los negocios para extranjeros, en los hospitales..."
"UNA DE LAS MAYORES POBREZAS ES EL CANSANCIO DE LAS PERSONAS. Un cansancio existencial, sin ninguna perspectiva, sin ningun proyecto, sin ninguna claridad de horizontes. (...) Esto empobrece tremendamente, y genera una pasividad y una falta de creatividad enormes".
"Esta en curso un extraordinario proceso de empobrecimiento del pueblo, un hecho mucho mas profundo y daÒino que el empobrecimiento economico".
"Estilo de vida que vulgariza", y lleva a la perdida de la propia "conciencia del mal"
"Otro aspecto es la falta de espiritualidad, no solo en el sentido religioso del termino. Se trata de un estilo de vida que vulgariza al hombre".
"La situacion economica es grave, pero lo es mucho mas la situacion moral, porque esa perdida de valores morales y espirituales en general no es percibida por la gente, aun cuando a veces lo sienta. Me preocupan los jovenes, porque asimilan esta mentalidad. Dado que no hay conciencia del mal, el mal se vuelve justamente la manera normal de comportarse. En esto consiste el empobrecimiento mas profundo de nuestra sociedad, que provoca un achatamiento de la persona. Es muy dificil salir de el."
Revolucion en las tendencias, la mas profunda, la mas destructiva
Esas afirmaciones del sacerdote entrevistado por el P. Donegana --haciendo referencia a un "estilo de vida" degradante para la persona humana-- revisten especial importancia. 
En efecto, en materia de persecucion religiosa los criticos del regimen comunista usualmente muestran la accion destructiva de la propaganda anticatolica declarada, de las leyes inicuas que la respaldan, y de la represion policial, todo lo cual posee indudable gravedad. Pero no consideran suficientemente ese plano a que hace referencia el sacerdote mencionado, que es la creacion de un ambiente socio-psicologico en el cual se hace practicamente imposible el cumplimiento de los Mandamientos de la Ley de Dios. Por esa via, se provoca una asfixia espiritual de los catolicos, preparando las condiciones inclusive para la perdida de la fe.
Se trata de aquello que el eminente pensador catolico brasileÒo Prof. Plinio CorrÍa de Oliveira denomina "revolucion en las tendencias", a traves de la cual los revolucionarios tienen como objetivo obtener un desarreglo y una exacerbacion de las inclinaciones desordenadas del alma humana.
CorrÍa de Oliveira distingue tres niveles en todo proceso revolucionario: en las tendencias, en las ideas y en los hechos. Y muestra como el primero de ellos --que se opera en las tendencias-- es el mas profundo, porque modifica las mentalidades, los modos de ser, las costumbres, etc., sin necesariamente tocar, en su inicio, en las ideas. 
En una segunda etapa, el desarreglo de las tendencias profundas prepara al alma para aceptar las doctrinas revolucionarias; y en una tercera, las personas ya aceptan y colaboran en la transformacion --por medios cruentos o incruentos-- de las instituciones, las leyes, etc., tanto en la esfera espiritual cuanto en la temporal.
Desde ese punto de vista, la Revolucion que se verifica en la Cuba de hoy es mucho mas terrible y abarcativa pues utiliza los enormes recursos del Estado totalitario, del Partido Comunista, de los centros de enseÒanza, etc., para impulsar la revolucion tendencial en cuanto mecanismo profundo de transformacion espiritual de un pueblo.
El Profesor CorrÍa de Oliveira explica que esos tres niveles del proceso revolucionario son, de algun modo, escalonados. Pero al mismo tiempo aclara que de tal modo dichos niveles se interpenetran en el tiempo, que ellos no pueden ser vistos como unidades cronologicas distintas, y no siempre se diferencian nitidamente unos de otros.
"Escuela, lugar de iniciacion al amor libre", "con participacion activa de profesores"
Veamos a continuacion de que manera el regimen empuja a los jovenes cubanos --de manera sistematica-- a violar el 6o. Mandamiento (No pecaras contra la castidad) y el 9o. (No codiciaras la mujer de tu projimo); con lo cual se opera una profunda deformacion moral que contraria los principios de la familia cristiana, del matrimonio indisoluble, de la fidelidad conyugal, etc.
A ese respecto, el P. Donegana seÒala: "Varias personas me han confirmado el hecho de que la escuela es un lugar de iniciacion al amor libre. Esto ocurre sobre todo durante la 'escuela del campo': a partir del septimo grado (cerca de los 12 aÒos) hasta el pre-universitario completo (duodecimo grado), cada aÒo todos los alumnos son enviados a efectuar trabajos agricolas por el periodo de un mes. Trabajan 8 horas por dia, y en la noche ocurren las cosas mas aberrantes: sexo libre como si fuese la cosa mas natural del mundo. Y con la participacion activa de los profesores".
Para aquilatar la dimension de esta situacion de corrupcion institucionalizada, tengase en cuenta la denuncia hecha por la Junta Patriotica Cubana, de que durante 1996 alrededor de 430.000 estudiantes y profesores fueron enviados por el regimen a trabajar en la agricultura.
øPuede extraÒar que uno de los resultados "mas significativos" de todo ello sea --segun el reportaje de Mondo e Missione-- "la prostitucion femenina y masculina a partir de los 12 aÒos"?
øSe justifican, delante de ese cuadro, faciles optimismos?
Pese a lo anterior, algunos observadores de la realidad cubana han demostrado un excesivo optimismo en la interpretacion de la vuelta de fieles a las iglesias, la multiplicacion de los bautismos, etc., en los ultimos aÒos. "Los seminarios vuelven a poblarse, las iglesias estan llenas, los bautismos se multiplican", exclama, exultante, Philippe Delaroche, enviado de Le Figaro Magazine. 
Sin embargo, como hemos constatado --y como tambien veremos a continuacion-- no todos comparten ese optimismo, el cual corresponde mas bien a un "wishful thinking" que a la realidad de los hechos. 
El desarraigo de la verdadera Religion en las almas de los cubanos fue obtenido sistematicamente por el regimen comunista, a traves de largas decadas de verdadero genocidio espiritual. Y ese proceso no ha ocurrido en vano. 
El caso de Polonia post-comunista
Basta pensar en la profunda crisis espiritual y moral en que quedo sumida la otrora catolicisima Polonia --despues de decadas de dominio comunista-- para no alentar expectativas ilusorias sobre la real situacion de la sociedad cubana, aun cuando en materia de conversiones a la Religion catolica pueda haber sintomas alentadores. 
Es conocido el alto grado de permisivismo y degradacion moral que afecta a la Polonia post-comunista, fruto del regimen marxista que asolo ese pais. Lo que lleva a la mayoria de la poblacion, que se dice catolica, a aceptar costumbres y leyes que contradicen las enseÒanzas de la Iglesia. Es lo que constatan los periodistas Marco Politi y Carl Bernstein, en biografia sobre S.S. Juan Pablo II, Su Santidad Juan Pablo II y la historia oculta de nuestro tiempo. En ese sentido, ellos comentan que el Pontifice --despues de numerosos viajes y Misas multitudinarias-- dejo sentir su consternacion ante una situacion de disolucion de las costumbres. Los referidos periodistas ponen el ejemplo de los debates en torno del aborto. "Sus amonestaciones (del Pontifice) no tuvieron efecto frente a la nueva Polonia, en donde la idea de libre eleccion en materia sexual ya estaba tan interiorizada que la mayor parte de la gente no veia contradiccion alguna en llamarse
 catolica (95%) y oponerse a la prohibicion del aborto (65%). (...) Para el Papa, Polonia se habia transformado de repente en un ejemplo de derrota".
Polonia "se descubrio profundamente laica despues de la caida de la Cortina de Hierro", constata en el mismo sentido un periodista italiano.
Reconstruccion que podra llevar varias generaciones
øCuanto tiempo, y cuantos sacrificios, llevara la reconstruccion moral y espiritual del pais, a partir del momento de la liberacion de nuestra Patria? Sin duda, cuando caiga el comunismo, comenzara una lucha --toda ella de caracter espiritual-- para la cristianizacion de Cuba: "Pienso que deberan pasar algunas generaciones antes de llegar a la superacion de estos males morales y espirituales del pueblo, que se expresan en comportamientos como la simulacion y la doble moral", afirma el ya citado sacerdote que fuera entrevistado por el P. Donegana, de Mondo e Missione. Notese que el habla, nada mas y nada menos, de varias generaciones...
Seminarios
Analicemos --como ejemplos caracteristicos de un superficial optimismo sobre la realidad religiosa cubana-- las tres afirmaciones del enviado de Le Figaro Magazine en el parrafo que transcribimos en el penultimo item. 
Comencemos con la afirmacion "los seminarios vuelven a poblarse". 
El P. Chasco, misionero franciscano en Cuba, narra que en los primeros seis aÒos de actividades apostolicas en Cuba, 132 jovenes cubanos le manifestaron algun tipo de inquietud vocacional. Pero, constata a continuacion de manera sensata y prudente, "la educacion oficial del Estado cubano ha borrado casi del todo, la cultura religiosa, por lo que antes de admitirles a esos aspirantes, es absolutamente necesario un proceso de aÒos de formacion religiosa en la Fe y de formacion vocacional". Observese bien: el referido misionero preve largos aÒos de apostolado con esos jovenes, antes mismo de ser admitidos como seminaristas franciscanos. No es algo, por lo tanto, que pueda darse de la noche a la maÒana.
El P. Donegana, por su parte, constata que de hecho "las vocaciones religiosas son mas numerosas", y existen reales casos de conversion. "Pero, aclara acto seguido, la perseverancia es pequeÒa. Entran muchos, sin embargo al final llegan en menor numero que los sacerdotes diocesanos. Es dificil hacerle la propuesta vocacional explicita al joven cubano. "Los jovenes se resisten a aceptar un compromiso por cualquier cosa seria debido a la crisis de la sociedad y de la familia, de las cuales son las mayores victimas".
Tambien, aÒade el mencionado sacerdote, "existe el peligro de que un joven busque la vocacion sacerdotal y religiosa como una promocion social", "para alcanzar aquello que no tiene (posicion social, respeto, instruccion y un relativo bienestar)". 
Iglesias
Analicemos la segunda afirmacion del enviado de Le Figaro Magazine: "Las iglesias estan llenas". 
En relacion a este aspecto de la realidad religiosa cubana, es preciso considerar una vez mas el testimonio aportado por el P. Donegana, quien afirma que de hecho "en los ultimos diez aÒos, los catolicos habrian pasado del 2 al 12 por ciento de la poblacion". Sin embargo, el reconoce a continuacion que en la Iglesia cubana se dio a esa cifra una interpretacion excesivamente optimista: "En un primer momento se penso que hubiese sonado la hora del gran triunfo, del gran cambio. Despues se dieron cuenta que no era asi, que se encontraban frente a un crecimiento muy significativo para la Iglesia, pero limitado a un porcentaje reducido de la poblacion".
Tampoco se puede olvidar el hecho de que en la poblacion cubana "la mayoria, educada durante treinta aÒos en un ateismo total, no sabe quien es Dios y mucho menos quien es el Papa", aÒade el citado sacerdote.
Ademas, como el periodista de Le Figaro Magazine reconoce en su reportaje, las creencias de muchos catolicos estan "mezcladas con supersticiones vudus" y "animistas", incompatibles con los principios de la verdadera Religion. 
En ese sentido, una enviada del diario La Segunda --citando informaciones recogidas en la isla-- sostiene que el "70% de los isleÒos practican la santeria". La "santeria" es la denominacion con que se denomina a la religion yoruba, nacida en el Africa negra y traida a Cuba y a otros paises del continente por esclavos. En Brasil se la conoce como "candomble", y en Haiti como "vudu". Para aquilatar la difusion de la "santeria" en Cuba, debe tenerse en cuenta algo que el profesor universitario nigeriano Wanda Abimbola, especialista en dicha religion pagana, afirma: "Cuba es la segunda patria yoruba".
Ya en 1986, los obispos catolicos de Cuba habian constatado --en el documento final del ENEC-- "un resurgimiento de las supersticiones y de las religiones de corte animista", las cuales "no entraÒan grandes compromisos morales ni sociales"; y "cuyas referencias cristianas, cuando las hay, son superficiales". En una palabra, aÒadian los obispos, se trata de una forma de "neo-paganismo", que en particular arrastra a "alto numero de jovenes".
Es decir, son religiones sin principios --"sin compromisos morales"-- que de ninguna manera representan una oposicion o resistencia a las ideas comunistas, como las que provienen de la sana doctrina catolica (por tanto, que no este contaminada por errores como los de la "teologia de la liberacion" condenada por la Santa Sede). 
La confusion espiritual, el error y hasta la blasfemia en que estan sumergidas esas religiones sincretistas y neopaganas, queda en evidencia en la siguiente constatacion de enviados a La Habana del diario madrileÒo El Pais: la Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Patrona de Cuba, "en las religiones afro-cubanas se sincretiza con Ochun, 'orisha' (deidad) que simboliza la femineidad, la coqueteria y la sexualidad".
Al comentar la proximidad del viaje papal, el mencionado articulo da un dramatico ejemplo de la confusion espiritual que ha tomado cuenta de incontables cubanos: "Para muchos, el Pontifice sera un simbolo de fe y religion, pero sin duda la Patrona de Cuba seguira siendo para ellos Ochun, la diosa mulata de la sensualidad".
El propio periodista de Le Figaro Magazine, cuyas afirmaciones estamos analizando, aporta otro lamentable ejemplo de "sincretismo" religioso: "En la figura de San Lazaro, los santeros festejan a Babalu Aye, el dios de los leprosos". 
Religiosidad "neo-pagana", incentivada por el regimen
No puede extraÒar entonces que el propio regimen incentive ese tipo de religiosidad "neo-pagana" --que no perjudica su estabilidad-- a la manera de una valvula de escape para las tensiones sociales. De pasada, contribuye a crear una confusion religiosa que sin lugar a dudas perjudica la expansion de la verdadera Religion. 
"Lo mas perturbador es que la santeria no solo es tolerada, sino incentivada. Son numerosos los funcionarios del gobierno que ostentan brazaletes y collares que son insignias de su pertenencia al culto yoruba", constata un enviado de la revista Le Point, en articulo "Cuba: Le retour des sorciers", quien aÒade que "esa rehabilitacion ha sido inspirada por las mas altas instancias del regimen".
"Hay ocasiones en las que pareciera haberse sustituido el ateismo de Estado por la santeria cubana como religion oficial", declara por su parte el Cardenal de La Habana, Mons. Jaime Ortega. 
Se afirma inclusive que el propio dictador Castro se ha mostrado simpatizante de la "santeria".
"La religion como solucion"...
La religion como una "solucion" del gobierno comunista para disminuir las tensiones sociales, es uno de los temas abordados por la enviada a La Habana de Le Monde Diplomatique, Janette Habel, que escribe a ese proposito: "En la concepcion de los dirigentes, el incentivo de la religiosidad puede permitir la canalizacion de las tensiones sociales. 'Voy a ver un babalao para que me cambie la vida', canta el grupo 'Palmas y CaÒas' en la television. Ante las frustraciones y el sentimiento de inseguridad provocados por la crisis, 'la religion puede ser vista como una salida valida', concluye un articulo de la revista del Comite Central del Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC)" (cfr. HABEL, Janette, "Miser sur l'Eglise pour sauver la revolution cubaine?", subtitulo "La religion comme solution", Le Monde Diplomatique, Febr. 22, 1997).
De esa noticia --que se basa en afirmaciones de una revista del Partido Comunista-- se desprende una vez mas la constatacion a que ya nos hemos referido: ese tipo de religiosidad impregnada de neo-paganismo no incomoda para nada al regimen, pues no se ejerce "contra la existencia y fines del Estado socialista" (art. 62 de la Constitucion); mas aun, lo favorece en la medida en que sirve como valvula de escape para las presiones sociales.
Mons. Emilio Aranguren Echeverria, secretario de la Conferencia Episcopal Cubana, observo por su parte que, en la actual coyuntura, el regimen ve el factor religioso como un elemento "tranquilizante": "Tambien las dificultades materiales, sobre todo en estos ultimos aÒos, han empujado las autoridades a conceder una mayor libertad en materia de religion, considerandola un elemento 'tranquilizante' en medio de las penurias y las dificultades".
Bautismos
"Los bautismos se multiplican", fue el tercer y ultimo elemento resaltado por el periodista de Le Figaro Magazine, para justificar su vision optimista de la realidad religiosa cubana.
De hecho, segun el Anuario Pontificio, el numero de bautismos paso de 27.410 en 1986 para 70.081 en 1995. Cifra esperanzadora, por cierto. Pero testimonios recogidos por el P. Donegana muestran una "diversidad de motivaciones que impelen a las personas a acercarse a la Iglesia", y que llaman tambien a la cautela en materia de interpretaciones.
Asi, en el caso de los bautismos, estan aquellos que lo hacen por un sincero movimiento de conversion. Pero tambien "hay quien lo hace por conveniencia, en el momento en que se va del pais, pensando que un certificado de bautismo pueda servir como certificado de buena conducta frente a las autoridades norteamericanas". "Otros piden para bautizarse, porque la santeria, un culto afro-cubano, lo exige para sus adeptos", etc.
Ejemplo heroico y admirable: catolicos anticomunistas que han resistido presiones inimaginables
Hemos visto el estado de postracion espiritual y moral en que el comunismo ha dejado al pueblo cubano.
Hemos visto los beneficios que el regimen viene obteniendo con aquellos tipos de practica religiosa que no cuestionan los fundamentos de la sociedad comunista.
Hemos visto tambien --al transcribir articulo del ex preso politico Armando Valladares, y al dedicar capitulos especificos sobre la persecucion contra los catolicos-- diversos aspectos de la fraudulenta "politica religiosa" castrista; asi como actitudes lamentables de eclesiasticos de la isla que han asumido posiciones colaboracionistas en relacion al gobierno comunista.
En ese panorama, nos ha faltado decir una palabra sobre aquellos fieles catolicos que en Cuba, en nombre de la fe, han permanecido anticomunistas; y se han resistido a aceptar cualquier tipo de entendimiento con Castro.
Fieles catolicos que respetu

LOS VIAJES A CUBA 
Por JosÈ MartÌ. 
Nos trajo aquÌ la guerra y aquÌ nos mantiene el aborrecimiento a la tiranÌa, tan arraigado en nosotros, tan esencial a nuestra naturaleza, que no podrÌamos arranc·rnoslo sino con la carne viva! 
øA que hemos de ir all· cuando no es posible vivir con decoro ni parece aun llegada la hora de volver a morir...? øA que irÌamos a Cuba? A oÌr chasquear el l·tigo en espaldas de hombre, en espaldas cubanas, y no volar aunque no haya mas armas que ramas de ·rboles, a clavar en un tronco para ejemplo, la mano que nos castiga? 
øVer el consorcio repugnante de los hijos de los hÈroes, de los mismos, empequeÒecidos en la impureza, y los vicios importados que ostentan, ante los que debieran vivir de espaldas a ellos, su prosperidad inmunda? 
øSaludar, pedir, sonreÌr, dar nuestra mano, ver a la caterva que florece sobre nuestra angustia, como las mariposas negras y amarillas que nacen del estiÈrcol de los caminos?øVer un burÛcrata insolente que pasea su lujo, su carruaje, su dama, ante el pensador augusto que va a pie a su lado, sin tener de seguro donde buscar en su propia tierra el pan para su casa?
øVer en el bochorno a los ilustres, en el desamparo a los honrados, en complicidades vergonzosas al talento en compaÒÌa impura, a las mujeres sin los frutos de su suelo, al campesino, que tiene que ceder al soldado que maÒana lo ha de perseguir, hasta el cultivo de sus propias caÒas? 
øVer a un pueblo entero, a nuestro pueblo en quien el juicio llega hoy a donde llego ayer el valor, deshonrarse con la cobardÌa o el disimulo? PuÒal es poco para decir lo que eso duele. Ir, a tanta verg¸enza! Otros pueden. °°NOSOTROS NO PODEMOS!!

Greetings with Much Respect and Love.


I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to
the Puerto Rican people in PR and in the diaspora for the support you have
given me during the past 31 years.† I also want to express the same
gratitude to the freedom and justice loving people in the U.S. and in different
parts of the world for the solidarity they've shared with me. The support I've
received has been a fountain of strength that has helped me face and deal with
the difficult challenges I've experienced in prison during the past 31 years,
and to remain morally and spiritually strong to continue struggling and
resisting.


The 31 years seem to have passed
fleetingly. Many radical changes have occurred all over the world during this
period of time. In Latin America progressive presidents rule in Venezuela,
Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Brazil and Argentina. In the
last two countries the presidents are progressive women. And in Puerto Rico the
US navy is no longer present in Vieques. Unfortunately, the most important
change Puerto Ricans need has not taken place. Because colonialism seems to be
more entrenched now than ever.


It was JosÈ MartÌ who said that for a
people to be free they needed to be cultured. I believe Puerto Ricans are a
cultured people. Yet we still are a colonized people.† We are also a
morally, mentally, spiritually strong people. But we haven't been able to make
Puerto Rico a free and sovereign nation.


It was Albert Einstein who said that by
repeating the same experiment the results were always going to be the same.
Doing that is nothing else than an exercise in futility. And Puerto Rican
independentists have been repeating the same experiment for decades and obtaining
the same results without being able to achieve their goal of an independent and
sovereign nation. The celebration of plebiscites has been such an experiment.
So why do we continue engaging in Sisyphean tasks?† What should we do?
Let's pay heed to Einstein's wise warning.


My proposal is a simple one. Let's work on
the problems we can resolve with the means and resources we have at our
disposal. For example, let's take one problem related to the health issue we
are facing - obesity. To resolve this problem a simple change in lifestyle will
do. Eat a healthy diet, exercise and create a support network. We can also
start programs of urban gardening. There's space for such a program in the 78
municipalities in Puerto Rico. And in those spaces we can grow healthy products
that can help with a nutritional diet. We can look for alternative sources of
energy and of transportation. Let's start thinking of changes we can make in
our lifestyles and we can resolve some of the difficult problems we face. 

Problems shouldn't intimidate or scare us. They should produce ideas in our
heads and challenge us to find solutions. Finding solutions to problems give us
confidence, and help us transcend our colonized mentality.† And that
transcendence gets us closer to our goal of achieving an independent and
sovereign nation and a better and more just world. 



We are intelligent enough to
know what needs to be done. We can change lifestyles in Puerto Rico and in the
Puerto Rican diaspora and by doing so we will grow stronger morally,
physically, spiritually and mentally. We can make Puerto Rico a free and
sovereign nation.


En resistencia y lucha,
OLR.

KAYAKING FOR FREEDOM!
¬†
¬†

At approximately 5:59¬† A.M, ¬†on Thursday June 21st, the Puerto Rican activist Alberto De Jesus better known as Tito Kayak began rowing from the Paria Peninsula in Venezuela, throughout the Antilles to Puerto Rico. The journey will take him island by island follow the maritime path undertaken centuries ago by the Arawak indigenous people who populated island by island the Caribbean archipelago
¬† 
This daring effort is one of the many being undertaken by Puerto Rican people on the island and around the world in order to win the release of U.S. held Political Prisoner Oscar Lopez Rivera. The 69 years old pro-independence freedom fighter has been in United States federal prisons for over 31 years. Convicted only of the crime of seditious conspiracy, he is not scheduled to be considered for parole until 2027, in another 14 years. Rapists, embezzlers, drug dealers and murderers serve much shorter sentences for their crimes while Oscar Lopez Rivera is imprisoned as a political hostage.
¬† 
Political repression against pro Independence activists engaged in lawful activities has a long history in Puerto Rico and the diaspora. In 1937 the Puerto Rican police under orders of U.S. administrators assassinated 19 Nationalists and supporters and wounded over 150 in what is referred to as the Ponce massacre. Most recently the FBI shot and left without medical assistance until dead, pro Independence leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios. ¬†¬†These assassinations as well as other crimes committed against the pro Independence movement continue to mount and go unpunished. 
¬† 
The kayaking journey continues a new phase of patriotic activism. Tito is one of the activists who have a history of militant, daring actions on behalf of justice. ¬†Amongst his many actions, he initiated the wave of disruption of naval operations which proved pivotal in bringing about the end of the U.S. Navy‚Äôs bombing of the island municipality of Vieques Puerto Rico. He served one year in U.S. federal prison for having climbed atop the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor demanding that the U.S. put an end to those naval practices. 
¬† 
Now Tito Kayak rows in the Caribbean sea, to the first of the many islands in a journey expected to take a month and a half asking that the people join their voices in raising the demand for the freedom of Oscar Lopez Rivera and thus strengthening the bonds and building greater unity amongst those who believe and struggle for freedom and justice.

Prosecution
                           opposes the motion of Gerardo Hern·ndez July 9, 2012
Translation by freethefive.org
 

Garbus On July 6, 2012, the Florida prosecutor sent to the Miami court his opposition to the motion presented by 
attorney Martin Garbus, representing Gerardo Hern·ndez Nodelo, in which 
he asked for an oral hearing and delivery of additional 
evidence by the government which would permit deepening the issue of the journalists who were paid with Federal money and acted 
before and during the trial of the Five for the purpose of creating what the Appelate Court called a "perform storm of prejudice 
and hostility" in 2005.


 
In an evasive obviously move, the Government tries to argue that the facts presented by the 
defense are as they are and therefore it is not necessary to seek 
further information to clarify them. In other words, the 
prosecutor tells Judge Joan Lenard that the claim of the defense about 
the conduct of the "journalists" that she herself even 
admitted at trial managed to intimidate and harass the jury, is just a 
conspiracy theory and widespread speculation.

In its statement, the prosecutor warns that it could resort to "executive privilege" and the Law 
on Classified Information Protection Act (CIPA) for not acceding to the 
request, which is to admit their willingness to 
continue hiding and manipulating evidence.
In a brief final paragraph the Prosecutor also opposes the hearing requested by Gerardo.

One wonders what the Government fears. Why not allow the Five and particularly Gerardo, who is 
serving two life terms plus 15 years in prison, to have all the 
information they need to defend against the unjust and absurd 
sentences that were imposed on them.
[Ed. note: the defense is in the process of preparing a reply to the government's response}

Cuban 5 News/Updates


†U.S. BLOCKS CONSULAR AND LEGAL VISITS OF GERARDO HERNANDEZ NORDELO
†
 †††††† † 
Once again an additional punishment has been inflicted upon Gerardo HernandezNordelo, one of the Cuban 5 anti-terrorist fighters unjustly imprisoned in the United States for almost 14 years. On 
Saturday July 7 Cuban consuls† were not allowed to enter the prison† and on Monday July 9 his lawyer, Martin 
Garbus, was also denied a legal visit† having to resort instead to enter as a regular visitor. This meant that Garbus could not enter the prison with any legal documents for Gerardo's current 
appeal or any pens or writing paper.†
†
†
Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Cuba†
†
One of the five antiterrorist fighters unjustly 
imprisoned in the United States, Hero of the Republic of Cuba, Gerardo 
Hern·ndez Nordelo, has been subject† of a new 
arbitrariness by the authorities of that country, aiming at hindering 
his legal process.††  
Last Saturday, July 7th, the Cuban officers who had been already authorized 
by the State Department to carry out a consular 
visit to Gerardo, were not able to fulfill it, under the supposed 
argument that the memorandum of the Chief of the penitentiary 
center Victorville, in California, authorizing their entrance to the 
prison, was not available at the reception desk. This 
fact powerfully calls the attention† when, in addition to the procedures followed by the Cuban Interests Section in Washington 
with the State Department to get the authorization for this visit, 
Gerardo himself had reconfirmed with the prison¥s authorities that everything was in order.
†
Additionally, last July 9th, lawyer Martin Garbus, member of Gerardo¥s defense team, who had scheduled a legal visit to review, 
together with Gerardo, the documentation related to the current 
collateral process of appeal, was not able to do it with the 
same pretext that the memorandum of authorization of the chief of prison was not at the reception desk. Garbus could finally 
visit Gerardo, thanks to the fact that his name was on the visitor¥s 
list; however, and given the conditions imposed to the type 
of visit he was authorized to, without a legal character, he could not 
bring in the documentation our Hero should read and sign, and neither met with him under the appropriate conditions.††  
This is not the first time events like this one occur. They have taken place systematically during every key moment of Gerardo¥s legal 
process. Just to mention a few examples: in 2010, during the 
preparations of the collateral appeal, known as Habeas Corpus, 
the penitentiary authorities denied Gerardo the possibility to be 
visited by his lawyer Leonard Weinglass in two occasions, 
and deliberately delayed the delivery of his legal mail, which prevented his participation in the reviewing. In 2003, Gerardo was 
isolated in a punishment cell prior to the presentations of his direct 
appeal.
†
The Minister of Foreign Affairs denounces this new maneuver by US 
authorities, aiming at hindering Gerardo¥s process of appeal, 
depriving him from one of the few rights he has as a prisoner in the 
United States.††  
Gerardo has been sent to solitary confinement several times without 
justification; he¥s had repeated difficulties with his 
personal and legal mail; his wife, Adriana, has not been granted visa to visit him and they have not been able to conceive a 
child. During his long and unjust imprisonment, on charges for crimes he did not commit and have never been proved, his rights have been violated repeatedly.†
†
Cuba will not stop denouncing to the world these violations and will not 
cease the efforts to achieve the return to the Homeland of Gerardo and his other four brothers unjustly imprisoned and retained in the United States for almost 14 years.
†
Havana July 12th, 2012

Increased demand is the key factor for solving the economic crisis. Demand/(pricelevel*productivity) = employment

Full employment is achieved when (1) the demand = (full employment*productivity*pricelevel). The solution to the crisis is proper demand management, i.e. the condition (1) fulfilled. This mainly means increased demand by the people via increased purchasing power for ordinary men and women, managed by the central administration. This is Cogrips-policy. (The Keynesian policy with increased public consumption will not work.) With severe economic crisis this (Cogrips-policy) includes large funds financed by quantitative easing to finance the necessary increased demand by the people. A correct exchange rate for the currency is also a necessary part of proper demand management. All libertarians should join in this call for proper demand management, Cogrips-policy, i.e. (1) - NOW! Increased demand is the key factor for solving the economic crisis. Demand/(pricelevel*productivity) = employment. Source: WEC 24.07.2012.

May Day 2012 Manifesto by IWW

The fight against the unenlightened plutarchy and statism including ochlarchy, and for anarchy i.e. real democracy, continues world wide. It is more than five years since the financial crisis hit, followed rapidly by a larger economic crisis. The resulting shock added millions to the already teeming ranks of the jobless and threw millions more into precarious work. Many workers have lost good jobs and far too many have also lost the fundamental rights that went with them. 

There is only one cause of the crisis: lack of proper demand management. Proper demand management is more easy done in anarchy than archy, look to Norway, but anarchy is not necessary for proper demand management. The main player in demand management is the central administration be it anarchist or archist. The most efficient demand management is Cogrips-policy, see the WEC resolutions. We call for Cogrips-policy world wide for proper demand management and the end of the economic crisis. Source: International Workers of the World 28.04.2012.

AGAINST ECONOMIC CRISIS... 
ABOUT THE WEC 

The World Economic Council - WEC - was founded 01.05.2009 in Oslo. The practical administration of WEC is taken care of by the IIFOR staff and the secretariate of the Libertarian* International, mainly located in Oslo, Norway. The postal address is WEC P.O.B. 4777 Sofienberg N- 0506 Oslo - Norway. The purpose of WEC is to make advice to international media, mandated persons and people in general to a) solve economic crisis problems and b) achieve environmentally sustainable economic growth with full employment world wide, and c) support libertarian actions and dialog to achieve a) and b). The basis is the practical and theoretical framework presented at the links above, especially the General Theory of Economics, i.e. libertarian economics. The Web-page of WEC presents updated material related to a), b) and c), the newest on top. 

Cogrips-models and Cogrips-policy, rooted back to economical Nobel Prize winner and social-individualist anarchist Ragnar Frisch, see The unenlightened plutarchy with links, are an important part of the basis for WEC's analysis, advice and other actions. These models and policy are an efficient alternative to Keynes-models and the increasingly inefficient Keynesian economic policy of our time -- regarding optimal demand management broadly defined, against economic crisis and in general. The Keynes-paradigm is falling... Long live Cogrips-models and Cogrips policy! 

An economic-political system with significant unemployment is in general neither efficient, i.e. Pareto-optimal, nor fair, as defined by libertarians. Libertarian political economy includes efficient and fair solutions, with a.o.t. full employment and green/environmental issues fully taken into account. Theoretically, as a special case, the unenlightened plutarchy can have about full employment, but not in general and also looking at history and the longer run this case can be practically ruled out.

The libertarians and WEC are against, and do and support direct actions against top heavy societal pyramids, economical and/or political/administrative -- cut bureaucracy costs -- increase the demand of the people -- the people seen as a class as opposed to the superiors in rank and/or income -- for full employment -- against the unenlightend plutarchy of several systems, IMF, WB, euro and US $. Troubled economies in Europe should leave the euro and the Euro-zone, this will make proper demand management more easy. 

In general it must pay to work, for the people. More information about the fight against the unenlightened plutarchy - and for full employment, see especially No to euro - Full employment - Anarchist vs bureaucracy economics - IJA 1 (32), the WEC resolutions, The unenlightened plutarchy, The general theory of anarchist economics and International Workers of the World. More information about the best alternative to the unenlightened plutarchy, i.e. real democracy and horizontal organization, see System theory, Real democracy, Industrial organization and Horizontal organization - a brief survey.

The libertarians including WEC call for an end of the present mostly inefficient and unfair political economical situations world wide, and a steady and orderly movement of the societal, i.e. economic and political/administrative - systems towards real democracy, i.e. libertarian, and continued increased libertarian degree, see System theory - Chapter V. B.! A development towards real democracy and more of it must be done by the people's actions - more and more, i.e. act with dignity, use real matter of fact arguments and add weight behind via direct actions, including mass actions & industrial actions, and via organization, dialog and elections!

Keynes is out. Only Cogrips-policy can create full employment! 

Most of the OECD countries are ruled by the unenlightened plutarchy with economic depression. Keynes is out. Probably only Cogrips-models and -policy can create full employment in 2011-12-13! New York Times 07.01.2011 stated that "Slow job growth dims expectation of early revival" in USA, continuing "The year 2010 ended on a disappointing note, as the economy added just 103,000 jobs in December, suggesting that economic deliverance will not arrive with a great pop in employment. Signs still point to a long slog of a recovery, with the unemployment rate likely to remain above 8 percent -  it sits at 9.4 percent after Friday's report - at least through the rest of the president's four-year term... The unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey of households, fell from 9.8 percent in November, though a substantial part of that drop is caused by Americans leaving the work force." See NY-Times - Jobs?. 

WEC's unenlightened plutarchy scenario with forecasts for a.o.t. unemployment in 2010, see below, became approximately a reality in several of the OECD countries, say, in the Euro-zone at large, and in the USA. The official registered unemployment rates (based on surveys with statistical errors), were about 10% but would have been higher if discouraged people had not left the workforce. The real unemployment rates may thus be much higher than about 10 percent, perhaps about 12.5 percent in several OECD countries, as indicated by WEC. The OECD unemployment statistics mainly confirm this analysis of WEC and IIFOR, see OECD - Labour and unemployment statistics. The Anarchy of Norway had the lowest unemployment rate in Europe in 2010, mainly due to an economic policy compatible with Cogrips-models and Cogrips-policy. 

As mentioned, probably only Cogrips-models and -policy can create full employment in 2011-12-13, see the Basic ideas of Ragnar Frisch with links. Economic Nobel Prize winner Ragnar Frisch made the first attempts to create Cogrips-models and -policy, and todays' Cogrips-models and -policy are inspired by these works by Frisch. Cogrips-models and -policy are mainly compatible with libertarian economics, as opposed to bureaucracy economics, see, say, No to euro - Full employment - Libertarian vs bureaucracy economics - IJA 1 (32) and The general theory of libertarian economics. More information about the best alternative to the unenlightened plutarchy, i.e. real democracy and horizontal organization, see (click on) System theory , Real democracy , Horizontal industrial organization and Horizontal organization - a brief survey. It is time for Cogrips-models and -policy, and libertarian economics in general! Meanwhile the International Workers of the World calls for action against the unenlightened plutarchy. Theoretically, as a special case, the unenlightened plutarchy can have about full employment, but not in general and also looking at history and the longer run this case can be practically ruled out.

The real unemployment rate may be 40% higher than the official registered unemployment rate 
in 2011 and the difference may be increasing

The OECD, UN and national statistics first and foremost present the official registered unemployment rates. These numbers are per 2011 depressingly large, more than 5 percent -- indicating economic depression, in most OECD-countries. However especially in times of economic crisis, these figures most likely severely under-counts the true number of unemployed. For instance, the official registered unemployment rate doesn't count 1. those people who don't have a job and have given up looking for one, or 2. those who have found marginal part-time work but still can't make ends meet and are still looking for more work or a full-time job. Some countries present alternative measures of labor underutilization, such as USA. In the US these concepts include: 

1.1. Persons marginally attached to the labor force, i.e. those who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months. Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached, have given a job-market related reason for not currently looking for work. 

1.2. NB! However people that indicate that they want and are available for a job and not have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months, are not accounted for in the US statistics. This may be a significant number, since the crisis started in 2008, and this figure will most likely increase over time as long as the crisis lasts. IIFOR and WEC call those the long time discouraged workers. 

1.3. Per definition the real unemployment ratio = [(real labor force - real employment)/real labor force]100%. A crude estimate of the size of the real labor force is based on same percentage of the population between 16-67 years as the registered labor force in percent of the population between 16-67 years in good economic times, say, the average for 1998-2000. The real unemployment rate includes both the marginally attached and the long time discouraged workers. 

1.4. In USA the official unemployment rate was 8.8 percent in March 2011. Adding the marginally attached unemployed the rate was 10.3 percent, see US Bureau of Labor Statistics - Table A-15. However including the long time discouraged workers, the real unemployment rate may be, say, 12-13 percent for USA in March 2011, perhaps even more. This is a quite conservative estimate related to 1.3.. Thus the real unemployment rate in USA may very well be about 40 percent higher than the official registered unemployment rate in 2011, and may be increasing toward 60 percent higher in the next years. The percentage difference between the real unemployment rate and the official registered unemployment rate may perhaps be about the same in other OECD-countries, however this is mainly a question of further research, a.o.t. based on 1.3.. 

2. Persons employed part time for economic reasons, i.e. those who want and are available for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule. This is more a question of underemployment than unemployment. However adding those, but not  the long time discouraged workers, the underemployment rate was 15.7 percent in USA for March 2011. Adding the long time discouraged workers, the underemployment rate may be 17.5-18.5 per cent in USA for March 2011. Source: WEC 08.04.2011. 

Apropos G-20 Seoul: world export = import; correcting imbalances in 
trade will not solve the depression problem, a big hike in world total demand will

The 2010 G-20 Seoul Summit was the fifth meeting of the G-20 heads of government, to discuss the global financial system and the world economy. It took place in Seoul, South Korea on November 11-12, 2010. The headline issue was currency war and addressing trade imbalances. Leaders were generally unable to agree on key issues, with commentators noting the absence of the sense of unity that had been present at summits during the worse of the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said this particular summit was "more of a G20 debate than a G20 conclusion". More agreement on correcting trade balances would however not contributed significantly to solve the crisis: World export = import; correcting imbalances in trade will not solve the depression problem, a sufficient hike in world total demand will. Exporting the crisis will not solve the problem, only distribute the unemployment around the world. Source: WEC. 20.11.2010. 

The solution: Quantitative easing for the people - not the bureaucracy!

The USA (and also the Euro-countries seen all in all) is in deep economic depression with around 10 percent unemployment-ratio. The Federal Reserve in USA, the central bank, is in the autumn 2010 doing quantitative easing, i.e. creating fresh money, for the bureaucracy in the USA. The Fed is not directing the fresh money directly to the people, seen as a class as opposed to the superiors in rank and/or income [i.e. the bureaucracy broadly defined], and thus creating optimal increased demand by the people. The Fed's monetary policy type quantitative easing is thus bureaucracy economics, not anarchist economics. 

The fresh money from the Fed will probably a) partly fall into the well known "liquidity trap", b) partly create increased profitmargin to the bureaucracy, and inflation, especially later on (and thus be a "hidden tax"), c) partly be spent on too high, disoptimal, public consumption, may be with "crowding out" effects, etc. and thus not create an optimal increase in the demand from and for the people. 

The quantitative easing shold not be combined with traditional Keynesian monetary policy, but should be combined with libertarian fiscal and financial policy. Say, give a lump sum gift directly to the people, or cut taxes for the people, and similar. That will be consistent with anarchist economics. Stop the Fed's monetary policy type bureaucracy economics quantitative easing, it will not work optimal. Instead, in short: Quantitative easing for the people - not the bureaucracy!

The unenlightened plutarchy scenario is becoming a reality in the USA - Unfortunately Obama and USA don't follow the advice from the WEC and must face the music

Gloomy picture for the people in the USA. More Americans fell into foreclosure in July as a sour job market kept them from making payments, and banks took over homes at a near record pace. Registered unemployment held at 9.5 percent in July but would have been higher if discouraged people had not left the workforce. The real unemploymentrate may thus be much higher than 9.5 percent. Pessimism over the economy is rising and the grim mood could hurt both parties in the November 2 congressional elections, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday 11.08.2010. Almost two-thirds of Americans believe the economy will worsen before it gets better, up from 53 percent who felt that way in January, the poll found. 

Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed said the country is headed in the wrong direction, a percentage that has held steady in NBC/WSJ polling throughout the year. More than half of respondents said they disapprove of the way President Barack Obama is handling the economy. The poll also found Americans were split on Obama's overall job performance, with 48 percent saying they disapprove and 47 saying they approve. Unfortunately Obama and USA don't follow the advice from the WEC and must face the music. Sources: WEC, Reuters, IIFOR, AIIS, NBC News/Wall Street Journal.12.08.2010. 

G20 Finance Ministers risk tipping the global economy into a 'double-dip' depression

WEC and the International Workers of the World have attacked the outcome of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting in Busan, Korea, on 5 June. The G20 Finance Ministers said they were meeting at a 'critical juncture' to secure global recovery and address economic challenges and risks. They have failed on both counts. Their decisions risk undermining recovery, whilst they have failed to move forward the agenda for re-regulating financial markets.  

The message on the economic recovery represents a shift from the Finance Ministers' April meeting where they cautioned against premature withdrawal of stimulus measures. In Busan, the focus was on the importance of "sustainable public finances" and the need for many countries to "accelerate the pace of consolidation". The Finance Ministers' conclusions do not add up. Forecasts suggest that the global economy is still on life-support from public sector stimulus, yet the responsible of the public sectors are now calling for a shift from supporting jobs to cutting deficits that could push the global economy into a 'double-dip' depression. 

On financial reform, the Busan meeting failed to decide on what to do next. The Ministers could not even agree on principles for international taxation of banks and other financial institutions as called for by the IMF, much less the adoption of a financial transactions tax (FTT). Nor did they find minimum common ground for strengthening the Basel II Framework regulating bank loans. 

The Busan meeting constitutes a setback for the G20. In the meantime, it is working families who again and again are paying, and will continue to pay, for the consequences of greed and irresponsible risk-taking by bankers and financial speculators. The need for further action on jobs and re-regulating finance is the message the global labor movement will take to the G20 Leaders meeting in Toronto at the end of the month. The unenlightened plutarchy prevails. Sources: WEC, IWW and AIIS. 07.06.2010.

PS. 18.06.2010. Obama warns G20 leaders on budget cuts, BBC reports. Barack Obama has warned against cutting national debts too quickly as it would put economic recovery at risk. In a letter to G20 leaders, the US president said that while it was important to put in place "credible plans" to cut deficits, withdrawing economic stimulus early was dangerous. The leaders of the world's 20 leading economies are due to meet in Toronto on 26 June. Mr Obama said the priority of the meeting should be "to safeguard and strengthen the recovery". "Better late than never, Obama", the WEC comments. 

PPS. 27.06.2010. WEC supports the resolution "IWW protest against Toronto G20: The policy of a) the uninformed of real economics and b) bureaucracy economics", by the (click on:) International Workers of the World, etc. BBC 28.07.2010. reports: "G20 summit agrees on deficit cuts by 2013. Leaders at the G20 summit in Canada have agreed to cut national budget deficits while endeavouring to promote economic growth. Correspondents note that every major G20 country had already committed to halve deficits within three years. Host Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, said that despite these cuts, short-term economic stimulus measures would still be needed. Proposals for a global levy on banks have been dropped, Mr Harper said. Instead, that will be left to individual countries." The WEC declares that 1. with the policy of the G20 Toronto meeting, and 2. not proper demand management toward full employment as job no 1., 3. a double dip or continued economic depression is very likely. 

PPPS. 28.06.2010. Later BBC has updated their report, Harper is now quoted the following way: "Host Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister said short-term stimulus measures would be needed to get economies moving... The head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said focussing on budget deficits was oversimplifying the problem, because the situation differed from one country to another." A small improvement, the WEC comments, and also presents the most economic part, point 4, of the resolution "IWW protest against Toronto G20: The policy of a) the uninformed of real economics and b) bureaucracy economics" here:

"The Anarchist International and the International Workers of the World call for direct actions, i.e. demonstrations with dignity and without ochlarchy, against the authoritarian policy of the G8-G20 and for horizontal organization, i.e. socialism and autonomy, now and later. The IWW, AI and anarchists in general arrange, support and participate in direct actions, i.e. strikes, general strikes, rallies, etc., against the unenlightened plutarchy world wide, but are clearly - and fight - against ochlarchy and ochlarchists/ochlarchs and authoritarian tendencies in general!

The anarchists are against the State in the meaning of societal x-archy, where 'x' is a lot, but not 'an', and do and support direct actions against the State, i.e. top heavy societal pyramid, economical and/or political/administrative. Cut bureaucracy costs - increase the demand of the people - the people seen as a class as opposed to the superiors in rank and/or income - for full employment - against the unenlightend plutarchy of IMF, WB, euro and the Euro-zone, EU in general, and the G8 and G20 countries. 

The anarchists thus call for proper demand management now and later. In general it must pay to work, for the people. More information about the fight against the unenlightened plutarchy - and for full employment, see No to euro - Full employment - Anarchist vs bureaucracy economics - IJA 1 (32) , the WEC resolutions , The unenlightened plutarchy and The general theory of anarchist economics. More information about the best alternative to the unenlightened plutarchy, i.e. real democracy and horizontal organization, see (click on) System theory , Real democracy , Industrial organization and Horizontal organization - a brief survey. 

Associated Press reports 27.06.2010 about the G20 meeting: World leaders pledging to reduce global deficits. As global deficits equal global surplus, this is the same as doing away with surplus, and is the policy of a) the uninformed of real economics and b) bureaucracy economics. It is typical unenlightened plutarchy. This is counterproductive, especially when the world economy very likely is entering a double dip depression, and with about 10% unemployment in many countries, including USA and the Euro-zone. Economic depression is per definition equal to or more than 5% unemployment ratio. This is certainly not the right time for reducing surplus = deficits, but time for proper demand management. Mandated persons! Do it now! Especially, weakening the over-evaluated US $, the British £ and the Euro, i.e. the currencies of the main "deficit countries", is a good thing in the present situation, not the opposite."

Support the Cuban 5!! 
Due to the U.S. government's denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo has not seen his wife for 13 years.† Rene Gonzalez, who is currently on parole in Florida, was not able to see his wife until this year's visit to Cuba, when his brother Roberto Gonzalez passed away.† For the 13 years he was incarcerated she was never allowed to visit and still cannot see him in the U.S. while on parole!
†
Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity. The U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. 
†
The U.S. government's denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security. 
†
We are asking people to fax or mail out this letter to Ms. Navanetham Pillay, The NEW High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5's mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!

Message:


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Increased demand is the key factor for solving the economic crisis. Demand/(pricelevel*productivity) = employment

Full employment is achieved when (1) the demand = (full employment*productivity*pricelevel). The solution to the crisis is proper demand management, i.e. the condition (1) fulfilled. This mainly means increased demand by the people via increased purchasing power for ordinary men and women, managed by the central administration. This is Cogrips-policy. (The Keynesian policy with increased public consumption will not work.) With severe economic crisis this (Cogrips-policy) includes large funds financed by quantitative easing to finance the necessary increased demand by the people. A correct exchange rate for the currency is also a necessary part of proper demand management. All libertarians should join in this call for proper demand management, Cogrips-policy, i.e. (1) - NOW! Increased demand is the key factor for solving the economic crisis. Demand/(pricelevel*productivity) = employment. Source: WEC 24.07.2012.

May Day 2012 Manifesto by IWW

The fight against the unenlightened plutarchy and statism including ochlarchy, and for anarchy i.e. real democracy, continues world wide. It is more than five years since the financial crisis hit, followed rapidly by a larger economic crisis. The resulting shock added millions to the already teeming ranks of the jobless and threw millions more into precarious work. Many workers have lost good jobs and far too many have also lost the fundamental rights that went with them. 

There is only one cause of the crisis: lack of proper demand management. Proper demand management is more easy done in anarchy than archy, look to Norway, but anarchy is not necessary for proper demand management. The main player in demand management is the central administration be it anarchist or archist. The most efficient demand management is Cogrips-policy, see the WEC resolutions. We call for Cogrips-policy world wide for proper demand management and the end of the economic crisis. Source: International Workers of the World 28.04.2012.

Ad the G20 meeting in France 03-04.11.2011 and similar meetings and UN. WEC calls for a small global tax on international exchange and consentration on national demand growth world wide. Use cogrips-models and cogrips-policy for optimal demand management broadly defined. Source: WEC 03.11.2011.

Anarchy and anarchism mean "system and management without ruler(s), i.e. co-operation without repression, tyranny and slavery". 
Anarchism is, a. o. t., based on dialog and free, matter of fact, criticism. Feel free to send us a comment: Contact AIIS - Click here!

In the mostly Orwellian "1984" newspeaking, lying, world, the following lies are also significant:
In USA, the world's largest economy, economical plutarchy, i.e. capitalism, is falsely called economic freedom! 
In China, the country with most people in the world, a totalitarian oligarchy is falsely called the people's democracy! 
And there are much more Orwellian "1984" newspeak type lies in the world - many of these lies are revealed and unmasked at www.anarchy.no!
Be enlightened and prepared for real democracy, i.e. anarchy, feel free to study all at www.anarchy.no!

The truth: the only Anarchies, i.e. anarchist countries in the world, are Norway, The Swiss Confederation and Iceland, 
and they are only anarchies of rather low degree...

And, say, Somalia, as the newspeaking lie-machines CNN, BBC, Foxnews, Reuters, Associated Press, Wikipedia and most of Internet in general, etc. 
falsely call 'anarchy' is in reality an ochlarchy with rivaling polyarchy, i.e. chaos - not anarchy, and the country most far from anarchy in the world! 
In general, x-archy, where x can be anything but not 'an', is the opposite of freedom and real democracy. 

www.anarchy.no has practically certain truths and likely truths, i.e. real scientific non-rejected hypothesis!
Most of so called social sciences and newsmedia represent false ideology, propaganda, manufactured consent, lies and more lies! 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thousands of anarchists world wide have contributed to the www.anarchy.no.
The www.anarchy.no is independent and autonomous, financed by anarchists and not by capitalist commercials or state-subsidies. 
The www.anarchy.no has for the time being about 15 000 visitors and 50 000 hits per month.

VICENTE FELIU

A Leading Voice of the Cuban Nueva Trova Movement 
¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬† 
The Nueva Trova Movement is a distinct musical tradition that emerged in Cuba in the early 1960's heavily influenced by the events surrounding the Cuban Revolution in 1959. One of these singer songwriters is Vicente Feliu who has performed in more than 20 countries in the Americas, Europe and Africa. He has shared the stage with numerous other Cuban musicians from the same movement including Silvio Rodr√≠guez and Pablo Milan√©s. He has also performed with Luis Eduardo Aute and Caco Senante (Spain), Isabel Parra and Inti Illimani (Chile), Le√≥n Gieco and Mercedes Sosa (Argentina), Jackson Browne, Pete Seeger, Holly Near and Little Steven (United States), Daniel Viglietti and Alfredo Zitarrosa (Uruguay), and Luis Enrique and Carlos Mej√≠a Godoy (Nicaragua). Currently he directs the cultural center Canto de Todos that promotes musical gatherings and exchanges between the countries of Latin America. ¬†

Due to the U.S. government‚Äôs denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity. The U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. 
The U.S. government‚Äôs denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security. 
¬†
We are asking people to fax or mail out this letter to Ms. Navanetham Pillay, The NEW High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5‚Äôs mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!!

In the mostly Orwellian "1984" newspeaking, lying, world, the following lies are also significant:
In USA, the world's largest economy, economical plutarchy, i.e. capitalism, is falsely called economic freedom! 
In China, the country with most people in the world, a totalitarian oligarchy is falsely called the people's democracy! 
And there are much more Orwellian "1984" newspeak type lies in the world - many of these lies are revealed and unmasked at www.anarchy.no!
Be enlightened and prepared for real democracy, i.e. anarchy, feel free to study all at www.anarchy.no!

The truth: the only Anarchies, i.e. anarchist countries in the world, are Norway, The Swiss Confederation and Iceland, 
and they are only anarchies of rather low degree...

And, say, Somalia, as the newspeaking lie-machines CNN, BBC, Foxnews, Reuters, Associated Press, Wikipedia and most of Internet in general, etc. 
falsely call 'anarchy' is in reality an ochlarchy with rivaling polyarchy, i.e. chaos - not anarchy, and the country most far from anarchy in the world! 
In general, x-archy, where x can be anything but not 'an', is the opposite of freedom and real democracy. 

www.anarchy.no has practically certain truths and likely truths, i.e. real scientific non-rejected hypothesis!
Most of so called social sciences and newsmedia represent false ideology, propaganda, manufactured consent, lies and more lies! 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thousands of anarchists world wide have contributed to the www.anarchy.no.
The www.anarchy.no is independent and autonomous, financed by anarchists and not by capitalist commercials or state-subsidies. 
The www.anarchy.no has for the time being about 15 000 visitors and 50 000 hits per month.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \FREE MARKET: TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS, 
Dr. Manuel Cereijo, P.E.
The free market is the most transformative of economic systems. It fosters creativity and inventiveness. It produces new industries, products, and services, as it improves upon existing ones. The free market creates more wealth and opportunities for more people than any other economic model.
The free market promotes self-worth, self-sufficiency, shared values, and honest dealings, which enhance the individual, the family, the community. The free market is an intricate system of voluntary economic, social, and cultural interactions that are motivated by the desires and needs of the individual and the community. 
The key to understanding the free market is PRIVATE PROPERTY. Private property is the material manifestation of the individual‚Äôs labor-the material value created from the intellectual and/or physical labor of the individual, which may take the form of income, real property, or intellectual property. The free market is a mutable, dynamic, and vibrant system of individual interactions that engages all aspects of the human character.
The free market is the only economic system that produces on a sustainable basis an abundance of food, housing, energy, and medicine-the staples of human survival. It creates an astronomical array of consumer goods that add comfort, value, and security to the quality of life. The free market recognizes that it is in man‚Äôs nature to take risks, to innovate, to achieve, to compete, and to acquire, not only to survive but also to improve his circumstance.
The individual knows better how to make and spend that which he has earned from his own labor and provide for his family than do large bureaucracies populated by strangers who see classes of people rather than individual human beings.
The government does not add value to the economy. It removes value from the economy by imposing taxes on one citizen and providing cash to another. Or it borrows money that would otherwise cash to another. Or it prints more money and threatens the value of the dollar. The best way to stimulate the economy would be for the federal government to slash capital gain taxes, corporate income taxes, and individual income tax rates.
Property is the fruit of labor, property is desirable, is a positive good in the world. That some be rich shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another. Let him labor diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built.
Parents and grandparents must take it upon themselves to reach their children and grandchildren to believe in and appreciate the principles of freedom, free market, and stress the import of preserving and improving society. This can be accomplished by conferring their knowledge, beliefs, and ideals on them over the dinner table, in the car, at family reunions.
We should not endorse the politics of envy and division.

For 14 years, the Cuban 5 have suffered physical and psychological torture!¬† They have been denied visitation from friends and family; have been placed in solitary confinement; and been mistreated by prison officials!¬† This injustice must end now!

Happy 70th Birthday Avelino!






Who is Avelino Gonzalez Claudio?


In August of 1985, Avelino Gonz√°lez Claudio was accused of participating in the planning and authorization of an operation to secure $7,117,000 from a Wells Fargo armored truck in 
Hartford, Connecticut on September 12, 1983, along with 
other Puerto Ricans and two North Americans. The operation was carried 
out by a clandestine organization fighting for the 
independence of Puerto Rico, the PRTP-Macheteros. Avelino was not 
arrested at the time. However, more than 20 years later, he was 
arrested in Manat√≠¬≠, Puerto Rico, on February 7, 2008.

Avelino was born in the town of Vega Baja on October 8, 1942. As a student at the University of 
Puerto Rico, he became a member and then vice-president of the 
Pro-Independence University Federation (Federaci√≥n Universitaria Pro Independencia-FUPI). In the mid-1960‚Äôs, he married and moved to New York City, earning his living on Wall Street, 
and working with the Puerto Rican community, joining and then leading 
the Vito Marcantonio Mission of the Movemiento 
Pro-Independencia (MPI) in New York. He and his family of four children 
returned to Puerto Rico, where he worked in the independence 
movement, including administering the political journal Pensamiento 
Cr√≠¬≠tico (Critical Thought).

When the arrests of 1985 took place, and Avelino was not arrested, he assumed the identity of Jos√© 
Ortega, and, while the FBI pursued him, he lived a quiet life, working 
as a computer teacher to support his family and 
contributing constructively to his nation, seeking to improve the 
services provided by the Department of Education.

The charges against those arrested in 1985 had various results: Carlos Ayes, Filiberto Ojeda, Juan 
Segarra, Norman Ramirez and Roberto Maldonado went to trial in 1989; 
Ivonne Mel√©ndez Carri√≥n also went to trial‚Äîsome were 
acquitted, others convicted and sentenced to terms ranging from one year to 55 years; while Orlando Gonz√°lez, Hilton Fern√°ndez 
Diamante, Jorge A. Farinacci, Isaac Camacho, El√≠¬≠as Castro and Angel 
D√≠as Ruiz negotiated a plea agreement in 1992. They were 
sentenced to terms of five years in prison. Two others have never been 
arrested: Avelino‚Äôs brother Norberto and Victor Gerena, 
and are being sought by the FBI.

Avelino is currently being held in Ashland, Kentucky far from his family and his nation,¬† He was 
sentenced to 7 years and should be returning home in 2013!

FREE THE CUBAN 5 MONTH (SEPT. 12TH-OCT. 12TH)
OCTOBER 12TH CUBAN 5 CALL IN DAY!




The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 is asking all freedom loving people to call President Obama on Friday October 12th, 2012 to ask him to free the Cuban 5; five U.S. held political prisoners incarcerated for 14 years for fighting against terrorism in Cuba and the United States.
†
Let President Obama know that for 14 years these innocent men have been separated from their families and friends. Tell him that he has the power to reunite these men with their loved ones!
†
Ask your friends and family members to call in as well! Thousands of messages will let President Obama know that there is a mass movement calling for the freedom of these five men!
†
Call President Obama at 202-456-1111!
†
Sample Script (optional):

This message is for President Obama, I ask that you use your executive power to free the Cuban 5. For 14 years, the Cuban 5 have been unjustly incarcerated for protecting their homeland Cuba and the United States from terrorist actions.

They have the support of various reputable actors, academics and civil rights leaders, such as: Danny Glover, Harry Belafonte, Cindy Sheehan and Angela Davis. As well as the support of thousands of people throughout the United States and the world.† Only you have the power to set these men free! Please end this long standing injustice by sending these men home.† Thank you!

Paddling Across the Caribbean for Freedom
and Justice in Puerto Rico
The Prisoner and the Kayaker
by CARMELO RUIZ-MARRERO

http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/10/19/the-prisoner-and-the-kayaker/

The Prisoner

An unusual and very original political act. An athletic milestone. A
feat of endurance. A hazardous journey. These and many other words have
been used to describe the maritime journey of Puerto Rican
environmental and human rights activist Alberto De Jes√∫s ‚ÄúTito Kayak‚Äù
through the Caribbean Antilles last summer. At dawn on solstice day,
June 21, De Jes√∫s departed in a kayak from Venezuela‚Äôs Paria Peninsula
towards the island of Grenada, thus beginning his journey of over 1,000
nautical miles to Puerto Rico.



De Jes√∫s, who does not look his 54 years of age, did not undertake
this extraordinary journey to wow and impress people- although he
definitely succeeded at that. He was on a political mission, a seaborne
crusade for freedom, and he has pointed that out in every opportunity,
be it press interview or personal conversation. De Jes√∫s kayaked the
Caribbean to call attention to and gather international support for the
release of Oscar L√≥pez-Rivera, a Puerto Rican who has been incarcerated
in the US for 31 years.



Oscar‚Äôs supporters refer to him in different ways. Some call him a
political prisoner, others a prisoner of war, or jailed patriot, or
anti-colonial warrior. He¬†was convicted in 1981 for ‚Äúseditious
conspiracy‚Äù. Specifically, he was charged with belonging to the Armed
Forces of National Liberation (FALN), a clandestine¬†Puerto
Rican¬†pro-independence group that engaged in armed struggle in the
Chicago and New York areas in the 1970‚Ä≤s. However, he was not convicted
of any specific act by the organization. This 69 year-old man, who was
not even accused of one single act of violence, is serving a de facto
life sentence, much longer than sentences handed out to convicted
murderers and rapists. His next parole hearing will be fifteen years
from now. De Jes√∫s is calling on the peoples and governments of the
Caribbean and Latin America to join the call for Oscar‚Äôs release,
freedom now.



Since the US invaded Puerto Rico in 1898, repression and persecution
against Puerto Ricans on the basis of political beliefs has been
constant and relentless. It has spanned from police and FBI
surveillance, infiltration and disruption of lawful and peaceful¬†independentista¬†organizations and campaigns, to outright assassination. To name just two of the most
outrageous examples of the latter: On Easter Sunday 1937 local police,
under orders from US-appointed governor Blanton Winship, slaughtered a
peaceful Nationalist march in the streets of Ponce city, killing 19 and
wounding around 150, Puerto Rico‚Äôs own Bloody Sunday.



And in September 2005, FBI agents- with the assistance of local
police- murdered¬†independentista¬†leader Filiberto Ojeda-Rios,
head of the clandestine group Los Macheteros, in his house in the town
of Hormigueros. The autopsy determined that he died from lack of
medical attention. The image of flak-vested FBI agents gloating over
Ojeda-Rios as he gasped his last breath burns in the heart and
consciousness of every patriotic Puerto Rican. ¬†To add insult to
injury, the FBI chose to carry out the assassination on September 23, a
date that is sacred in the Puerto Rican calendar, for it is the
anniversary of the 1868 Grito de Lares, the nation‚Äôs first uprising for
independence and freedom. No Puerto Rican believes that the FBI chose
the date of September 23 at random.



The US government‚Äôs criminal acts against Puerto Rico‚Äôs
self-determination and its people‚Äôs freedom of expression are too many
to mention here, and are way beyond the scope of this article. All
these acts remain unpunished in the courts- the empire does not judge
its own actions. No US government personnel ever did time for the Ponce
massacre or for the killing of Ojeda-Rios, or for the mysterious death
of¬†independentista¬†activist Angel Rodr√≠guez-Crist√≥bal in 1979
in Tallahassee federal prison while doing time for a non-violent
protest in the sandy beaches of Vieques island against the US Navy
presence there. Rodr√≠guez-Crist√≥bal, a Socialist League member from the
town of Ciales, allegedly committed suicide right before the end of his
sentence. Whereas¬†independentista¬†activists are severely
punished by the US courts for both real and imaginary acts, US federal
and state law enforcement agents and intelligence operatives have a
get-out-of-jail-free card.



But Puerto Rico is no passive victim. This Caribbean nation has a
centuries-long tradition of struggle- both peaceful and not so
peaceful- against colonialism, dating all the way back to the Taino
resistance against the Spanish conquest, going through the 19th¬†century
Grito de Lares, and the mid-20th¬†century Nationalist
resistance and Communist labor organizing, and all the way to the armed
actions of the FALN and Los Macheteros, and¬†independentista¬†participation in local labor and environmental struggles. Most Americans who know
anything about Puerto Rico know about the 1950 attempt on US president
Truman‚Äôs life, and the armed attack against the US Congress four years
later, both acts committed by members of the Puerto Rico Nationalist
Party.¬†For over 110 years of US colonialism, there has not been a
moment in which the invader has not encountered resistance. In its
Resolution 1514, the United Nations recognizes the absolute right of
colonized peoples to fight against colonialism and for their
independence and self-determination.



Most Americans who know something about the FALN do so because of
the bombing of Fraunces Tavern in southern Manhattan on January 24
1975. The tavern was- and still is- a classy bar-hangout for New York
City‚Äôs upper crust- what we now call the 1%- where in 1783 George
Washington bade farewell to his troops after the end of the
Revolutionary War. The bomb that went off that day killed four and
wounded tens of others. It is not easy to talk in a neutral way about a
bombing that took place just a few blocks away from the World Trade
Center. But if we don‚Äôt, then right-wing pundits will, adding their own
particular and convenient ideological spin. Every time Oscar is up for
parole, right-wing campaigners linked to law enforcement agencies take
relatives of the bombing‚Äôs victims to the parole board and to the media
to speak up against his release. But they tend not to mention one
significant fact: he is not in prison because of the Fraunces Tavern
bombing. In fact, no one is. Nobody was ever convicted or even
prosecuted for that act. Oscar is not in prison for any violent action.



Another unmentioned fact is that, according to a FALN communique,
the Fraunces Tavern attack was in retaliation for a bombing that took
place in Puerto Rico two weeks earlier. On the eleventh of that month,
a bomb went off in a public activity of the independence movement in
the town square of the city of Mayag√ºez. Two people were killed:
socialist activist Angel Luis Charbonier, and Eddie Rom√°n, a bystander.
To this day, no one has done time or been prosecuted for this act,
although the independence movement has some pretty good leads as to the
specific identities of those behind the bombing. These leads have been
presented to the Puerto Rico Justice Department, which has done nothing
with them.



It is not my intention to either justify or repudiate what happened
in Fraunces Tavern, but rather to give an appropriate context for
understanding it. But, as Noam Chomsky has repeatedly told us:¬†if you
try to start a rational discussion of terrorism you get accused of
being an apologist for terrorism, or worse. One has to ask, how many
Americans who know about Fraunces Tavern ever heard of the bombing in
Mayag√ºez? Acts of violence committed¬†against¬†the Puerto Rico
independence movement are not part of the official narrative. They are
forgotten and sent down the Orwellian memory hole.¬†The Mayag√ºez attack
was no anomalous isolated incident. It was part of a violent spree of
bombings, arson and assassination against the independence movement
that lasted throughout the decade of the seventies, thouroughly
documented by the local press but ignored by the American media. Even
most American progressives know nothing about this bloody history.



Most of the men and women who were arrested along with Oscar were
released in 1999. He is the only one that remains in prison. He has
spent more time behind bars than any other Puerto Rican¬†independentista¬†ever
did. Longer than Mandela, almost as long as Leonard Peltier.



No conflict between nations or civil war is over without there being
a prisoner exchange between the warring parties. In the colonial case
of Puerto Rico, only one side holds prisoners. The release of Oscar, as
well as of the other two Puerto Rican political prisoners, the
Gonzalez-Claudio brothers, is therefore an essential prerequisite for
this Caribbean nation‚Äôs freedom and full self-determination.




The Kayaker
When I first saw Alberto de Jes√∫s‚Äô daredevil protests on local
television, I was reminded of the 1985 film¬†Turk 182, in which
Timothy Hutton plays a graffiti avenger that repeatedly makes a fool of
New York City‚Äôs mayor and eludes all of the city police‚Äôs attempts to
capture him. De Jes√∫s, whom we all call ‚ÄúTito Kayak‚Äù, represents a new
breed of activist, one that combines originality, style and
extraordinary courage. He could be a professor emeritus at the Ruckus
Society and also teach the folks at Greenpeace and Code Pink a thing or
two about penetrating security perimeters, hanging banners from unusual
places, and pulling off incredible escapes.


In 1999 De Jes√∫s made history by camping out alone in the US Navy
firing range in Vieques with the aim of putting an end once and for all
to the war games and target practice that had gone on there nonstop
since World War Two. At first, people called him insane, but his
insanity caught on. Half a dozen people joined him, then dozens. The
protest went on for weeks, then months. More camps were set up by
political parties, labor unions, churches, and¬†independentista¬†organizations, and the whole affair snowballed into a phenomenon that turned Puerto
Rican society upside down, and even received support from activists in
the US and other lands, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Rigoberta
Mench√∫, to name just two. In May 2000, federal authorities raided the
camps and arrested hundreds, but the protesters failed to quit.


In November 2000, De Jes√∫s, with the cooperation of about a dozen
supporters, got on top of the Statue of Liberty and hung a ‚ÄúPeace for
Vieques‚Äù banner from her head. This was a repeat of an almost identical
action taken in October 1977, when activists draped a Puerto Rican flag
on Lady Liberty‚Äôs forehead as they called on the Carter administration
to free the Nationalist prisoners which had been in jail since the
1950‚Ä≤s. The campaign eventually succeeded, and in 1979 the last
Nationalists in prison received a presidential pardon and were received
as heroes in Puerto Rico.


When they saw him on top of the Statue of Liberty in 2000, US law
enforcement authorities saw their chance to put De Jes√∫s away- they
were just aching for the opportunity¬†to make an example of this real
life Turk 182.¬†At that time he happened to be under probation after
having been repeatedly arrested in Vieques. He spent a year in
Manhattan Correctional for violating his probation. For one year, both
De Jes√∫s and Oscar were prisoners of the USA.


In September of the following year, two jet liners crashed into the
World Trade Center, only three or four blocks away from where De Jes√∫s
was doing time. Many activists feared that the 9-11 attacks, with their
inevitable sequel of repression and war, would be the end for the
Vieques movement. But that turned out not to be the case. After the
initial horror and shock, the protesters regrouped and regained the
initiative.¬†And four years after De Jes√∫s‚Äô lone stand in the firing
range the impossible happened: the Pentagon got fed up with the never
ending protests and left Vieques. Nonviolent protesters had routed the
world‚Äôs most powerful naval force. It was a gigantic victory for
anti-colonial forces and peace-loving people all over the world. The
Puerto Rican people thus have an enormous debt of gratitude to Tito
Kayak.
But he did not rest after that. He continues his work for ecology
and human rights, both locally and internationally. De Jes√∫s had first
become a public figure in the late 1990‚Ä≤s through his direct actions
against the passage of ships carrying reprocessed nuclear waste between
France and Japan through Caribbean waters. In 2000 he traveled to
Japan, where he was hosted by anti-nuclear activists and had the
opportunity to express his concerns to the Japanese authorities, which
of course did not heed him. In 2007 de Jes√∫s hung a banner from the Las
Am√©ricas bridge, which crosses over the Panam√° Canal, to protest the
interoceanic traffic in nuclear waste. The nuclear horror of Fukushima
in 2011 proved De Jes√∫s right.


Also in 2007 he went to the West Bank to express his solidarity with
the Palestinian people. During his visit he climbed up the Wall of
Infamy being built by the Israeli state and put up a Palestinian flag
on top, in plain sight of baffled and flabbergasted Israeli snipers.
Tito knew full well the danger he was taking on, and had no illusions
that his US citizenship would shield him from Israel‚Äôs murderous
military. The cold-blooded murder of US activist Rachel Corrie by the
Israeli Defense Forces four years earlier was fresh in the minds of
everyone who accompanied him that day.


Tito Kayak has done this and so much more, so many other actions
that deserve at least a passing mention, from death-defying stunts to
protest successive Puerto Rican governments‚Äô neoliberal policies, and
standing tall against police brutality in the months-long 2010-2011
University of Puerto Rico student strike, to speaking to school
children about the importance of recycling and environmental
protection, and forming groups to clean up litter in beaches. All these
actions and feats, both great and small, have earned him great esteem
from the Puerto Rican people- except from some lumpen elements who have
nothing but smoldering contempt for him, some of whom openly declared
on Twitter that they wish he had sank and drowned in his kayak during
his Antilles trip.


There is a certain mystique that surrounds the figure of De
Jes√∫s/Tito Kayak that fascinates his admirers and enrages his derisive
critics. Just who is he? Local right-wing newspapers, such as¬†El
Vocero¬†and¬†Caribbean Business, allege that Tito Kayak‚Äôs
finances are a mystery, and have even hinted at funding from Hugo
Ch√°vez. But his life is a mystery only to wannabe journalists who do
not bother to do basic research. Alberto De Jes√∫s is a working class
man, a blue collar hardhat who makes a living as an electrician. He is
not a man of long speeches, in fact he has not given many speeches in
his life. He is not a writer, although he is certainly a reader. Upon
first meeting him, people are amazed that this leftist boogeyman, this
international troublemaker, is actually a regular guy, an unpretentious
everyman who loves a good beer and hanging out with friends as much as
the next guy.


The kayak trip through the Antilles, with all its hazards and
hardships, was all for Oscar. Even though imprisoned in the USA, his
presence was very tangible and real in the Caribbean. He was the real
protagonist all along. In solidarity with Puerto Rico‚Äôs
self-determination and in the spirit of anti-imperialist Latin American
unity, Venezuela‚Äôs government joined the call for Oscar‚Äôs freedom and
gave concrete support to Tito Kayak‚Äôs trip. The Venezuelan Navy fleet,
the diplomatic corps and state media- particularly Telesur, La Radio
del Sur and the CCS Caracas newspaper- provided critical support.


In early July, Venezuela hosted the 18th meeting of the
Foro de Sao Paulo, an umbrella organization that brings together much
of the Latin American left. The Puerto Rican delegation, composed of
the Nationalist Party, the Socialist Front and the Movimiento
Independentista Nacional Hostosiano (This organization‚Äôs name defies
translation), intended to garner international support for the nation‚Äôs
anti-colonial struggles.


The effort was successful as Puerto Rico‚Äôs colonial case was
mentioned in the meeting‚Äôs final statement, the Caracas Declaration:



‚ÄúLeft-wing parties gathered in the Forum and all social movements
are responsible to deploy all initiatives within our reach so as to
turn the issue of Puerto Rico‚Äôs independence into a central item in the
United Nations agenda. It is unthinkable that in the 21st century there
are still colonial enclaves in our region and the world. We join in the
demand for the release from prison of Puerto Rican political detainee
Oscar L√≥pez-Rivera, incarcerated in US prisons for 31 years now, whose
sole ‚Äúcrime‚Äù was fighting for his land‚Äôs independence.‚Äù
>
We do not doubt that Tito Kayak‚Äôs lobbying activities in Venezuela
prior to his departure the previous month, his media outreach and his
rapport with the Venezuelan people, had a lot to do with our success in
getting Oscar mentioned in the Caracas declaration.


In mid-September, Tito finally arrived in Puerto Rico, ending his
epic voyage by landing in a protest encampment set up in Isla Verde
beach, near the international airport (http://pr.indymedia.org/news/2012/09/52681.php). The camp was set up in 2005 by Tito and other concerned citizens,
organized as Playas Pal Pueblo (Beaches for the People), to physically
obstruct the illegal invasion of the public Isla Verde beach by
high-rise hotels, and to call attention to other equally harmful and
illegal encroachments of hotels and other private developments in
Puerto Rico‚Äôs beaches. The story of this camp, continuously occupied
for seven years, where protesters have set up organic gardens and solar
panels under the constant threat of eviction by the police, is one of
the great underreported tales of this Caribbean nation.


Looking back on those three months of danger and extreme endurace-
with obstacles ranging from searing sun and treacherous currents to
seemingly insurmountable funding and logistics challenges- Tito winces
and describes the whole undertaking as a nightmare. But the real
nightmare is the one that Oscar has been experiencing for 31 years.
Freedom for Oscar. Freedom Now.

FRIENDS OF PROLIBERTAD



Support the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners! Oscar Lopez Rivera, Avelino GonzalezClaudio, and Norberto GonzalezClaudio!


Dear ProLibertad Supporters,

New¬† ProLibertad t-shirts...new protest banners...new campaign posters...as we begin this holiday season, we are thinking about how we can broaden the movement to free our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners in the new year!

With every new year comes a sense of much possibility.¬† We are sure this coming year will be a powerful and decisive time for our work to free Oscar Lopez Rivera, Avelino Gonzalez Claudio and Norberto Gonzalez Claudio; we are beginning to do all of the necessary planning to make this happen.¬† 
¬†¬† 
With that in mind, we are launching the ‚ÄúFriends of ProLibertad‚Äù initiative. The ‚ÄúFriends of ProLibertad‚Äù is¬† a¬† network of supporters that will help us reach our goal of $5000 for 2012.¬† A minimum donation of $25 from our supporters will help us purchase a new campaign banner for protests and activities; print new high gloss brochures for distribution; re-launch a professional¬†¬† website; make an updated campaign t-shirt; and cover the costs of the venues we use for public¬†¬†¬†¬† activities.

For 17 years, ProLibertad has worked diligently to build the movement to free the Puerto¬† Rican Political Prisoners with the support of our contributors.¬† As we enter this¬†¬†¬† holiday season and new year, we have high hopes of modernizing our outreach tools, creating new fund-raising¬† opportunities and creating a network of support that will help us reach that¬† inevitable day when Oscar, Avelino and Norberto walk free in their homeland, Puerto Rico.
¬† 
Your support means so much; it helps us make freedom happen.¬† Your support will reunite Oscar, Avelino and Norberto with their families and friends.¬† These Prisoners of¬†¬† Colonialism have suffered enough and it is time for them to come home!.¬† They should not have to spend any more holidays and New Year‚Äôs Days behind the prison walls of this empire.

Thank you in advance for your donation.¬† We look forward to sending you regular updates on our work and seeing you at our activities in 2012.


Sincerely Yours,

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign

Norberto Gonzalez Claudio, Puerto Rican Nationalist Gets 5 Years In Robbery

By MICHAEL MELIA 11/14/12 03:22 PM ET EST , Huffington Post
 

HARTFORD, Conn. -- A 67-year-old man was sentenced Wednesday to five 
years in prison for his role in a record-breaking, $7 million robbery 
carried out in Connecticut nearly 30 years ago by a militant group 
dedicated to independence for Puerto Rico.


Norberto Gonzalez Claudio, who helped plan the 1983 heist as a leader
 of Los Macheteros, was captured by the FBI last year in Puerto Rico and
 pleaded guilty in June. The graying nationalist said through a Spanish 
interpreter in U.S. District Court in Hartford that nothing is more 
important to him than his family.


"I would like to be with my family as soon as possible," he said.


The sentencing of Gonzalez brings the U.S. government as close as it 
may ever get to resolving the crime: The only remaining fugitive in the 
case, alleged stickup man Victor Gerena, is believed to be living in 
Cuba, outside the reach of American law enforcement.


The first indictment was delivered in 1985 and a total of 19 
defendants were charged including Gonzalez's older brother, Avelino, who
 was sentenced in 2010 to seven years in prison after spending more than
 two decades as a fugitive. A third brother, Orlando, was also convicted
 of taking part in the robbery and was among family members in the 
courtroom Wednesday to support Norberto.


"This is kind of an end of an era for this district," defense attorney Richard Reeve said.


Norberto Gonzalez has been detained since he was arrested in May 2011
 in the central island town of Cayey, where he had been living under a 
false name. U.S. authorities said he still had an active role in the 
Macheteros, which claimed responsibility for robberies, murders and 
bombings in the 1970s and `80s.


In June, he pleaded guilty to foreign transportation of stolen money,
 conspiracy to rob federally insured bank funds and illegal weapons 
possession.


His wife, Elda Santiago, said that Gonzalez is happy because he feels
 he is going to prison in the name of independence for Puerto Rico.


"He feels he is completing his patriotic duty," she said after the hearing.


Gonzalez was also sentenced to pay restitution of not less than $250 a
 month toward the stolen $7.1 million. The U.S. government has not 
recovered any of the stolen money, which authorities believe was used to
 finance bombings and attacks in the militant group's push for 
independence.


The brazen holdup of the Wells Fargo depot on Sept. 12, 1983, in West
 Hartford, was the largest cash robbery in U.S. history at the time.


Authorities say it was carried out by Gerena, a Wells Fargo driver 
recruited by the Macheteros. He allegedly took two co-workers hostage at
 gunpoint, handcuffed them and injected them with an unknown substance 
to temporarily disable them. Gerena is one of the FBI's 10 Most Wanted 
fugitives, and the FBI is offering a reward of $1 million for 
information leading to his arrest.


"Justice in this case is not yet absolute and will not be until 
Victor Gerena, the alleged mastermind of the Wells Fargo robbery, is 
captured and himself brought to justice," said Kimberly Mertz, special 
agent in charge of the FBI in Connecticut.

The
American Studies Association, a progressive educational organization,¬†
met last weekend in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Panels included the
participation of former Puerto Rican political prisoners Rafael Cancel
Miranda, Elizam Escobar, Lucy Rodriguez, and Luis Rosa. Following is a
statement written to the conference by Oscar Lopez Rivera:

 
For
the American Studies Association conference
 
October 29, 2012
¬†
The U.S. government categorically denies it has
political
prisoners in its gulags. It does it primarily to cover up the
nefarious,
barbaric and even criminal acts and practices it carries out against us
and
other regular prisoners, and to do it with impunity. It uses the denial
as its
license to violate our most basic human rights by subjecting us to
isolation
and sensory deprivation regimens that are nothing less than cruel and
unusual
punishment. It uses it to hoodwink its own citizens to believe that it
doesn‚Äôt
criminalize dissenters or opponents of its wars and other imperialistic
practices. It does it to perpetuate the lie that it‚Äôs the ultimate
defender of
freedom, justice, democracy and human rights in the world. And it uses
it at
times to further criminalize the political prisoners and/or our
families and to
disconnect us from our families, communities, supporters and the just
and noble
causes we served and try to continue serving.
¬†
During the many years I‚Äôve been in the gulags,
I‚Äôve met
and shared ideas, time and space with different political prisoners who
struggle for just and noble causes like the one I‚Äôve chosen to serve.
Some were
with me at USP Leavenworth, where we were labeled ‚Äúnotorious and
incorrigible
criminals‚Äù and targeted by the FBI, jailers and informants/provocateurs
in
their attempts to criminalize us further. In my case the same evil
forces even
used my medical condition as fodder for the escape conspiracy plot they
hatched
that added fifteen more years to my sentence.
¬†
There were political prisoners with me at USP
Marion,
where we were subjected to isolation and sensory deprivation regimens,
and
labeled ‚Äúpredators, the worst of the worst,‚Äù and even ‚Äúanimals‚Äù by Dr.
Urban,
the head of the psychology department of USP Marion. Amnesty
International went
as far as defining the barbaric conditions in that gulag as a ‚Äúlegal
crime.‚Äù Sensory
deprivation and isolation regimens cause a plethora of mental
illness/problems,
including PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) ‚Äî the same mental
disorder war
veterans suffer.
¬†
And there were political prisoners with me in
the gulag
known as ADX Florence. There some of us were subjected to a sleep
deprivation
regimen that was pure and simple torture. I experienced it for 58 days
and my
sleeping patterns were so badly damaged that I still have serious
problems
sleeping. In these two gulags political prisoners were also the targets
of
constant harassment such as cell searches, confiscation of reading and
art
materials and placement in hot cells where there was contraband in
order to
issue us infractions, send us to the hole, and force us to start the
‚Äústep-down‚Äù
program all over again.
¬†
Since I have been in the gulags all of my
communication
has been intercepted and monitored, including my legal mail. My family
has been
persecuted and criminalized. Three days after I was sentenced my
brother Jos√©
was fired from his job at Northeastern Illinois University, and before
that
sent to prison for 11 months for refusing to testify before a grand
jury. My
mother, at age 70, was made my co-conspirator. Anyone who knew my
mother knows
she would rather have died than to engage in any criminal activity. The
FBI has
even tried to destroy good community programs that at one point and
time I was
associated with. The last 14 years I have spent in this gulag, Terre
Haute. And
the harassment has not stopped. Several times my art materials have
been
confiscated or lost, art work destroyed, family visits stopped, and I
still
have to report to the jailers every two hours. In those 14 years, in
spite of
all the provocations and harassment, the jailers haven‚Äôt been able to
accuse me
of committing any infractions. But that doesn‚Äôt stop them from doing
what
they‚Äôve been doing to me for the past 31 years. And I‚Äôm fairly certain
the
other political prisoners continue experiencing the same treatment and
conditions.
¬†
It could be argued that government‚Äôs denial of
our
existence has worked. But our wills and spirits are strong enough to
continue
resisting and struggling.
¬†
En resistencia y lucha [in resistance and
struggle],
Oscar L√≥pez Rivera






Declaraci√≥n ¬†ante ¬†la sentencia de Norberto Gonz√°lez Claudio
14 de noviembre de 2012
Elda Santiago



En el d√≠a de hoy ¬†se cumpli√≥ el acuerdo pol√≠tico ¬†escrito en el que el 
gobierno de Estados Unidos reconoce ¬†que la participaci√≥n ¬†como 
dirigente que tuviera Norberto Gonz√°lez ¬†Claudio en ¬†la expropiaci√≥n ¬†a 
la Wells Fargo, ¬†que realizara ¬† la organizaci√≥n ¬† puertorrique√±a Los 
Macheteros en el a√±o 1983, fue para promover la Independencia de PR y 
¬†no fue ¬†para beneficio personal.

Norberto Gonz√°lez Claudio ¬†ha sido ¬† defensor de los derechos civiles, ¬†humanos y ¬†por la justicia social ¬†de los puertorrique√±os desde su adolescencia. 
¬†Ha sido incansable defensor de los derechos de los estudiantes y los 
¬†trabajadores puertorrique√±os ¬†y del mundo en general. Ha luchado contra el sistema colonial que tenemos en Puerto Rico ¬† y por su 
¬†independencia de Estados Unidos, la naci√≥n que lo coloniza. ¬† Hoy a sus 67 a√±os ha sido sentenciado a encarcelamiento y probatoria posterior a 
este ¬†por esta naci√≥n ¬†que ¬†luch√≥ y tuvo sus luchadores por la 
independencia¬†como ¬†√©l. ¬†


Desde el 10 de mayo de 2011, cuando fue arrestado por el FBI en ¬†Puerto Rico y transportado a los Estados Unidos,¬†ha estado ¬†prisionero en Rhode 
Island sin derecho a fianza. En esta prisi√≥n privada ¬†Donald Wyatt ( 
¬†DWWDF ) lo mantienen en solitaria con un m√≠nimo de horas para 
ejercitarse y comunicarse con sus familiares. ¬†Para el mes de¬†enero de 2012 ¬†le diagnosticaron c√°ncer de piel ¬†y no fu√© hasta mayo que le ¬†sometieron a cirug√≠a para remoci√≥n de la lesi√≥n cancerosa. Nunca tuvo una visita de 
seguimiento posterior a la cirug√≠a y, al d√≠a de hoy, su condici√≥n de 
c√°ncer no ha sido reevaluada por un m√©dico, por lo que se desconoce su 
condici√≥n en este momento.

Norberto est√° ¬†feliz ¬†de poder impulsar la libertad de¬†su patria, ¬†de luchar 
¬†contra la explotaci√≥n del hombre por el hombre y por la unidad 
patri√≥tica. Para √©l esa es su misi√≥n en esta vida. ¬†Es ¬†defensor del 
pueblo puertorrique√±o y de todos los pueblos y naciones oprimidas. Por 
eso acepta su sentencia con una sonrisa.

Agradecemos ¬† a todas las ¬†personas que desean apoyar a Norberto en su decisi√≥n de 
aceptar encarcelamiento y probatoria ¬†por defender a su naci√≥n del 
colonialismo estadounidense, del ¬†derecho de los puertorrique√±os a su 
libertad y su soberan√≠a. Entendemos que cada persona individual o en 
asociaci√≥n con otros escoge su mejor forma de dar su apoyo y solidaridad ¬† y nosotros as√≠ ¬†lo aceptamos. ¬†Reconocemos a la Coordinadora de 
Solidaridad con la Diaspora Boricua (COSODIBO ) que hoy nos acompa√±a 
aqu√≠ en Hartford; a las organizaciones Pro Libertad, Freedom Campaign, 
The Ricanstruction Action Party, El Partido Independentista 
Puertorrique√±o-Nueva York, El Movimiento Socialista de 
Trabajadores-NYC, IFCO/Pastors for Peace, ¬†y La Fundacion Andres 
Figueroa Cordero, tambi√©n a el Partido Workers World-Mundo  Obrero

que est√°n ofreciendo ¬†su apoyo desde Nueva York, ¬† y en PR ¬†a el Comit√© de Apoyo a Avelino y Norberto Gonz√°lez Claudio (CAANGC), 
¬†el Partido Independentista Puertorrique√±o (PIP), ¬†Comit√© de Derechos 
Humanos de Puerto Rico (CDH), la Coordinadora Caribe√±a y 
Latinoamericana de Puerto Rico (CCLPR), el¬† Ej√©rcito Popular Boricua-Macheteros, el Partido Nacionalista de 
Puerto Rico Movimiento Libertador (PN-ML),¬† el¬† Movimiento Independentista¬† Nacional 
Hostosiano (MINH),¬† el 
Frente Socialista (FS), el¬† Movimiento al Socialismo (M√ÅS), el Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores-Macheteros, el Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores Puertorrique√±os-Macheteros,¬† La Nueva Escuela, ¬†el Partido Comunista (PC) entre¬†otras 
¬†organizaciones que han dicho presente para acompa√±ar a Norberto en el 
d√≠a de hoy . ¬† Norberto, su familia y yo le damos nuestra m√°s expresivas gracias por ¬†todo este apoyo.

ORLANDO, Fla.-Supporters of Oscar
Lopez Rivera have kicked off a petition drive asking President
Barack Obama to grant clemency to the Puerto Rican independentista, who
has served more than 31 years in federal custody, making him the
longest-held political prisoner in the island's history. Lopez will
turn 70 on Jan. 6.


Supporters of Lopez, including his niece, spoke at an event
organized by the Orlando chapter of the National Boricua Human Rights
Network¬† on Nov. 19 and held at the Asociacion Borinque√±a in east
Orlando. The NBHRN works for the decontamination of former U.S. Navy
facilities on the island of Vieques, the release of all Puerto Rican
political prisoners, and an end to political repression and
criminalization of progressive forces in the Puerto Rican community. 



"This is a humanitarian effort on behalf of those in the
international community who would like to see Oscar free once and for
all," said¬†Zoraida Rios-Andio,¬†vice chair of the Central Florida
chapter of the National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights


"It's embarrassing for our country [for the president] to go speak
about political prisoners [in other countries] and yet keep in prison
someone who has contributed immensely to the Puerto Rican community,
not only in Chicago but across the U.S., and who inspires all of us,"
said New York State Assemblyman Jose Rivera, a Democrat who represents
parts of the Bronx.


So far, Lopez's supporters have collected almost 100,000 signatures.
The deadline to sign
the petition¬†and send it to the NBHRN is Dec. 15.


*Lopez's supporters hope a delegation can meet with the Obama
administration sometime in January to make the case for early release
for someone whom many Puerto Ricans consider an inspirational figure
for his struggle and sacrifice on behalf of independence for their
homeland.


The petition¬†to President Obama points out that "three U.S.
presidents have exercised the constitutional power of pardon to commute
the sentences of men and women in U.S. prisons for Puerto Rican
independence: President Truman in 1952, President Carter in 1979, and
President Clinton in 1999. We are mindful that all of Mr. Lopez'
co-defendants have been released, and most of them live in Puerto Rico,
where they are well respected, productive members of our civil society.
...


"We are always hopeful when we hear expressions by your
administration that political prisoners in other countries should be
released, as we eagerly await application of this policy to Oscar Lopez
Rivera's case right here at home."


At his first federal parole hearing in 2011, Lopez was denied the
right to call witnesses and to have legal observers and family members
present, while the government called 11 witnesses who sought to
implicate Lopez in acts in which he was not involved. His next parole
hearing will not be until 2026, when he will be 83.


"On behalf of our family we really want to thank everybody that has
shown solidarity in the release of our uncle, Oscar Lopez," said his
niece, Lourdes Lugo Lopez.
"It's been 31 years of not having him for celebrations as well as to
mourn," said Lugo, noting that many of Lopez's relatives, including his
mother and sister, have died during his lengthy incarceration.


Lugo urged Lopez's supporters to contact the White House asking for
clemency for Lopez. "Call the president and say, 'I heard about Oscar.
Why is he in prison?'" she said.
Lopez's release enjoys wide support in Puerto Rico, not only from
pro-independence forces, but from the Senate and House, the Bar
Association, former governors, unions, religious denominations, and
community activists, among other sectors. Lopez also has growing
support among sectors of the Latino and Puerto Rican communities in the
U.S.


Lopez, born in San Sebastian, P.R., moved to Chicago when he was a
teenager. In the 1960s he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in
Vietnam, where he earned a Bronze Star. After he returned home, he
became a community activist, working on issues of poverty,
discrimination, education, and police brutality in Chicago's Puerto
Rican neighborhoods.
According to the NBHRN, Lopez "was arrested in 1981, accused of
being a member of a clandestine force seeking independence for Puerto
Rico, and sentenced to 55 years for seditious conspiracy. He was not
accused or convicted of causing harm or taking a life.


"In 1988, as the result of a government-made conspiracy to escape,
he was given an additional 15 years."


"From 1986 to 1998, he was held in the most super maximum security
prisons in the federal prison system," says the NBHRN, "in conditions
not unlike those at Guantanamo under which 'enemy combatants,' are
held, conditions which the International Red Cross, among other human
rights organizations, have called tantamount to torture."


In prison Lopez has run educational programs for other inmates out
of his cell and has become an accomplished artist. An exhibit of his
drawings and paintings, Not
Enough Space, was shown throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico and Mexico.


Other speakers at the event included the Rev.¬†Roberto Morales, of
St. John's Episcopal Church in Kissimmee, Fla.; Denise Diaz of Central
Florida Jobs with Justice and the Central Florida¬†Labor Council for
Latin American Advancement (national and Central Florida LCLAA have
both passed resolutions calling for Lopez's release); and Rico Picard,
of community group Frente Unido 436.

Puerto Rico independence leader returns home
By By Danica Coto on December 07, 2012 
http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-12-07/puerto-rico-independence-leader-returns-home


SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) ‚Äî The former leader of a militant group
that has long fought for Puerto Rico's independence from the U.S. was
greeted by dozens of supporters Thursday as he arrived home to finish
serving a prison sentence.


Avelino Gonzalez Claudio eluded the FBI for more than two decades
before he was arrested in Puerto Rico in 2008 for involvement in a $7
million robbery of a Wells Fargo & Co. armored truck depot in
Connecticut in 1983. At the time, It was the biggest cash robbery in
U.S. history.


Gonzalez was sentenced in 2010 to seven years in prison, and spent
most of the past two years at a federal prison in Ashland, Kentucky.
Prison spokesman Brian Sparks said in a phone interview that Gonzalez
was cleared for placement in a residential re-entry center in Puerto
Rico to help integrate him back into society.


Gonzalez will be freed Feb. 5, Sparks said.


As Gonzalez emerged from the main international airport in San Juan,
supporters applauded and shouted, "Homeland or Death!" and "Free Puerto
Rico!" while furiously waving the island's red, white and blue flag.


Despite the raucous welcome, the independence movement has dwindled
in recent years, with mostly college students and aging activists
embracing a cause that once dominated the Caribbean island's political
scene.¬†


Gonzalez, who is nearly 70, hugged a few supporters but did not
speak to anyone as ordered by authorities. Family members took him to
the re-entry center in the San Juan area.
Hilton Fernandez Diamante, a close friend and fellow independence
activist, said in a phone interview that Gonzalez has Parkinson's and
will receive medical treatment in hopes of improving his condition.


"He's very deteriorated physically, but his mind is very sharp,
always thinking about his ideals and the fact that Puerto Rico will
someday obtain its political freedom," said Fernandez, who also served
five years in the Wells Fargo case.


He acknowledged that what used to be Puerto Rico's main independence
party has splintered into embittered factions, with independence
candidates struggling to get onto the ballot.
"Struggles have their time and their place," Fernandez said.
"Neither the intention, nor the intensity, nor the desire of those who
fight for freedom has really changed. Circumstances are what change."


In a Puerto Rico referendum last month, a majority of voters said
they were not content with the island's status as a U.S. territory. But
only a small percentage of votes cast on a second question backed
independence, while a majority supported seeking U.S. statehood. In a
complication for determining sentiment on what Puerto Ricans want for
the island, nearly a half million voters left the second question
blank.


Fernandez said the independence group that he and Gonzalez belong
to, Los Macheteros, will keep fighting for independence, saying they
don't fear statehood. "We don't believe the United States will accept
Puerto Rico," he said.


U.S. authorities consider Los Macheteros a terrorist group. It has
claimed responsibility for murders, bombings and robberies during the
1970s and '80s, including killing two U.S. sailors in an attack on a
Navy bus in Puerto Rico in 1979.


Two of Gonzalez's brothers also were arrested in the Wells Fargo
heist. Only one fugitive remains: Victor Gerena, who is one of the
FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives and is believed to be living in Cuba.

Press Release - Community Alert from The Welfare Poets (Members arrested last night with film crew, Iz the Truth of GREP)




by¬†Welfare Poets¬†on Sunday, December 16, 2012 at 12:57pm ¬∑
Press Release - Community Alert from The Welfare Poets
Sunday, December 16th 2012
12:45pm
¬†
Last night, Saturday December 15th 2012, at around 5pm in East Harlem (El Barrio), two members of the socio-political Hip Hop fusion band, The Welfare Poets (Michael Pacheco - The Legendary M.I.C. and Keith Hughes - Dahu Alah), along with their film crew Ricky Turner and Wander Acosta (who are also members of the Hip Hop group Lower Class Citizens) were arrested while filming a music video at the NYCHA's James Weldon Johnson Houses by NYPD for criminal trespassing, a misdemeanor.¬† Additionally Iz The Truth (Israel Balleto) of Guerrilla Republik (a progressive Hip Hop clothing company and organization in which the Welfare Poets are directly a part of) and Boom Box were also arrested.¬† The Welfare Poets were filming footage for an upcoming music video.
¬†
In a case like this, anyone arrested is booked at a precint (in this case, the NYPD Service Area #5) and sent downtown to Manhattan Central Booking to be processed -- for a misdemeanor a normal person would be out in less than 24 hours.¬† Although this might be the case for the two Welfare Poets and the others who were with them, what makes what happened here different is when they were all initially stopped by the cops, the police officers said they would probably be given a summons and released without going to the precinct.¬†¬† Once the cops found out that the collective were part of The Welfare Poets, the officers started claiming that the group was connected to Los Macheteros and how they knew about them (The Welfare Poets) -- how they have has their eyes on the collective for some time.¬† The officers called their sergeant and it was decided to arrest the six and take them to the precinct to be booked and eventually sent downtown for further
 processing thru central booking where they would face an arraignment judge.¬† At least seven cops came to arrest group.
¬†
Los Macheteros (Machete-Wielders) are a clandestine militant organization based on the island of Puerto Rico. They campaign for, and support, the decolonization and independence of Puerto Rico from the United States. In 1983, Los Macheteros were accused of stealing approximately $7 million from a Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford, Connecticut. The money obtained from this operation was allegedly used to help fund the Puerto Rican independence movement. On September 23rd 2005, the FBI assassinated its leader, Filiberto Ojeda Rios claiming it was an attempt to serve an arrest warrant on him, who the surrounded his house in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico.
¬†
We are urging anyone and everyone to first spread the word virtually through all your available means, and then to call down to 100 Center Street, the Manhattan Criminal Court Building and inquire about these brothers.¬† The Welfare Poets are long time community activist and educators in addition to being artists committed to addressing and improving the conditions of oppressed people everywhere.¬† Their unwavering commitment has made them targets over the years to units like the Hip Hop Police and the NYPD in general.¬† Whether at a rally, on death row, in a school or the community in general, The Welfare Poets have been there for all without compromise.¬† In the end, if you can head down to the courthouse in lower Manhattan at 100 Center Street today (now!!!), please do so.¬† If you are a lawyer and know of the work that these brothers (and sisters) do, have done and will continue to do, use whatever means you have to reach out on the behalf of all
 these individuals. We will not let our community artists be harassed by this repressive police force or any/all repressive forces in this country.
¬†
For assistance you can call:
¬†(917) 995-6558
¬†
To call the courthouse and inquire on the behalf of all these brother:
(646) 386-4511
¬†
To head down there in person right now!!!!
100 Centre Street, New York, NY 10013
Take the No. 4 or 5 train to the Brooklyn Bridge Station; the C, N, R, 6 train to Canal Street; the 1 train to Franklin Street.
Take the 1, 6 or 15 bus line.

The production brings us into the U.S. prison system in a way no other play
has, focusing on the politically motivated use of isolation, selective
punishment, sensory deprivation and disproportionate sentences.

NEW YEAR'S GREETINGS FROM THE CUBAN 5!

Fernando Gonz·lez  
Dear friends:
Another year of intense effort of solidarity with the struggle for our freedom 
is coming to a close. Countless have been the actions, demonstrations 
and palpable results of the work by all of you in different parts of the world.
The vigor of 
your solidarity is evident. If a few years ago our situation was almost 
unknown, today, thanks to you all, to your tireless work and 
initiatives, the information about the case of the Cuban Five has 
reached almost all corners of the universe, in politics and society.

There is still much to do, although not for lack of your efforts, but rather, because 
of the stubborn opposition and obstacles by powerful forces who conspire to maintain our reality in absolute silence.

Nevertheless, 
we have confidence in your humane quality, in your wisdom and commitment as activists, and in your inexhaustible spirit of solidarity. We know 
we can count on you and that you will accompany us until together we 
reach our goal: Freedom and the return to our homeland and our families.

May our most 
profound gratitude reach each one of you in the city or town of the 
universe, from where you extend your solidarity.
Many thanks for your support, much success in 2013, and best wishes for the new year.

Venceremos!
Fernando Gonz·lez Llort

Dear friends:

2012 is coming to an end. As I meditated on how to express to you our 
eternal appreciation for all your support;  and our deep admiration for 
your dedication to the most noble and just causes in the world, these 
verses came to my heart which I dedicate to you all on behalf of the 
Cuban Five.
PARA LA LIBERTAD
"Para la libertad
sangro, lucho, pervivo"
Miguel Hernandez
Para la libertad
pervivo, sangro y lucho.
Para la libertad
el corazon desnudo.
Para la libertad
con poco tengo mucho.
Para la libertad
todo lo mio es tuyo.
Para la libertad
fijo el sol en un punto
y en mis pupilas vierto
toda la luz del mundo.
Para la libertad
los pechos como muros,
las manos como alas,
las bocas como punos.
Para la libertad
la esencia del crepusculo,
la cohesion del sueno,
la historia del futuro.
Para la libertad,
del presagio confuso
un verso, que despierta
con un grito nocturno.
Para la libertad,
en un tunel oscuro
saber reconocer
y defender lo justo.
Con jubilo, dignidad y libertad, decimos junto a todo nuestro pueblo y los
amigos del mundo:
!Viva la Revolucion en su 54 aniversario!
!Feliz 2013!
!Venceremos!
Cinco abrazos fuertes.
