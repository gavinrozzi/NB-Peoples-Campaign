Message:

The media committee of the people' convention has begun this e-mail list to aid 
our communications.  We should be able to update one another more easily.  Also 
interested people outside of New Brunswick can watch our progress and hopefully become inspired to undertake similar activity in their cities around the country. 
Please get as many people as possible to join the list.

Power to the People!

Message:

Great to see a listserv going on for the campaign! One thing: I wanted to 
forward the message to some people who know the campaign is going on (but 
know very little about the breadth and depth of it), and I thought twice 
because we don't have a general campaign message for email and online uses. 
Please respond.  In Unity, Paul

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] LPCCD Kiosk Model
Message:

This weekend I plan to carve out a scaled model
for the kiosk or the Newark-NJ Store, if you are
interested in working it out, please come over
to 95 0rchard Street. Although I've finalized the 
details, good suggestions are always welcome.

Construction of this prototype is very simple,
requiring no nails or elaborate tools. As a prototype
it could be expanded according to a given site
(City Hall, Gateway Concourse, Newark Airport,
Penn Station etc.) At this stage the Kiosk, to be
unveiled at the Gala, seems to defines the arts 
follow commerce concept, in any case 
the process remains participatory and the final
physical form of the Official Newark NJ Store
would evolve out of it.

Built entirely out of clear acrylic (Plexiglas or Lexon)
the structure is transparent, (symbolic of a see through
organizational philosophy for a community corporation)
It's also light and portable. Making it simple and inexpensive
also means we have flexibility for the Newark Youth
known to pay their regards in style. Arrangement of the
Kiosk panels would allow securing some of the merchandise
overnight while allowing passer-byes to pick up flyers and pamphlets as
even when the kiosk is left without an
attendant, as I imagine the case would be, most of the time.

I could attach an ACAD R14 Drawing file if you'd like to review
construction details but you may find the file difficult to read.
Let me know, call me at 973 848 0688, but may be on Saturday
my answering machine will not be hooked up (courtesy Bell
Atlantic)
I've been making and breaking some paper models and over
the weekend (5-6th) I plan to make a sturdier model that
could be discussed at the outreach meeting. I haven't heard
yet from the firm that suppose to build the Kiosk but in the
meantime I've located a store on Canal Street to buy the 
acrylic panels. over the long weekend I have to go to
Washington DC (for my housing stuff) so I guess the actual
hammering has to be scheduled next weekend (Feb 12-13)
and I imagine we will have to accomplish this with our own
resources.

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Save the National Endowment for the Arts
Message:

In NPR Morning Edition, Nina Totenberg said that if the
Supreme Court
supports Congress, it is in effect the end of NEA (National
Endowment for
the Arts). This situation creates great concerns about
Congressional funding for creative arts in America, since NEA
provides major
support for NPR (National Public Radio) & PBS (Public
Broadcasting System),
and numerous other creative and performing arts. If NEA is
lost or weakened,
our lives are similarly diminished.
   In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending
costs and
streamline their services, some government officials believe
that the
funding currently going to these programs is too large a
portion of funding
for something which is seen as not worthwhile. Currently,
taxes from the
general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person per year, and
the National
Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year. A January
1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of Americans
wish
to keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense and
law
enforcement as the most valuable programs for federal funding.
    Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations committees
each
have 13 subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and
agencies.
Each subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill. The goal
each year is
to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year.
The only way
that our representatives can be aware of the base of support
for PBS and
funding for these types of programs is by making our voices
heard.
    Please add your name to this list and forward it to
friends
who believe in favor of what this stands for. This list will
be forwarded to
the President of the United States, the Vice President of the
United States,
and the Speaker Of The House, the office of which has in the
past been the
instigator of the action to cut funding to these worthwhile
programs.
    This petition is being passed around the Internet. Please
add
your name to it so that funding can be maintained for the NEA,
NPR &
PBS. Please keep this petition rolling. Do not reply to me.
Please sign and
forward to others to sign. If you prefer not to sign, please
send to the
e-mail address indicated.  This is being forwarded to several
people at once
to add their names to the petition. It won't matter if many
people receive
the same list as the names are being managed. This is for
anyone who thinks
NPR/PBS is a worthwhile expenditure of $1.12/year of their
taxes.
    A petition follows. If you sign, please forward on to
others.
If not, please don't kill it.

   ****If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, etc.
signer
of this petition, please forward a copy to:

wein2688@...
mailto:wein2688@...

    This way we can keep track of the lists and organize
them.
Forward this to everyone you know, and help us to keep these
programs
alive.


   Thank you.


   NOTE: It is preferable that you SELECT the entirety of
this
letter and then COPY it into a new outgoing message, rather
than simply
forwarding it. In your new outgoing message, add your name to
the bottom of
the list, then send it on. Or if option is available, do a
SEND AGAIN.

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] BARAKA/BLUEARK at NJIT: A Victory for the People!
Message:

I am fowarding this message to those who have helped to bring Amiri Basaka 
to NJIT Feb 10th-in order that you may understand a little better the forces 
at work behind the scenes when we act together to create positive change.  
Amiri Baraka was fired from Rutgers for expressing the thought provoking 
ideas that he so eloquently conveyed to us last night.  This was an 
exceptionally successful event, and as one Arch. Const. Professor put it, "A 
coup for NJIT."  To all those who participated in this event, a heartfelt 
thankyou.  We saw what we can accomplish when we work together.  And thanks 
to a couple of minor "miracles", we were actually able to feed not only the 
hearts and minds of 150 people, but also the stomachs.  Not to mention the 
last minute sound system, music stands, Funk-y Poetry tribute to Baraka, the 
Schuman/Moore Studio exhibit expressing our potential contributions to 
Newark, which Baraka was really thrilled to see; etc, etc.  Keep it on the 
upbeat, and let's see where we can take this.  But keep in mind, as the 
following message portrays, we should consider ourselves fortunate at NJIT 
for the level of support that we have been receiving so far.  -Matthew Smith

Message:


FYI --

There's a vigil planned for tomorrow (Sunday, Feb. 13) New York City,
Union Square at 11:00am. Anything organized for New Brunswick or Newark
in the coming week?

See http://www.november.org/twomilliontoomany.html for more info.

-------------
Two Million is Too Many," Say Drug Policy and Penal Reformers

WASHINGTON, DC:  Protests and vigils in over 30 cities will 
greet the day crime experts predict our nation will 
incarcerate more than two million people.  The Justice 
Policy Institute reported last December that America's 
prison and jail population would top two million on February 
15th, 2000.  The JPI study "The Punishing Decade: Prison and 
Jail Estimates at the Millennium" reports:

 * The US has the world's highest incarceration rate, 
surpassing Russia and China, and the world's largest prison 
population.  With less than five percent of the world's 
population, the US now has fully one-quarter of the world's 
prisoners.

 * There are six times as many Americans behind bars as are 
imprisoned in the 12 countries making up the entire European 
Union, even though those countries have 100 million more 
citizens than the US.

 * Nearly one in three African American boys born this year 
will spend some time in prison.

>From New York City, into Texas, through California and the 
Pacific Northwest, vigils of protest will be held near 
jails, courthouses and prisons as part of nationwide events 
drawing attention to the social and financial costs of 
imprisoning two million Americans, the largest prison 
population in the world.

"Two million is too many," says Nora Callahan, Director of 
the November Coalition, a national reform group calling for 
alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent drug offenders.  
"In thirty cities we will call on state and federal 
governments to stop breaking up families and destroying our 
communities.  Prison is not the solution to every social 
problem," says Callahan.

Detailed contact and location information can be found 
online at <http://www.november.org/twomilliontoomany.html>,

Hi, guys,  

Ive been trying to think about what good democratic processes would
be for the People's Campaign.  Seems to me we need to talk about this and
get alot of input from people on this process so that things run well and
everyone who wants to be is included.

Leadership:

1.  Is the steering committee provisional?  If so, we need to have another
election of the steering committee before the Peoples Convention, and
once we have enough representation. Doing that on that weekend as well as
the Convention - platform and candidates seems too much.

2.  When the steering committee gets reelected, all representatives should
live in New Brunswick.

Process:

1.  All committee meetings should have minutes copied or typed before the
next steering committee meeting so steering committee reps are up to date 
on what is going on. (at this moment I am in violation of this)

2.  At each general meeting (such as Feb 26) each committee should give a
report that includes:
	1) repeating what the prior general meeting had charged the
committee to do;
	2) summarizing key actions taken over the month
	3) presenting key actions that the committee plans to take over
the next month and gaining voting approval.

Meeting:

0.  Sign in/welcome.  Food. Child care. People flag on a map where
they live. Pass out agenda sheet and contact sheet for steering committee.
1.  Intros should be first.  Everyone should have the chance to introduce
themselves with their name, why they came, and what they are most
concerned about in New Brunswick. If they are a steering
committee member, they should introduce themselves as such.
2. Ask for revisions to agenda. Someone should introduce the campaign and
emphasize the importance of unity.
3.  Present the general strategy of the campaign, key steps to accomplish
before the convention.
4.  Vote on any major steps in the strategy.
5.  Committee reports.  Vote on key plans with each report.
6.  Outline block group organization. Set up area organizing reps. Decide
whether surveying will back up local block group organizers or will be
done separately from local organizing.
7.  Encourage people to sign up for each committee.  Provide them with
contact information for the newly elected committee leader.
8.  We have egroups for communication.  Ask if we should set up a phone
system for those not on internet, where a few people with internet call a
list of a few people to inform them of what was emailed if it is not a
committee message.

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Re: Organization
Message:

Matthew Smith, here- I'd like to chime in on this proposal.  For those who 
don't know me, I've worked with NJFO for the past 4-5 years (!) and though I 
moved to Newark last summer to attend NJIT, I still consider myself an 
active NJFO member, representing the organization in my activities up in the 
"Bricks".
*********************************************************************
About this proposal:  I think there are alot of constructive & practical 
suggestions in it.  I don't want to get into each point, but the one that 
jumped out was the claus to restrict steering committee members to New 
Brunswick residents.  To be frank, I know that there are organizers who I 
have worked with in New Brunswick on New Brunswick issues for years, while 
they have not lived in New Brunwsick.  This is natural in a college town 
where many of us came into town for school, but lived in, say Highland Park 
or North Brunswick because the rent is cheaper (H.P. has rent control while 
N.B. does not)  In fact, very very few N.B. highschool graduates ever get to 
go to college (15% I believe) let alone Rutgers.  So, in a campaign such as 
this that is significantly tied to & based on the energies of student 
organizers or former student organizers from out of town, it doesn't seem 
practical to restrict the Steering Committee based on place of residence.  
Back when the Coalition Against Police Brutality (of which NJFO has been the 
most consistant participant through the years) was very active around the 
murder of Sissy Adams by former Officer James Consalvo, the town used to 
spend alot of time labeling us as "Outsiders" as if the nature of the Police 
murdering people somehow changes when the ones who raise the issue didn't 
grow up in the same town.  Actually, the fact was that most of the Coalition 
was made up residents who did grow up in NB, which is what made it so 
effective a force.  But the RESIDENTS who we worked with didn't care if we 
came from the moon once we demonstrated that we were on there side, fighting 
with them and lending support in whatever ways that we could.
In Conclusion, elections to the Steering Committee should be based on 
LEADERSHIP: IDEOLOGY and PRACTICE.  Not where people live.

Message:

************************ATTENTION E'R BODY***************************

Last minute push to bring folks out to the Lincoln Park Coast Cultural 
District DANCE & GALA at Symphony Hall's Terrace Ballroom...This Friday at 8 
PM.

Let's show the city of Newark that we're for real by our numbers.  There 
have been alot of sceptics and naysayers, but things are coming together in 
a brilliant fashion!  Kiosk construction has gone into overdrive...In 
itself, it will be a coup for the People of Newark for this to be placed in 
City Hall with all of Newark Memorabilia (The collective memory of the 
people, their culture, their struggles...) This is a significant 
crystalization of the struggle in the superstructure (the struggle over 
ideas in culture,politics,etc) In my estimation, a coming into being of 
cultural revolutionary thought...I feel that this event will cause people to 
act or react!

*************************Also to be unveiled************************

***The computer animated multimedia map of the LPCCD & History.  (Look out 
for a feature article in Thursday's Star Ledger "Today" Section)

***The LPCCD Postcard Series!!!

***The LPCCD Booklet hot off the press!!!

***More, Much more!!!

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Lech Walesa coming to Rutgers on Sunday...?!
Message:

I just received notice that my arch-nemesis, Lech Walesa, is coming to 
Rutgers on Sunday.  I am curious as to his itinerary and whether anyone 
would be interested in perhaps showing that we do not appreciate him 
pontificating on the alleged virtues of the so-called democracy he
claims to 
have built -- a 54% poverty rate, unprecedented levels of crime,
corruption, 
bureaucratic abuse, the flourishing of the comprador bourgeoise at the 
expense of the population at large, the neocolonialization of Poland --
in 
short, the decimation of a nation for the benefit of a select few.  

If anyone does not know who Lech Walesa is, he was the leader of
Solidarity 
in the 1980s and the first 'democratic' president of Poland.  He had an 
'autobiography' ghostwritten, entitled "A Way of Freedom".  How do I
know it 
was ghostwritten?  Walesa is a notorious nitwit, indeed, the Dan Quayle
of 
Polish politics, and this book is clearly written by someone with far
more 
literary skill than he is capable of. 

Sorry for spewing -- the subject of Poland is quite possibly the most 
passionate sociopolitical stimulus in my heart, where the ravages of 
capitalism have very clearly impacted the culture and society in which
I was 
born and raised, and have done so beyond all recognition.

Hi, 

great job.

I like the hands - I think its something that relates to every issue we will tackle - we will need to stay together and be strong.  I also think alot of people can relate to it.  Can we tint or shade one or both hands to be representative since they both look white - still trying to keep the lines that you have that are prominent?  Also can we put a second slogan below them?

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Web Site update, request for content from individual committees, please read.
Message:

Okay, things are rolling along... the outline of the future web site is
starting to take form.  You can see it at http://gw.darkcartel.com, or
http://151.198.10.71 if the first link does not work.  Pardon my lack of
aesthetic ability -- form invariably follows function in my work.  Our grand
and illustrious User Interface Designer, Jessie Want, will undoubtedly
ensure that blandness of this sort will not plague the finished site.  ;)

The "Committees" section of the page will reflect the work of the respective
entities and, hopefully, promote recruitment into their ranks for those
interested in specific aspects of the movement.  Please forward any
materials that you would like posted on that section of the site, as well as
any text to be placed under other categories.  We are gathering articles and
announcements of news and events to be posted on the site.  We are also
planning to construct a central repository of documents that can be
downloaded from the site, printed, and subsequently copied by anyone with
access to a computer.  This further underscores the importance of relaying
campaign materials, preferrably in digital form, to the Media Committee, so
that by posting them online, we can vastly improve our channels of
distribution and account for the busy schedules of various members.

It is also now possible to subscribe to the mailing list from the web site.

The tentative name of the site, which works for me but apparently some are
having trouble with it, is :

peoplescampaign.us.eu.org

Since we have our own server, it is possible to register an actual domain
name with relative ease.  We could register "peoplescampaign.org", or
"nbpc.org", or "newbrunswickpeoplescampaign.org", or any variant thereof.
As the us.eu.org extension is a bit convoluted, we might want to take this
into consideration.

Other ideas :

Put the survey online, in such a manner in which the results could be
gathered along with the e-mail addresses of those surveyed, along with other
potential voting subjects.
Put a guestbook online.
Rotating quotes on the home page, i.e. from New Brunswick officials in
compromising situations which support our cause.
Links with e-mail addresses of various committee heads for contact purposes.
This needs to be considered carefully due to the possibility of attrition
against your mail accounts once we are seen as a serious threat.

I don't have my notebook with me, as I am happily taking my employer's money
while working on this task, so I don't remember what else we discussed.  We
need comments, comments, comments.

Message:

Today's Star Ledger carries a letter to the editor ("Exploiting a Tragedy") 
in which Irene Lebed of Stanhope, NJ writes:

"You [S.L.] quoted Newark activist Amiri Baraka as saying, 'What this 
verdict [acquital of Diallo murderers]says is that democracy does not exist

BARAKA MUST NOT LIVE HERE. (!-my emphasis) If it is so horrible here, why do 
Baraka, Calvin Butts, Al Sharpton, Reginald Jackson, Charles Barron and 
other bigots stay?  I'm sure decent folk would offer each a one-way ticket

We need to flood the Star Ledger with Letters to the Editor defending Amiri 
Baraka against this rascist and fascist slander.  Not to mention the attacks 
against every other Afro-American civil rights leader in the NY/NJ area.   
This letter proves the truth of Amiri's line that the US is not a democracy, 
because if you point it out, then they've got your "one-way" ticket 
waiting...which is in reality to PRISON...CONCENTRATION CAMPS...41 BULLETS! 
Remember that when they asked Paul Robeson why, if he likes the Soviet Union 
so much, why doesn't he stay there...and he responded, "Because my father 
was a slave."  We must defend our leaders & we must defend democracy!

Message:

Mmmrrrmmm, defend democracy, we will... here is my letter.


Irene Lebed's letter to the editor in the March 3rd edition of the Star
Ledger
offers an age-old 'solution' to an age-old 'problem'.  The 'problem' is that
of
dissenting views; the 'solution' is one that I, as an immigrant, have come
up
against time after time after voicing any type of critique of the allegedly
democratic establishment that controls our lives.  This is the emphatic
insistence 
that if I do not like it, I should move to another country.  The irony here
is that such a suggestion in response to a questioning of the democratic
nature
of our society only sheds further light on the narrow-minded conceptions of
those
who would utter such words.  To defend the system with such vehemence
illustrates
the success of our institutions in filling people's minds with intolerance
and
xenophobia. It further demonstrates that the superficially democratic
society
we live in does in fact breed conformity and attempts to stamp out pluralism
more
effectively than the Communist government of Poland under which I grew up.
This
society owes a great debt to the Black nation, which under coersion
contributed
so much of their blood, sweat, and tears to the United States of America.
And
we should remember that it has been only a few decades since the activists
of the valiant and noble civil rights movement were confronted with the same
cries --
"If you do not like it, why don't you just leave?"  Had they taken that
advice,
our darker-skinned brethren would still be attending segregated schools and
unable
to vote.  The very progress of humanity depends on an open-minded society,
one
willing to acknowledge and address its shortcomings without this type of
thoughtless and reactionary defense.

against every other Afro-American civil rights leader in the NY/NJ area.

This letter proves the truth of Amiri's line that the US is not a
democracy, 
because if you point it out, then they've got your "one-way" ticket 
waiting...which is in reality to PRISON...CONCENTRATION CAMPS...41
BULLETS! 
Remember that when they asked Paul Robeson why, if he likes the Soviet
Union 
so much, why doesn't he stay there...and he responded, "Because my
father 
was a slave."  We must defend our leaders & we must defend democracy!

Message:

There will be a planning board meeting 7:30 at City Hall Wed March 8th.

Undergoing 1st reading are key issues - the designation of 

government district redevelopment plan
Henry Oliver redevelopment plan
Downtown development district renewal area
amendments to the zoning ordinance
possible HOPE VI 

and old -

Brunswick  Raritan Housing Development Corp

In the planning field, designation of redevelopment area is the wildcard of planning.  It allows you to condemn and tear down buildings with impunity.  In some cases, this makes sense - but once the area is designated, there is little power to change the course of events as planned in the planning office.  Power to designate is based on proving one of number of conditions exist, such as "urban blight" or the low value of private property currently in the area.  We should be there to hear all that is planned in these many key redevelopment areas.

brutality. In may education etc.

Message:

Paul, I disagree.  I think that as it stands, there is not enough
communication between people on the campaign.  I concur that only
campaign-related materials should be posted to the list.  However, what is
"official"?  If I have a comment, I cannot post it?  I thought that was the
whole purpose of the list.  If not, then we need another forum aside from
the list where we can post our comments and suggestions that fail to qualify
for 'Official' status.

I, for one, have still not had any responses from the other committees
regarding their input into the People's Campaign site.   In the past week,
there have been maybe a dozen messages from the list.  If it inconveniences
you to receive a dozen messages, the vast majority of which are highly
relevant, how do you overcome the other inconveniences in your life caused
by being an activist?  Let's be reasonable.

Message:

So where is constructive discussion supposed to take place?  Regarding
campaign issues?  What if people have feedback or suggestions?  I think the
purpose of the list should be changed, then.  The monthly meetings surely do
not give a chance for people to put forth their commentary without which I
think the campaign would suffer.

I am not trying to be antagonistic, Paul.  I just think it is a bit absurd
to control content of the list to campaign issues only.  I thought it was
implicit that part of the purpose of the campaign is to build a community
infrastructure, not merely elect representatives.  I strongly believe that
the latter is impossible without the former.

Chris, The reason I posted this message is because the original stated 
purpose of the list is for announcements and minutes of meetings. I
think 
people can send input re website to you directly. Comments about issues 
outside the campaign can be run through njfo@egroups.com, or we can
create 
another group if people think it necessary. Cheers, Paul

okay, i have to put my two cents into this one (paul and chris' exchange on 
"official" email postings versus discussion postings).

I personally have no problem reading people's discussions on various 
relevent ( and i stress relevent) topics. i'm happy that some have the time 
to take part in these kinds of things, and we all may learn from the info. 
however, i'm starting to get annoyed with the amount of duplicate emails 
that get sent. i'm getting three or four copies of many of the messages that 
get posted, especially the announcements. that's what causes the massive 
overload of my email.

is there any way to make sure the duplication doesn't continue? should i 
take my name off of the "NB peoples campaign" elist because the same mail 
gets sent to the NJFO elist?

Please keep in mind that not everyone from the People's Campaign is
involved in NJFO, and I'm sure the opposite is true.  Because there is a
lot of overlap in the two groups those who subscribe to both lists will
inevitably get duplicates, but please keep in mind that not everyone is
subscribed to both.  

I would be missing out on a lot of events and discussion if it was taken
off of this list and kept strictly to NJFO.  I have no interest in joining
NJFO or its list, but I do appreciate the discussion produced by what has
been posted here on the People's Campaign list.

Does the NJFO list include information such as needing info from
committees for the website, and info about general people's campaign type
stuff in addition to the political discussion?

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Purpose of list
Message:

So far I have seen no discussion about the campaign.  Only announcements
about other things.

With that in mind, I'll take this chance to lend some constructive
criticism to last month's meeting.

1)  Planning the agenda for the meeting ahead of time (and by ahead of
time, I mean more than two days before the actual meeting), will give
the Steering Committee a chance to refine it, thus reassuring the smooth
flow of the meeting.  It will also give committees and individuals a
chance to have *input* on the agenda.

2)  I felt the meeting could have been moderated more strongly.  That
means first of all having votes in favor and against things; not saying
"does anybody oppose this?"  I believe Tom DeGloma pointed that out.
Furthermore, there should be no lengthy discussions about things that
result in no vote being taken.  We discussed the relationship of the
committees for nearly 40 mins, and at the end, when Kerry asked "How do
I notate this in the minutes," Keith basically told her not to bother.  

I think people intuitively have a better idea how how the campaign
committees function, but it would be nice, for the moral of the group,
to be able to come to a conclusion on these matters, perhaps put it to a
vote, and not let issues hang in the air.  I for one know that I was
rather confused both before and after the meeting.

This brings me to my third and final point:  The large majority of the
work should be done in the committees.  When we get together for a
monthly meeting, it should be to *reaffirm oyur goals and our group
moral.*  We had a three hour meeting, and not once were our goals talked
about.  I know we are a mixture of people from many different
backgrounds, and some of us have different expectations.  But I don't
think we should forget or fail to mention at any point that our main
task is to elect three people to City Council.  

Our goal is to *win*, and this should be emphasized every step of the
way.  I think this is very important for focus, moral, and unity.
People should leave these monthly meetings with a sense of belonging,
duty, ownership, and maybe even some zeal. :-)  These should be exciting
meetinsg where we get together and measure our progress in the *broader
picture*.  

I know we're just getting off the ground, and there are many kinks to
work out.  I think by implementing 1) and 2), we can help make the ride
smoother.  This will make our monthly meetings run more smoothly, and it
will also give newcomers a sense of our growing professionalism and
committment to our concrete task ahead.

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Community building.
Message:

I agree with everything Jim has said.  But allow me to pontificate a bit 
about a point I vaguely made earlier.   I concur that our immediate and
concrete goals are of vast importance, and priority should duly be assigned
to them.  

However, there is a potential here to go beyond the November elections --
to build a community infrastructure that is sorely lacking in this modern
age, to build ties between groups of activists and citizens that would allow
us not only to mobilize our forces succinctly when it is called for, but
also
to provide a social backbone to the popular movement.  We already have plans
to put together cultural and social events to draw people out and get them
involved in our campaign.  Should this end with the campaign?  Is it not our
duty, as progressives, to demonstrate the way that a society should be built
--
around culture, education, self-respect?  Can we ignore the need to show
that
alternatives to market culture and McDonaldization are plausible?  And how
can we expect people to come out and support us if activism and the struggle
for social justice is not emotionally fulfilling on an interpersonal
level?  

I am likely to get snubbed by some of our more hardline colleagues in
putting
forward this line.  This is petty bourgeois idealism with an anarchistic
scent,
yes, I know.  But it is also, from the perspective of social psychology and
my
own personality, the only way to build a social movement.  Yes, strong
leaders
are necessary, yes, it is necessary to have a clear and concise agenda.  But
we
must not neglect human nature in our zeal to accomplish concrete goals.  We
must
enjoy working together, not just to achieve our political goal, but with
genuine
camaraderie and empathy.  Throw in our agenda and we have a winning platform
and
the potential to establish an unprecedented connection to the community.

Go ahead, flame away :)

Chris

I couldn't agree more.  On top of this I would add that theory is fine,
but only if we can make our theory applicable to the every day lives of
people.  This goes for those of us who are Marxists, and it also applies
to those that are merely interested in short-term political goals.

We have to bring the issues to thew people in an accessible way, and we
have to show them how the situation at large affects their particular
lives.  This is done largely through personal connection, and for this
reason I think the canvassing is a valuable tool.

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] WE MUST GO TO THE PEOPLE!
Message:

A message from the Steering Committee:

Sisters & Brothers,

We need ALL OF YOU to come and take part in the week-end 
door-to-door canvass of the New Brunswick Community. 
Everyone is working hard and the campaign is growing by 
the minute. Several community figures (preachers, 
lawyers,...) have contacted us in the past week to get 
involved...BUT WE MUST CONTINUE TO REACH OUT TO THE 
PEOPLE! So far the Outreach Committee can only count on 
a half a dozen canvassers (less than 20% of some 40 
activists in the campaign). There are some 48,000 
eligible voters in the city, many of whom have never 
voted. We need EVERYONE to help if we are to get all of 
the people involved. Try it out and you'll be amazed at 
how empowering it is to talk to people about uniting to 
seize actual political power and transform the city. 
This is no run-of-the-mill please-give-a-dollar-to-my-
cause operation. Come and find out.
We call it the "People's Campaign" because we want the 
people to learn to organize themselves to seize 
political power. This is not possible if they don't know 
about the campaign in the first place. All of us who 
work on the Media, Fundraising, Right to Know and/or 
Steering Committee NEED TO REACH OUT TO THE PEOPLE in 
order to do our job for the campaign - how else do we 
know what to write on our flyers, how to present our 
research, what kind of events people want to take part 
in?
At the very least, everyone should come canvass one 
Saturday or Sunday each month. If your schedule makes it 
very difficult, come for ONE HOUR and talk to the people 
(especially the Afro-American and Latino workers who 
have been kept out of any political power by the Machine 
forever).

The Canvassers meet every Saturday at 1PM and every 
Sunday at 12 Noon at the New Brunswick Public Library.

In today's paper you may or may not have seen that Judge Hoffman
listened to officers Marshall and Chinchilla defense attorney's ask for
a dismissal.  You may remember these infamous officers for the fake
shooting that they staged in front of my home a few months ago, which
was followed by the wholesale arrests of young Afro-American men.  Or
you may know these cops for thier lucrative prositution ring or drug
dealing activities.  Judge Hoffman should have resigned from this case
since he is incapable of imaprialty telling reporters that "I like Jim
Marshal, he is a friend of mine".  I would like to know if Judge Hoffman
is a client of officer Marshall.  We should use this opportunity to
expose the need for elected judges, elected police review boards, and
the source of much of the crime in New Brunswick: the police department.

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Fundraising meeting
Message:

hello everyone,

i volunteered to put together a summary of Sunday night's fundraising 
meeting so all can keep aware of our end of things:

Attending: Kristina Bas, Frank Bright, Curtis Warren

1- adhering to formal NJ Elec (Election Law Enforcement Commission) 
paperwork (ie. creation of PAC, reporting of funds, etc) is now underway.

2- we have begun the first steps in creating campaign buttons/T-Shirts for 
sale, logos to be approved at next Steering committee meeting (which i 
believe they were)

* NOTE: to all people's campaign activists: if you know of anyone or you 
yourself are a designer, artist, whatever, who'd like to create a design(s) 
for potential campaign T-Shirts, please let me know. I have some ideas about 
designs but alas i'm not much for designing myself.

in addition to using the official logo of the campaign (which i don't think 
has been decided on yet) i'd like to create some hip campaign wear for the 
youth and other groups that wouldn't otherwise purchase the normal political 
tee (e.g. actually create t-shirts in size small and medium for smaller 
framed people)

of course, all logos and designs, i imagine, will be approved by the 
Steering committee.

3- we are investigating a potential Hip hop party fundraiser.

4- we will be having a RAFFLE, for drawing on April 21st. further details to 
be announced but keep in mind that we would like everyone to sell mountains 
and mountains of them....

5- potential big money fundraising dinners, to be planned for the future...

6- we are trying to get started a weekly people's campaign institution that 
will serve two functions: raising money and raising awareness. something 
small and low maintenance, but which begins to get the campaign into the 
minds of people in the community. Example: a weekly juice stand; weekly 
cheap vegetarian hot dinners; a weekly book sale via the campaign 
BookMOBILE; movie night, etc.

please forward your ideas to me as well. remember, the trick is LOW 
MAINTENANCE, and HIGH VISIBILITY. this may sound impossible at first, but i 
have faith....

IN addition, if anyone has any ideas in terms of big fundraising activities 
(E.G. a square dance, whatever!) please forward them to me. we want to 
organize events that address the diverse segments of new brunswick. So, if 
you know any hip hop artists (or other performers) personally who would be 
interested in performing, please let me know.
Also, we are in DIRE need of potential VENUES. so if your uncle's sister's 
cousin owns an auditorium or tavern somewhere and would be happy to let us 
use it, please let me know.

AND of course, we need people to participate in fundraising meetings. and 
i'm not talking about those of you who already attend 5.2 meetings per week. 
new blood.... fundraising....new faces....fundraising...

remember: it won't work without money (unfortunately!)

peace,

Kristina

Yes Great!  We were talking about this at last night's Media Committe
meeting (minutes to be posted shortly).  I think it's great that both
committees are seeing that this is a great idea...and taking action to
make it happen.  

There is a question though:  We don't want to have 2 committees invest
energy in this when that time and effort can be spent elsewhere.  I would
venture to say that coming up with the design and making contacts is the
media committee's area, as it is a walking billboard.  I can be completely
wrong about this - let's discuss.

I was in the process of doing research into places to get the t-shirts
printed up as well as starting to come up with designs, etc.  I don't know
if I should keep doing this. Maybe we can collaborate on each committee's
efforts.

Again, let's discuss who should field this one (sorry for the corporate
talk, I'm at work :) ).  Let's not needlessly waste anyone's effort :)

Wow...good thing that those minutes came out!  

Thanks!

Jessie

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] logo and website
Message:

Guys, hate me but Im putting this out here.  I think it is great that we have people on board designing our logo. This is a great gift. I feel very strongly against using the top logo, the people stomping on fat white cops and bureaucrats.  I think we would be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we did.  If we cant use the bottom one because of DSA (is this right) it would be great to have another to choose from.  I feel very strongly that we need to present ourselves as a constructive, forward moving group, rather than destructive and antagonistic.  I think we should focus on eliminating the current system of government, policy decisions, lack of representation and machine, rather than a campaign that focuses on attacking individual people.  Of couse, there will always be some crossover.  The tone of the first provides an inviting environment to newcomers, the tone of the second does not.

Maybe we can have one main logo and a few other logo/images that we use when it seems right.  Can we at least run a vote on the images across all our people on the membership list, both on and off email?  The point is an image is a powerful thing, it represents all of us, and just as we voted on our name I think we should vote on our logo.

I ran the top logo by a coworker who has created an organization inthe lower east side (The Lower East Side Collective) that was crucial in the recent local district elections and part of a coalition that staged a long, drawn-out, successful community-labor campaign that won a union for illegal immigrant greengrocers in their community. Prior to this she was active in the PIRGS.  I know I am a tightass so I needed a second opinion.  Her comments:

With this logo, we are going to get those that are politicized, those that are already communist.  But if our real goal is to reach a broader audience of people who arent politically active right now, regular folks, they'll probably be turned off.  If we are serious about building political power, we need to reach people we havent yet reached by the left.  This kind of imagery doesnt sell.

Awww... what's wrong with darkcartel.com?  ;)


In all seriousness, we have been discussing some potential domain names to
register.  
peoplescampaign.org is taken, as is newbrunswick.org (unfortunately, that
would have been a lot of fun :) ) We could undoubtedly get
nbpeoplescampaign.org, but that seems very convoluted.  nbpc.org is also
taken.   I could potentially look into the new freestyle domain names, but I
am not sure how those work.  I will investigate the potential.  In the
meanwhile, any other suggestions would be great.

Message:

First of all, allow me to express my pleasure at seeing actual discussion on
this list.  This is what we need more of, in all forms and coming from
progressives of all stripes -- dialogue.  Every bit of input, no matter how
benign or controversial, gives us more to think about and understand.  It
also brings us closer to each other, to understanding our respective
positions, and further down the path to an effective united front.

We had a discussion before at the Media Committee regarding the logo prior
to the two concepts were submitted.  The discussion was over the logo that
appeared on the last flyer for the convention, which contained an upraised
fist.  That logo was basically just clip art, it was not meant to be
permanent by any means.  But it was said that this would not do, because it
was somewhat overplayed, and people had many associations with it that would
result in the same effect you are concerned about.  

At the same time, we recognized that we were in fact in this with an
explicit message.  That message has everything to do with reclaiming
democracy from the cops and the bureaucrats, and doing it through both unity
(thus the symbolism of the people on top holding hands) and contempt for
social injustice and the corrupt 'representatives' who enable it to
flourish.  In no way does the logo inherently suggest 'communism' -- I
honestly don't know where that one came from.  And the people on the bottom
do not give me the appearance of being stomped on.  But I suppose it might
be somewhat like a Rorscharch of sorts... ;)

There are a great many people from diverse social strata who I associate
with on a regular basis.  It honestly does not take being terribly
politicized to see the blood and dirt on the hands of the establishment and
the corporate interests.  Those who choose to close their eyes to it to the
point of being antagonized by the logo itself, do not seem likely to be the
type to get involved in any case.

I would also like to hear suggestions with regard to content of an alternate
logo from those who share Zofia's view, so that I can pass them on to Mike
and we can put together some alternatives before a vote.

To those of you who haven't seen the logo, visit http://151.198.10.71

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] MINUTES COME THROUGH!!!!
Message:

I think we have seen the impact that communication through this listserv can 
afford...  as jess said, the media committee was also ruminating the t-shirt 
idea, but without further ado, the media minutes:

MINUTES FOR 3/8 MEDIA COMMITTEE MEETING

In attendance:  Keith, Errrrrrric, Nikki, Jess, Chris and Jim

PROGRESS:
-Chris and Jess come through on the start of our web page!!!  CHECK IT 
OUT!!!  It comes complete with a discussion board--so let's get to 
discussing!  We discussed the fact that we need to get other committees to 
submit info for the web page, preferably in e-form.
-There were two logos submitted by Mike the Wanderer, the favorite of the 
media committee was the one with the people holding a banner.  Jess is going 
to fix the logo so that it will fit on letterhead.  WE NEED INPUT FROM OTHER 
COMMITTEES ABOUT WHICH LOGO IS FAVORED! (thank you Zophia)
-Nikki is working on getting info for advertising in larger formats, like 
billboards.
-Keith finished the flyer for the caravan in April.
-The flyer request form will be put on the web page in the next couple of 
days, so that people can submit their requests via the net, REMEMBER 
REQUESTS ARE DUE ONE WEEK PRIOR TO NEED!
-Jim's letter to student and community organizations about the People's 
Campaign is complete and will be sent out next week.  Jim is also working on 
   a letter to the editor about the campaign.
-We also discussed the newsletter that the Steering Committee discussed.  It 
will be a 4-page newsletter in English and Spanish.  We will be in contact 
with Right-to-know to get research that we can put in newsletter form.  Any 
picture/graphic/article ideas are, of course, welcome.

FUTURE:
-Making banners for and set-up supplies for the next campaign meeting on the 
25th.  We need to make the place look more like a planning meeting.  We 
talked about making a big banner with our name on it, perhaps some posters.
-Make t-shirts and/or posters for either the campaign or to advertise the 
convention or the caravan.  Jess is looking into possible t-shirt places.
-Maintainance of the webpage will be done by Erric, Chris and Jess.  We will 
begin directly contacting people (esp. Chairs) to get info to put on the 
website.  It is important to keep this site interesting and dynamic--and 
also to get people actively involved in its content.
-We are going to be making a media strategy/plan so that we montior our 
visibility and make sure we are hitting a wide audience and getting our name 
out there as often as possible.

I think the logo with the people holding the banner is the best option out 
there right now.  I would love to see more options with hands or fists if 
anyone can think of any...  But a lot of these options are ALREADY out there 
from other organizations...but ultimately what we need is to gather as many 
potential logos as possible and vote on them on the 25th just as we voted on 
our official name.  Until then, we have to perhaps test the logos we have on 
people just as Zophia did.  I think we shouldn't get too caught up in the 
picture aspect of it.  We could always just have "People's Campaign" written 
in catchy lettering.  The key is that we want the symbol or lettering to be 
used on EVERYTHING and we want it to be recognizable as our campaign.  Would 
people feel better about just having stylized lettering rather than trying 
to come up with a graphic???  Let's just try to have this ironed out by or 
on the 25th!

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] letter on Pimp cops
Message:

This is a rough draft of a letter to the Home News

Dear Editor,

     The defense attorney's of New Brunswick police officers Marshall
and Chinchilla called the evidence against the officers "absurd" (Home
News Tribune 03/08/00) and asked that the charges be dismissed.  Were
the defense attorney's  emboldened to make this claim because State
Superior Court Judge Barnett Hoffman stated repeatedly that he "likes"
officer Marshall and that the two are friends? Hoffman arrogantly
reprimand the prosecutors for "building up a case".  The only thing
that  Judge Hoffman should dismiss is himself from the case because of
the conflict of interest. Hoffman's actions demonstrate the need for all
judges to be democratically elected.
    The defense and the police department as a whole have taken to
attacking the prosecution whiteness Corey Ashford who has provided tape
recorded evidence.  This evidence should be made public.  Ashford's
"record" has nothing to do with the guilt of these officers.
     The Home News Tribune has followed the lead of the court in using
the euphemism "official misconduct" to describe the shooting of  Officer
Marshall by Officer Chinchilla.  It is often described as a "phony
shooting".  The only problem is that there was nothing phony about it.
The officer shot at least 7  times in a residential neighborhood where
children play.  After one cop shot another cop, a police state emerged
in that neighborhood.  The officers described a suspect and though no
suspect existed many young black men were arrested for "questioning".
The evidence that these officers shot one another is more than
substantial. The report of the grand jury that cleared Officer Consalvo
of wrong doing in the murder of Sissy Adams, is filled with testimony of
relationships between New Brunswick police and New Brunswick
prostitutes.
     This case points to the crying need for an independent all elected,
all-civilian police review board with subpoena power.  Only a
independent body elected by the people with legal power can conduct a
serious investigation.  Finally this case testifies to the moral and
political bankruptcy of  New Brunswick's elected officials all of whom
have yet to say a word about this case.

Cutting ourselves off at the knees?  As if we are building this movement

The goal of this campaign (and the logo for that matter) is not to make
people communist.  In fact, I didn't gather anything from the logo that
would indicate communism, and I would be against introducing communism
or communist ideology into this.


I saw the image and interpretted it as symbolizing teamwork and
overcoming the obstacles of the administration we face.  It has nothing
to do with individuals, other than the individuals we are trying to
replace in office.

I would not be against considering other logos, but I don't particularly
sympathize with your criticisms of this one.  It actually seems pretty
docile to me.

A message from <a

<blockquote TYPE=CITE>Hello all.  I've been
working hard on producing
this documentary on <b>Mumia Abu Jamal</b> for the
past year and would
greatly appreciate your attendance...It's a screening
party for the trailer
/ fundraiser (we're still trying to raise money to
finish it):
<p>  You are invited to a preview screening of
<p>  <b>VOICE OF THE VOICELESS</b>
<br>  <i>The Life. The words. The movement.</i>
<p>  6-9:00pm
<br>  Wednesday 3/15/2000
<br>  A documentary film in the making
<br>  directed by Tania Cuevas-Martinez
<br>  produced by Tatiana Litvin
<p>  Bar 13 (Los Angeles)
<br>  35 E. 13th street
<br>  (corner of University and 13th St.)
<br>  w/ DJ Daai Lo and friends
<p>  Donate $5 or more seeds and watch us grow
<p>  This project started as a compilation album
of which a portion
of the proceeds are going to benefit Mumia Abu-Jamal's
defense fund (who
I'm sure all of you know has been in prison for 18
years for a crime most
international human rights committees have agreed that
he did not commit).
The first single, entitled "Mumia 911" featured Afu
Ra,  SlimKid Tre
(Pharcyde), Wise Intelligent (Poor Righteous Teachers)
Aceyalone, p.e.a.c.e.
(Freestyle Fellowship), Zach de la Rocha (Rage Against
The Machine), Divine
Styler, Channel Live, Tragedy, Goldi Locks (Mumia's
daughter), The Last
Emperor, Black Thought (The Roots), Dead Pres, Pharaoh
Monch (Organized
Konfusion) and Chuck D (Public Enemy) and was produced
by Diamond D.
<p>  A camera crew was brought in during the time
of recording to
film interviews with all of the artists who
participated, conducted by
Bonz Malone.  The film is very powerful. 
Bonz takes each MC
off guard when he asks each one of them if they are
ready to die for the
cause.  Their reactions vary greatly and offer
incredible insight
into the world of hip-hop activism and the realization
of the power such
a movement can wield. In addition to this, the film
will have a broader
purpose which is to examine the state of the
revolution.
<p>  This film is different than other
documentary's we have seen
on Mumia.  We are able to show the personal side
of Mumia, as a man,
rather than as a criminal or martyr.  We shot
footage of his mother
and daughter at his home in Philadelphia, personal
stories are told and
family photos are shown.  We get an incredible
sense of who Mumia
really is, how his strong social conscience led him to
do the work he did,
We also see how contrary all of that is to any
depiction of him being a
murderer.
<p>  The documentary, Voice of the Voiceless, as
of now has no distribution. 
(Although I work at Interscope, the label has no
involvement with this
project).
<p>  This screening is for potential investors
but even if you are
not interested in investing, I would appreciate you
checking it out and
letting me know what you think.
<p>  Thanks.
<p>  -Tat
<p>

Does anyone have time to go today at 5 and at least pick up a copy of the agenda?  Let me know if you can because Im coordinating a flyer drop on the issues for Tuesday.

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Fundraising dinner!
Message:

Hi there,

There will be a fundraising dinner for the People's campaign on Saturday 
evening at 5:00 pm at 218 George Street, New Brunswick (F. Bright's house). 
This will be a rather low-key affair, but we invite all to come. The charge 
will be a $3 minimum (more if you have it) for a vegetarian pasta dinner. 
This will take place after the canvassing on Saturday afternoon, so it will 
be a great opportunity to relax, debrief, socialize, and prepare for the 
ARTHouse 559 event in the evening. For more information, contact Frank at 
249-7201.

Volunteers to prepare food, etc. would be great. Please contact me.

ADDITIONALLY:

The need is great for people to participate in the fundraising committee. If 
you know of any new people who are looking to get involved, please point 
them in our direction... Thanks!

Kristina

Message:

Tomorrows City Council meeting will cover a bunch of different topics, including the following: 

- seemingly standard handicapped parking additions and deletions and changes in loading areas
- instituting charge for photocopying birth certificate/running open-ended searches on certificates
- approvals for street closings/festivals
- approval for redevelopment plan change on the tall building behind the County courthouse - since a developer is planning to redevelop it into office space and apartments, the City is imposing a parking requirement and a "building envelope" requirement - they want the outside to be redone so it matches the current style they are promoting instead of the old modernism.   (City planning board recommended this, was concerned about 'spot zoning' and parking density)
- approval to move the sites of a few Henry Oliver affordable housing units to another nearby area for the development because someone bought one of the plots/renovated and so the price of properties went up. 
-RCA agreement (regional contribution agreement) with Bethlehem I think for up to 9 affordable housing units.  Because of the Mount Laurel Court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, in NJ currently each municipality must plan for a certain amount of affordable housing to be built within the municipality.  However, they can get around a portion of their obligation by giving the monies ($20,000 per unit in this case) to urban centers toward build the required affordable housing units.  On the one hand, it gets affordable housing builit in a time when Congress has completely cut back their funding for HUD.  On the other hand, it ends up maintaining the class segregation, and the system remains since central cities benefit from the RCA provision - one of the dwindling ways to get monies to support subsidized housing.  So its good that NB is getting these monies, but the larger picture is morbid.

I was going to flyer for this this time around, I dont know if it is worth it since there is nothing too big happening I think.

Ill send the future posted dates to all tomorrow, we should put them up on the website too.

The planning board will be meeting for site plan approval of Monument Square Block proposal April 12, without any delays.  We are currently investigating the details of this 15 story building with 200 luxury apartments, 200 hotel rooms, a convention center and training facility that will go in on Livingston and George.  We should see what we can get out of this for the community - cheap or free leasing space in the Convention Center to make it publicly accessible seems a minimum, although I dont know yet how we can have this happen,  since we have no catch - it does not require any variances unfortunately.  However the businesses will be displaced and it will dramatically shift traffic flows so there might be some catch there.  You should know the thing will be hideous.  High inhuman modernism, worse than the Bloustein builidng.  The current bankrupted hotel there is only 10 or so stories high.

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] banners for motorcade on April 1
Message:

Hi all, I spoke with our artist friend Jabari about banners designs for the 
motorcade. I wanted to put out the ideas we came up with b4 we moved to make 
the banners. We're doing that at my house, 559 Hamilton St. Somerset 
729-0873. That'll be on Friday night, the 17th at 7pm. Please come and help. 
We need people with a steady hand and people who want to take part in an 
assembly line making placards and signs.

The first banner we discussed would feature a bunch of figures holding up a 
bunch of buildings made to look like a skyline, with city hall- and office- 
and housing- looking buildings. There would be a slogan on top and "New 
Brunswick People's Campaign" on the bottom.

The other would advertise the convention, with a huge "May 13" on one side 
and faces that looked like those on the other banner on the other side. 
Below the faces it would say "Your City Council" "Your Platform" "Your 
People's Convention". Across the top would read "New Brunswick People's 
Campaign".

Let me know what you think. And come over on Saturday night too, for 
Arthouse559. Poetry, Music, Singing Spoken Word Jam celebrating progressive 
and revolutionary culture and forging new relationships. $5 at the door to 
benefit the People's Campaign. Bring a book for Jersey Youth Correctional 
Facility's Prison Library and pay $4.

Paul   729-0873 or leave a msg on NJFO hotline. 545 5756.

Zofia, Thanks for the great detailed update. That's good info. Is it true 
that when the site plan goes through, the development is out of the public's 
hands legally?  Also, with those RCAs, there was an article published 
recently in the HNT stating that significant RCA monies, $1mm I think, will 
be put towards DEMOLITION of buildings in NB Homes, to supplement HOPE VI. 
Is this common practice? Can Mount Laurel be twisted any more? Paul

The items in the agenda are standard. McGee's comments stand. Nota Bueno 
about the birth certificate search stuff: it is a pure revenue mechanism 
which has been going up and up for the last several years. Think of it 
as a cash cow barometer of the actual fiscal state of the city. Wait 
until the temporary budget ceases and the city actually has to have one 
certified by the State. Ten dollars versus one, you'll see a tax 
increase.

State Level Municipal Land Use Law sets the legal standard. - providing the boundaries of coverage of the local zoning ordinance, and supplementing it.  We still need to look into what we can do legally. Members of the planning board are very concerned about transportation issues - so while that may not be our paramount concern, that may be something we can emphasize.  Also, this building is receiving state funding, so we have the public interest argument on our side in negotiations that could take place outside of the formal approval process.

Congrats to all the folks who joined the canvass this 
past week-end. Spirits were high, we got a lot of 
surveys filled, and most important, we talked to a lot 
of people who want to join the campaign. WE STILL NEED 
TO SEE MORE NEW FACES! The Right to Know Committee sent 
the word that they are all coming to canvass this coming 
Saturday. How about the other committees? The City 
Machine will pour corporate money on the streets of New 
Brunswick like acid rain and we must match everyone of 
their dead dollars with the live energy of our 
volunteers committed to people's democracy. Let us all 
show we are up to the challenge. Sisters & brothers of 
the People's Campaign, come and talk to the PEOPLE!

UNITE, ORGANIZE, SEIZE POWER!

Canvassers meet at the New Brunswick Public Library on

Xavier put a slogan at the bottom of his message, "UNITE, ORGANIZE, SEIZE 
POWER!" So far, we don't have official slogans and logos and such. But on 
Friday we're going to make the banners and signs for the motorcade on the 
first of April. (Please come to 559 Hamilton St. right across from 
Krauszer's at 7p.m. to help.)

Yesterday I proposed that we put a logo featuring people holding up the 
image of a city onto one of the banners instead of the logo on the website 
and flyers. I spoke to Xavier about this and he pointed out that the already 
circulated logo has wide support and that it would be a mistake to place 
another logo onto banners, etc. I agreed with him and so I'm withdrawing the 
suggestion I made yesterday.

We're making two banners, so one more banner has to be made. I'm still 
suggesting we use that one to advertise the convention in May. I also think 
we should include the "Organize, Unite, Seize Power!" slogan on the second 
banner. Please tell me what you think, everybody. If people have specific 
ideas, please tell me or come on Friday. Anyone with artistic ability or who 
wants to do some fun work should come also. Thanks for feedback, Paul

PS-Come to 559 Hamilton Saturday night for Arthouse559 @ 8 p.m. Poetry music 
open mike spoken word, good company. $5 to benefit the people's campaign. $4 
with a book for prison library (no harlequins, please)

Hi folks,

I would like again to ask that we not use the logo we have been using, and ask at least for a vote from all members.  I think it has a violent tone and we will scare people away.  I also think we should use Take Back the Power rather than "Seize" for the same reason.  I do not see this as different ideologically in what we plan to do - it is a matter of communicating to people.  I understand the "other side" has done violence via their policies and actions.  But I do not think we can build a campaign through a focus on retaliation.

personally like it and I think the vast majority agree. If we can get an

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Re: Logo
Message:

Some thoughts in response to Zofia's concerns about the campaign logo & use 
of term "seize":

I thought she was being overly cautious, as this is a time for the people's 
forces to be agressive, to strike while the iron's hot, if you will.  Too 
often forces on the left have been softened by elements that could be 
considered a "loyal opposition", who would be resistant to mounting a 
serious offensive targeting the imperialist achilles heel...democracy.  Of 
course we seek to draw a clear line of demarcation from such opportunism.

That said, Webster defines "SEIZE" as "to lay hold of or take by force" & 
"to attack or overwhelm physically".  Considering Malcolm X's ultimatum: The 
Ballot or the Bullet, the Peoples' Campaign is clearly-and wisely-taking the 
former path, as this is what current conditions warrant.  Therefor the 
question remains:  Are we seeking to "take by force" the NB City Hall?  Or 
does this position imply "The Bullet"?  Malcolm X also said that we must 
defend ourselves "by any means necessary."  What is necessary at this stage 
of the struggle is to continue mounting an United Front Offensive for 
People's Democracy.  In the literal sense, "seize" does not seem to reflect 
this stage.  Recall that in the War Against Iraq, the Imperialists first 
used "Desert Shield"  while negotiations were still underway.  It wasn't 
until the military offensive that "Desert Storm" was adopted.

The aim of the slogan should reflect the current state as well as the 
objectives of the movement. At this point it is to reach as broad a base as 
possible in order to insure a victory for the people come November.  It 
would be an error if the campaign slogan isolated possible allies by being 
"ahead" of where the movement is.  Therefore, unless the case can be made 
that  taking the struggle to the Ballot Box (Even into the streets) implies 
SEIZING power, I have to agree with Zofia...Take Back the Power seems 
appropriate enough. Or "Take the Power Back" would regester with anyone 
who's familliar with Tribe Called Quest and we would have a serious 
contender for an Official Campaign song!

Finally- RE: Logo concerns:  I think that the concept Paul wrote about for 
the banner is great:  A crowd or group of people holding up builings made to 
look like City Hall, Offices, Schools, Apartments, Etc. Kind of a "Whose 
City? Our City!" statement.  This could make a great logo.

Well, if this is already been decided, so be it.  I still think that Zofia 
has had some valid points that at least could be flushed out in discusion.  
What does it mean to SEIZE POWER?  This level of struggle is a new 
experience for many of us, and it would be prudent to address such concerns 
as they arise.

(Unfortunately, I have to follow many of these developments as they

Matt, in your definition, you stated "to lay hold of or take by force". "OR" 
is the crucial point here. Aren't we trying to lay hold of more power? I 
think "Take the power back" implies we once had power. The majority has 
never had power. I vote to keep "Seize power". As far as banners go, I still 
say go with the one that's popular in the campaign. We'll finalize 
everything at the meeting, but time demands we make the banner ahead of the 
motorcade.  Paul

Based on my understanding of the logo issue, I am for a vote and for 
"Take" as opposed to "Seize." If the traditional democratic party base

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Logo & Slogan
Message:

Any permanent logo and slogan for the campaign should be 
voted on at a General Meeting or the Convention. 

In the meantime, one logo banner is being made for the 
first of many upcoming motorcades/public events. The 
media committee came up with a logo as they were asked 
to do and we should use them until we get to vote unless 
there is overwhelming opposition. So far the majority of 
both the Media and Outreach Committees support the logo. 
The logo should be replaced if a majority votes against 
it at the next general meeting. I support this logo 
because it honestly portrays that this campaign is a 
struggle between classes with opposing interests. The 
many people I spoke to during the canvass already know 
that J&J rules New Brunswick at their expense. Just 
about everyone of them said it to me very plainly. What 
they want to see before they join the campaign is that 
WE are not NAIVE and are prepared to struggle against 
the powers that be to win the elections. I think the 
logo is a step in that direction.

The slogan I used at the end of my last e-mail is NOT an 
official slogan of the campaign at this time. Actually 
Keith came up with it. He phrased it "Organize, Unite, 
Seize Power". Any slogan for the campaign should be 
voted on at the next meeting, etc. etc. I used this 
slogan in my e-mail for the same reason I support the 
logo. It is honest. Political power will NOT be simply 
handed over to the people of New Brunswick. The City 
Machine will not "play fair". In past campaigns, the 
machine used all forms of intimidation (cops with hands 
on holsters advancing menacingly on Afro-American would-
be voters), fraud (dead people voting many times) and 
harassment (one candidate for Mayor received bogus 
littering fines, another found all four of his tires 
flat on the morning of the elections) to keep an iron 
grip on power. The people KNOW THIS. They need to know 
that WE DO before they take the very real risk of openly 
defying the city machine. The cops so far haven't 
viciously brutalized or killed any Euro-American 
student, only Afro-Americans and Latinos...they are very 
aware of this, and so must we be. 

As a last point, I would advise all sisters and brothers 
in the campaign to be a little less concerned about 
alienating the middle class and a little more concerned 
about alienating the Afro-American and Latino workers 
and the students who make up the overwhelming majority 
of the city and who will NOT get involved in a half-
hearted attempt to take on a whole(stone cold, vampiric)
hearted enemy.

In unity,

Xavier.

i'd be very happy to participate in an on-line vote regarding the logos. i 
thought they had to be approved by the steering committee before anything 
happened anyway? can i get some clarity on that?

well, in any case, can someone send the logos out as graphic images onto 
this discussion list, to refresh everyone's memory, including my own? it'd 
be much appreciated.

Zofia, i understand your concerns about the images and the word "sieze", 
though i disagree. however, i think this is an important discussion that 
should occur at the next campaign meeting and resolved through a democratic 
election.

Message:

Matt, I would like you to clarify what the distinction is between "middle
class" and "working class" in your perception.  Or do you identify the
middle class with capitalists?  If the working class does not include the
middle class, then we certainly are not talking about "the majority"
anymore.

Just a thought -- seems relevant to me.  I work, and I am middle class.

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Working Class/ Middle Class
Message:

Chris,

I too work, and hard!--when I'm not bogged down with being a student as of 
late ;]--however, I do not consider myself to be "working class" per se.  I 
am the sole proprietor of a small carpentry business.  I own my own work 
vehicle and my own tools.  If I don't want to go to work in the morning, I 
don't because nobody can fire me.  I would say that my relationship to 
production is "petty bourgeois" in nature, albeit at the smallest scale 
possible & democratically inclined.

"Middle Class" is propaganda terminology, effectively enforcing the Labor 
Aristocracy which the Bourgeoisie (Capitalist ruling class) use to keep the 
majority of the working class in check. It's used much in the same way as 
"American Dream" is used.  These terms usually conjur up the myth of what 
America promises to those who go along with things (ala Forrest Gump)  Most 
working class people that I know consider themselves middle-class, and have 
the ideas and aspirations of the ruling class, i.e. their boss, Rush 
Limbaugh, Hollywood, etc.  As such, this consciousness is imbued with 
character traits of the ruling class: individualism, me-ism, consumerism, 
etc.

Like I said, I can opt to not go to work in the morning, or to seek a 
lucrative renovation contract that will make organizing less economically 
appealing.  Most students/intellectuals can go home to their parents, or ask 
them to send money.  Professionals tend to become quite comfortable in this 
"booming" ecomony.  Artists tend to become consumed by themselves (I'm 
speaking from experience!)  All of these "Classes" have characteristics that 
make them unreliable AS A CLASS.  Why?  It's not because they are all bad or 
mean spirited.  It's because their class interests tending towards 
individualism, etc. as stated, making them vulnerable to being divided, 
prone to react in SELF interest & expose them to the character traits of the 
ruling class pumped out by their multi-faceted media for mass consumption.

My understanding of "working class" are folks who have a boss & don't own 
the means of production, not to mention the goods they produce.  They are 
generally payed a small fraction of the wealth they produce. They can be 
fired, downsized, de-unionized, & un-benifited, etc. As such, they have 
common interests and a common struggle.  Ideally, unions themselves are an 
expression of this.  (Again, this is thwarted with the Labor Aristocracy, 
Sell Out Union Bosses, etc.)

As far as this concerns the NB Peoples Campaign:  I stated that I agree with 
X that we need to be less concerned with isolating the so-called "Middle 
Class" and more concerned allying with the working class.  New Brunswick is 
still a working class town.  The minute you step off the college campuses, 
this is makes itself apparent.  I don't have figures to back this up, but my 
5-6 years of living in NB confirm that most people are working Joes & Janes 
who, when it comes right down to it, have similar concerns, similar 
grievances against the machine, and simliarly have very little clout with 
the Machine to get their demands realized--aka: Political Power.  
Furthuremore, their economic status makes them the most willing to fight in 
a consistant way.  They have the family ties, the social networks, children 
in schools, the knowledge of how things work and how to organize their lives 
to survive.

So the workers TOGETHER with the the artists, the intellectuals and the 
professionals, etc. who support the democratic struggle & join the united 
front will make this happen.  We are all under assault by this system.  
Ideas cannot proliferate, the environment is being devestated, mediocrity in 
music, the arts and architecture has become the norm, science is 
prostituted, history washed away.  This is why we say that since 10% of the 
people control 90% of the wealth, then the other %90 of the people have some 
reason to unite and, (dare I say...) SEIZE POLITICAL POWER!

Matthew Smith

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Right to Know
Message:

Zophia- I have couple of Right to Know items to lay on you as well. Pat 
Whalen--Attornius Stupendus--had sent me a recent article about the 
conviction of one Attornius Corruptus, Ms. Linda Anderson (no relation) 
whose case we've been following for awhile (She's tied to the city  machine 
up to her neck & is likely a weak link for them.)  You might consider 
calling Paul to ask if he's contacted Curtis.  According to Paulie, Curtis 
has alot of the Coalition Documents in storage (RE: Research on Right to 
Know info, &ct.) We may want to sit down with Paul, Curtis, Janice, Sam, 
Linda & discuss how to 1.)Tie the coalition's efforts in with the Peoples 
Campaign, & 2) Get some of these things roling again.  For instance the 
Coalition was/is a phone call away from advancing their Right to Know 
lawsuit (w/ NJFO) into the courts.  This according to Renee Steinhagen of 
the NJ Public Interest Law Center who wrote up our RTK Request origninally.  
Anyhow, Paul has the necessary contacts.  I'll be at Paul's Friday night, 
Saturday all day.  Matthew Smith

Message:

I concur.  My experience with this event has been that any issues detracting 
focus of it's core message may be frowned upon by it's participants and 
organizers.  It may however be worth a contact to organizers of the event to 
gauge their interest in the mission of NB Peoples Campaign and have them 
suggest ways, if any, for us to work together.  This could be an additional 
opportunity to bridge the gap between the NB and University women's community.

Message:

Less than a few hours after the last post, between 10:30 and 11:30 tonight,
the campaign site was hacked, and several key directories were removed.

We have some backups, but not all -- we figured that we would suffer attack,
but there was not enough there to warrant an effort at this point... damn.

Just a heads-up to those who are wondering why the site is not operational.
The next one will have seriously beefed-up security, which I am already
planning for.  We need to keep in mind what we are up against here...

My brain is rattled, and I'm going to bed.  I'll keep you abreast of any
further developments.

Message:

Right to Know Committee
Minutes 3/18/00

Agenda

1. Review last weeks minutes of meeting
2. Review Council meeting and planning board
3. Integration of work that coalition against police brutality
4. Getting on egroups
5.  Voter reg update
6.  Discuss approach to work
7.  Redevelopment update
8.  Brian's info on tax policy

1.  Review of last weeks minutes.  New law - increased absorb beyond 55% of 
all new capital construction to be covered by the state of NJ.

3.  Coalition Against Police Brutality has extensive files, around Sissy 
Adams and RTK lawsuit.  They would like to brung this to us, work together 
and start plowing through some of it.  They have all the depositions of the 
Consalvo and Marshall and Chinchilla case.  The coalition wrote a request w/ 
Renee Steinhagen, Director of the NJ Public Interest Law Center - she just 
represented the 14 black state cops.  There is a 10 pt request demanding 
information - from very general history of police complaints, plus the 
personnel files of Kenneth Milroy �Crater Face� - includes points on many 
people.  The requests for informaiton were denied, and after a series of 
requests the next step is to bring a court case against the City of New 
Brunswick, the NB Prolice Department, and the Middlesex County Prosecutors 
office.  At this time, there is a new case  that surfaced - a lawyer Linda 
Anderson - was stealing money - she was Officer Zane Gray�s lawyer, then 
Potts family advocate, and did not support the Potts family vis a vis the 
justice system at all.  There is an investigation by Robert Regan on Zane 
Gray.  In the summertime, everything was ready to move forward.  Renee 
emailed the Coalition about this legal action recently - we need to call her 
and move forward.  RTK call members of Coalition, get on board, sit down with 
their information, archive it to move foreward with this request.  This can 
work in conjunction with the current right to know demands at the state 
level.  X said that legal work will probably be moved to the RTK committee, 
although he is currently coordinating the legal efforts.  F has a concern 
regarding legal coordination.   Beyond this, Paul has a tentative plan of 
action formulated for a couple months down the road.  Matt will call Renee.  
Frank will be the liaison to gather all the information from Curtis.  Q:  
What do we want to produce?  When the news came out in the paper regarding 
the release of Marshall and Chinchilla, we as a group did not have enough 
information to respond appropriately - so we all need to be up to speed.  
Paul will find out the exact status of the Coalition Against Police 
Brutality.  Q of whether Peoples Campaign should join with Coalition Against 
Police Brutality.  Matt will ask Renee for process of NJFO.  Frank will call 
Matt on history of Coalition Against Police Brutality.  We need to develop a 
broader police platform.  

Can we view peoples names on the egroups and what msgs people sent?

We discussed the concern of posting our minutes on the egroups.  This info is 
public.  Anyone can go to the group and download the archives of messages - 
it could give the other side the heads up on our actions, could come out on 
the front page of the Home News, and it is possible that someone could be 
sued as a result of the discussions.  Also, some people are not entering 
discussion on the egroup to protect themselves, and this limits the 
discussion.  One suggestion was to create a separate more restricted egroup 
only for members - so noone could look at the posted or the list of names on 
the egroup, and a moderator would ensure it is only for members.  This would 
be for minutes, polemics, strategy.  The egroups would be just for 
announcements. Lets wait to post minutes until we talk to the steering 
committee.

A second question was raised - how can we make sure that those not on email 
get the minutes.  It should be the job of the committee leaders to print out 
minutes from each group and pass them out to their members who do not have 
access.

Updates:  City council, voter reg, planning board

Message:

Frank--Regarding concern of Libel issues/rumors relating to information 
posted on egroup from RTK minutes:

Perhaps it is enough just to say that "this and that were discussed; more 
pending...".  We can then come foward when information is concrete.  We 
should avoid getting our signals crossed right now.

(For instance, it's unlikely that the Coalition has ALL depositions from 
Consalvo/ Marchal/ Chinchilla cases.  What we do have we were given in 
confidence, on account of peculiar nature of "source" relationship to case, 
etc.  Let us look at what exists, make an assessment on how to proceed and 
come out strong.)

*Zophia did check with me about what to include in the minutes post, and I 
told her that getting info out widely is key to our security.  I still think 
this is true, but realize that we must be tight, not give reason for city to 
discredit us or our information.  --Matthew

Message:

Sorry for the late notice on this one - I called several tims with no response.

The Suydam Street Reformed Church is conducting a peace march today on behalf of the people of Vieques in Puerto Rico - many know the story of the US military base that has destroyed this beautiful area and self-sustaning community, ruined the fisheries, prayed on the people via test bombing.  I think the bombing was halted temporarily due to massive demonstrations - people actually camped directly on the site with continual vigils to the point of setting up new community facilities; and that the bombing is set to resume soon.  Anyway, the Peoples Campaign is welcome to join, it starts at Brower Commons at 5pm and ends at the church at 630 at 74 Drift St for an ecumenical service.  This is an opportunity to support an important cause in the fight against imperialism.

I would add a report from the Steering Committee.  And after that

effectively keeping or reconstituting that body.

Message:

Here's some interesting data to support a platform point on a rent 
cap/increased gov't subsidies for low-income public housing*:

For Middlesex County:

Fair Market Rent for 2 Bedroom  Apartment:            $   960
Annual Income Needed to Afford:                       $38,400
Hourly Wage Needed to Afford:                         $    18.46
       (Tied with Somerset Co. for highest in state!)

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Monument Square Block
Message:

Note from a fellow researcher on the Monument Square Block development:

I spoke with a NB planning department official the other day.  He informed 
me that the Monument Square redevelopment project is owned and will be 
developed by DEVCO and that it will not require any zoning variances.  (He 
said that even if it did -- and it sounds like it may require a FAR variance 
--  the redevelopment agency can override the city's planning board approval 
process, something that sounds quite strange to me!)

I asked him about tax abatements and he told me that the project would pay 
some city taxes but no county tax.  I left a message on Glenn Paterson's 
voice mail (Glenn Paterson is the head of NB's planning department) but so 
far he hasn't returned my call.

The person I spoke with also seemed unsure of when, exactly, the project 
would be up for approval.  He said it would on the schedule for either April 
12 or April 26.  You may want to phone up the week before the 12th to find 
out.

It seems to me that -- provided what the NB planning official told me is 
accurate and that I understood him correctly -- you will find answers to 
most of your questions in the legislation/regulations connected to the New 
Brunswick redevelopment agency (or whatever they call it).  If projects 
submitted by that agency do indeed supersede the city's own planning board 
approval process, then it really doesn't matter what the planning board and 
its members do or think.  To the degree that the redevelopment agency is 
unelected (which I believe it is) and has veto power over the planning 
board, the whole arrangement appears vaguely unconstitutional, don't you 
think?

Of course, I'm not sure if what I was told by the planning board official is 
accurate or if I understood it correctly.  But if I were you, I would check 
it all out and maybe go see a lawyer.  I'll keep you apprised of any new 
information that comes my way.

Just a note to say that the DOT hearing on road widening is today, March 28th  4-8  at the ground floor of the County Administration building.  This is an opportunity to tell folks to solve the traffic problems with improved public transit, not 4 lanes each way on Rt 18.

Message:

Hey all,
    Just a few thought on Route.  I was under the impression that the DOT 
spent a bunch of money just a few years ago on a traffic flow improvement 
project.  Essentially, the DOT computerized all of the traffic lights from 
New Brunswick through Spotswood by the Seville Diner.  This was done by 
sensors in the road to monitor traffic flow increases, breakdowns, accidents, 
and adjust the duration of traffic lights to handle traffic accordingly.  
This was done in an effort to avoid expanding the highway to 4 lanes each 
direction.
    Where exactly are they looking to expand this?  Let me know, I have 
pretty extensive contacts into the engineering community in Middlesex County. 
  Information regarding DOT shouldn't be too difficult for me to dig up.  
Keep me in the loop and let me know your questions and thought.  I should be 
able to handle some of the research on this from Boston.  Later,
Jim.

Just found out the traffic light project cost roughly 2 to 4 million for the 
upgrade.  I would suggest someone bring up this point at the meeting and 
request some data regarding this project.  If the DOT spent this sort of 
money on an upgrade, they should be forced to address the issue of this 
failure.

I think that DevCo is just such a quasi public private org that has these rights.

My concern overall is the lack of community uses in the building esp one calling itself a traiing center (although we need to see if perhaps they will be servicng the community, the luxury apartments, the decline in retail space. i spoke with a businessman next door and he agreed that soon the sm businesses will be priced out of the market on George St.  He had the idea for a business cluster or village as he called it where there was alot of business space, people could sell their wares formally and informally, rent space, and where the prices would be controlled and local people would be preferred.  We should assemble a business roundtable with this guy in it.  He was contacted by the city b/c he lies within 200 ft of the development - they are arranging to spraywash his building b/c of the dust, replace his facade if it gets messed up from the demolition, and halp with parking.  His business will benefit alot from the increased business.  Another business in the acutal block said they are receiving $10K + another $10K in relocation costs plus moving costs.  the First 10K is standard, state relocation costs for busiensses - even up to $15K I think.  The city may be supplementing.  They have been told there will be space but they are not certain where they will move.  The relocator has been working very close to them and they are on a first name basis.

From David:

I spoke with the NB planning director this afternoon.  He told me that:

1) The proposed Monument Square redevelopment project will meet most
requirements of the Downtown Redevelopment Plan and will therefore not
require much in the way of variances, although it may possibly require
some minor set-back variances;
2) The Downtown Redevelopment Plan is a part of NB's master plan (and
thus it was probably approved at some point by the city -- DG);
3) The developer of the project is DEVCO;
4) The project will generate between $900,000 and $1,000,000 per year in
tax revenue, even with the abatements.  According to the planning
director, it will generate more revenue with the abatements than without
them since Middlesex County, and not NB, is foregoing tax revenue and
kicking back part of its share to the city (thus, the County and not the
City is apparently granting the partial tax abatement);
5) The properties currently on the site generate less than $200,000 per
year in city tax revenue;
6) People living on the proposed site will be relocated elsewhere -- I
assume by NB or by DEVCO (I didn't ask where);
7) The Monument Square redevelopment project will receive the same type
of tax abatements as have other Downtown Redevelopment projects.
8) The Planning Board will most-likely vote on the project in May and
not in April.

Given all of this -- and I think it would be wise to review the NB
Master Plan and the Downtown Redevelopment Plan, as well as any indirect
subsidies that the city may be granting to DEVCO, where the site's
current residents will be relocated to, what potential traffic problems
the proposed development may create (I forgot to ask him about the
traffic impact), etc. & etc. -- what, exactly, would be your objections
to the project?  I think you should think it through very carefully,
especially if you want to oppose it.  Is a Subway sandwich shop and a
bankrupt hotel a better use for the site than the proposed use?  Are
there any alternative uses that may be better?  (Sure there are, but are
they feasible -- that's the important question to answer.)

Back in the day when they built the Hyatt, etc., Devco was public-private

We're not in a position to stop big projects like this. We have to hang on 
like dingleberries and squeeze concessions from them. We may not be able to 
help small business in the immediate area, but we should move to help small 
bus. elsewhere in town. We can push for increased subsidies for essential 
programs and new institutions to run them, tax abatements for small business 
too, lower sales tax, etc. This should be emphasized both within and without 
the big developments, with training and jobs downtown and money for new 
institutions to democratically revitalize other areas of town. We should say 
"You develop here, you fund our development over there"--Paul

Message:

Paul's right-   Up here in the Bricks, inevitable construction of the Nets 
Arena is looming like a Zeplin.  Right now we don't have control of the 
rudder, but we can force a seat at the bargaining table...with enough 
pressure.
   This is what is driving the Lincoln Park/Coast Cultural District project 
right now.  When we had our recent Dance/Gala at Symphony Hall to promote 
the concept, Amiri made sure that we put EVERYBODY's name that was remotely 
associated with the effort on the flyer (this included community developers, 
Prudential employees, architects, cultural & political activists, etc.)  It 
wasn't a cosmetic thing, because once people's names were attached to it, it 
forced many talkers into doing.  (This is not to detract from the many 
people who really poured their energies into the effort.)
   Because of this we've been able build enough momentum to get us to the 
point at which we find ourselves now:  the Mayor of Newark has pledged $2500 
start up fee for our Newark-NJ-Store kiosk(our Cultural Ambassodor & 
Economic Generator)& to allow us to install the kiosk in City Hall lobby, 
with an additional pledge to help put together a $25,000 block grant for the 
same.  And we will be negotiating with the Nets/Yankees about installing the 
Nwk-NJ-Store in the new stadium; same with Rick Cerrone, owner of Newark 
Bears, in new stadium.

Figure out what concessions NB residents need (Cultural Institution, 
INDEPENDANT Teen Center, Women's Center, Mid-Night basket ball, whatever)  
use the united front to promote issues/build momentum. NAG THE SHIT out of 
the city to get behind it.  Make them the "Outsider".  Isolate them.  The 
development of Monument Square will go through.  Like Paul says, see what we 
can squeeze out of it for the People of NB.  (You might even consider 
following the model of the Newark-NJ-Store: Cultural Ambassodor of the 
People & Independant Economic Generator for the Movement)

Kristina, this is something I have been saying since the very beginning: 
That the chairs of each committee should be part of the steering committee 
or BE the Steering Committee.  This, I feel, would make things much more 
streamlined and there would be a real central point of communication -- not 
just at these monthly meetings.  Then overlap wouldn't occur because 
veryone would know what each committee has in mind.

This seems to be an issue that I raised a while ago.  I'm still doing
research on t-shirts and we also had plans for buttons...we need to decide
who is doing what or if this should be a collaborative effort.  

Maybe fundraising should find out pricing and then see what we can do as
far as our budget can handle...and media will do design?

Just a suggetion, 

Jessie

Structure we don't need?  How much overlap do we actually know about?  We 
only found out about this because the minutes were posted.  What if they 
weren't?  We'd have lots of different t-shirt and buttons and spent twice 
as much money.  I don't think that it is overkill or too much to ask to 
have people who decided to become the chairs of their committees to be the 
"go-betweens."

Subject:[nbpeoplescampaign] Clearing committee matters up
Message:

Why don't we save ourselves some banter and every committee chair write a 
fairly detailed description of the committee duties. I really think we're 
making this way more complicated than it needs to be...  yes, there may be 
some overlap, but that's why we communicate frequently.  Let's try to have 
descriptions up on the webpage by early next week.  (email them to chris) 
There's already a media description up, but I'll add to it.  Basically it's 
the job of the media committee to create visibility around the campaign.  
This would lead me to believe that the media committee will design the 
t-shirt and the fundraising committee will tell us how much money there is 
to work with.  Let's get those descriptions up!

Subject: A Letter of Apology to Elian Gonzales from Michael Moore
Date: Fri, 31 Mar 2000 19:15:37 EST

March 31, 2000

Dear Elian,

Please forgive me for writing to you in English.
Three semesters of Spanish, and I can't
remember a thing!

Also, please forgive us Americans for standing
back and allowing the child abuse you are now
experiencing. Normally, in this country, we arrest
adults who put children through trauma and
exploitation. Normally, we arrest adults like the
Mayor of Miami who call for violence and incite a
riot. Normally, in this country, we arrest terrorists
and either jail or deport them.

Unfortunately for you, we are doing none of this.
I apologize. I can only imagine what you are
going through. You do not deserve this
treatment.

You are being told that your mother died trying
to bring you to freedom. I am so sorry to have
to tell you, that's not true. The Cuban court
granted your father custody of you, and your
mother decided to kidnap you. She placed your
life in horrible jeopardy by putting you in a
leaky, overcrowded raft that eventually sank,
killing everyone but you. History is filled with
many people who risked their lives escaping to
another country because, had they stayed, they
would have been imprisoned or killed.

That's not what happened in the case of your
mother. Her life was not in jeopardy. Her son --
you -- was in no danger. The worst that could be
said is that, in Cuba, you were in jeopardy of
receiving free health care whenever you needed
it, an excellent education in one of the few
countries that has 100% literacy, and a better
chance of your baby sister being born and
making it to her first birthday than if she had
been born in Washington, DC.

The truth is your mother and her boyfriend
snatched you and put you on that death boat
because they simply wanted to make more
money. I can understand why they wanted a
better life. Cuba is a poor country. America,
from 90 miles away, looks like a rich country.
The majority of people who have sailed to this
country in the past have come for the same
reason. Often, they have come because they
did not like living in a country, such as Cuba,
where you cannot freely elect your president and
your basic rights are limited. I can understand
that.

But your mother placed you in a situation where
you were certain to die on the open seas (as the
rest did) and that is unconscionable. It was the
ultimate form of child abuse, and I see now why
the Cuban judge did not give your mother
custody.

Now you are with "relatives" in Miami. Normally,
in this country, when we say, "I'm going to stay
with the relatives," we mean brothers, sisters,
aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents.

You are with a "great-uncle" and a "second
cousin." It's not that they aren't blood-related,
but, let's face it, in our country they and the
third cousins-once removed are usually not
sitting at the Thanksgiving table and are only
rarely heard from usually when they need bail
money or part of the inheritance. But in our
country, no "relative" replaces the parent. A
brother, cousin or "great-uncle" who holds a
child against the will of the parent is committing
a major crime.

You must really miss your daddy! I hear he's
coming soon. Those "relatives" are trying to
prevent him from being with you. I know, that
doesn't feel like love, does it? Please don't take
it personally. They do love you. They love
having you to toss around in front of the TV
cameras so they can further their own political
agenda.

You are only six, so I know you can't
understand what all of the politics are about.
That's okay. Some day, you will. In time, you'll
read how these former Cubans, who are abusing
you, instead of staying in Cuba and fighting for
freedom like our ancestors did for this country in
1776, they turned tail and ran to Miami. Once
here, they began demanding that we Americans
fight their fight for them.

What did we do?

Something stupid! We fought their fight for
them! We based our entire foreign policy in this
hemisphere on one thing -- eliminating Castro.
We tried to assassinate him. We sent "troops"
to invade at the Bay of Pigs. We prevented
medicine and food from being shipped to Cuba.
When I was nearly your age, we almost blew up
the world over Cuba and Castro. Can you
believe that? We had become as insane as
those ex-Cubans in Miami!

And we've stayed that way for forty years. We're
still wacked-out over Cuba. Last year, we fined
an American citizen $10,000 because he went
down to Cuba to tune pianos! It's illegal in this
"free" country to travel there. Loopy, huh?
We've been driven crazy 'cause that we still can't
get rid of Fidel Castro. He's out-lived nine of our
presidents!

We have allowed these ex-Cubans with the
yellow stripe down their backs to operate
numerous terrorist missions from South Florida.
These same ex-Cubans were the ones who
broke into a place called Watergate (that
eventually brought down a president), ran drugs
for arms operations (that brought down a
popularly-elected government in Nicaragua),
and, according to some Americans, were behind
the assassination of our president, John
Kennedy (that puts us on a slippery slope we're
still sliding down).

Now, these very ex-Cubans who were afraid to
stand and fight Castro have suddenly found the
courage to fight...us! That's right, they have
made it clear that they will fight, with violence,
any federal officers or troops who are sent in to
enforce our laws (those outrageous ones which
say a son should be with his father).

And you are caught in the middle of all this. I
am so sorry. I wish there was something I could
personally do. I will write to our Attorney General
(web@...) and tell her to stop this child
abuse. I will encourage others to do the same. I
wish I could convince our vice-president (who's
running for president) to help, but he too has
decided to abuse you by using you for his own
political gain. The governor of the state you're
in, Jeb Bush, is the brother of a man running for
president. He wants to use/abuse you, too. I
just want you to know that 80% of the country
doesn't like either of these men.

I guess that's the silver lining in your little
cloud. The majority of Americans are sickened
by the way you are being treated. Please
understand that bad things are often done in
our name and with our money. Often, there is
little we can do as the choices on our ballots are
nearly as slim as the choices your father has on
his.

It's not easy being six -- anywhere in the world.
I know this all too well. My country, the one your
mother thought you should be living in, allows
its six-year olds access to guns, and a little
six-year old girl in my hometown was killed last
month by another six-year old. This is the world
we adults have created for you. This is the world
I promise to do my best, in my own small way,
to change.

I pray you'll be playing catch soon with your
wonderful, loving daddy on a Cuban baseball
diamond. By the time you're 18, long after
Castro and the Bushes and all this nonsense is
gone, maybe you can come back to America on
your own free will.

The Tigers, I can assure you, will still be in
desperate need of some good pitching.

Yours,
Michael Moore

Date: 	4/7/00 3:02AM
Subject: 	[criticalmassnb] Mile Run Contamination 

Dear All:
   The Edison Wetlands Association (EWA) recently tested the soil and water of the Mile Run, a brook that serves as a border between New Brunswick and Franklin Twp., and came up with some disturbing results.  Lead, mercury, chamfer,volatile and semi-volatile chemicals were found in the samples taken where the brook intersects Hamilton St.  The likely culprit of this contamination is the Rhodia chemical facility on Jersey Ave. in New Brunswick.  Rhodia has been under a consent order to clean up its site since 1987, but has moved at what EWA considers a glacial pace. EWA has filed suit against Rhodia for its foot dragging.  Testing at the site has revealed the above contaminants plus arsenic and two types of PCBs.  (Actually, I'll be meeting with EWA next week where I'll get the complete list of contaminants at the site and down stream)
   The Mile Run winds its way through working class neighborhoods through New Brunswick and Franklin and emptys out into the Raritan River near the Landing Lane Bridge.  In the past, and possibly now, children have played in it and along its banks.  Clearly, the contamination poses a threat to the river ecology and residents of both communities.
  EWA, the Work Environment Council, and the Raritan Valley Greens have agreed to form a coalition to restore and protect the Mile Run Brook.  We invite all concerned residents to join us in this fight.  It is not necessary to become a member of these groups , we just ask you to work with us.  Please contact me if you're interested.  

Sincerely:
Mark Grieco

Just a reminder that *tonight* at 7 PM at the Demarest Hall Lounge on the
College Avenue Campus at Rutgers...is the CHOICE ROCKS! concert. 

Featuring: AUS ROTTEN from Pittsburgh, PA and THE HAGGARD of Portland, OR

with

DIVERSITY, SLOW CHILDREN, CATHERINE MOON, PAM NOVICK, JANHAVI PAKRASHI and
MERE OURS! 

There will be tabling, and speaking--if you want to represent your
organization, let us know! 

All proceeds will go to clinic defense (the South Jersey Clinic Defense
Coalition)! 

Suggested donation is $5....get there early, or you might miss something! 

THEN...

Tomorrow, Saturday, April 8, protest NJ Right to Life at the Doubletree
Hotel in Somerset! 

NJRtL was expelled from National Right to Life for *refusing* to sign a
non-violence pledge. They have featured prominent right-wingers in the
past, including this year's guest, Joseph Sobran, who wants to ban
marriage between people of different races and who calls himself
"anti-semitic". Fight for choice! 

See you tonight at 7, tomorrow at 8! 

Charlotte

CHOICE ROCKS! concert sponsored by LABIA and BiGLARU

Subject:PEOPLE'S CONVENTION
Message:

A message from the Steering Committee:

Sisters & brothers,

The historic first New Brunswick People's Convention on 
May 13 (10AM to 6PM at Paul Robeson School) is rapidly 
approaching. We have less than a month left to mobilize 
the community to take an active part in the decisive 
event that will lead the people's democratic 
reconstruction of the city. We have worked hard to reach 
out to the people (thousands of flyers posted, over five 
thousand newspapers distributed and over five hundred 
surveys completed so far). It is now essential that we 
CONSOLIDATE our effort and do all that we can to turn 
out the more conscious workers, students and middle-
class residents at the Convention. Everyone in the 
campaign should draw up a LIST OF TEN RESIDENTS THAT YOU 
KNOW who you will CALL, MEET WITH AND PICK UP (if 
necessary) ON THE DAY OF THE CONVENTION. This is the 
best way to guarantee that we pack the house and truly 
represent the will of the various communities that must 
unite if the people are to win in November. We must 
especially focus on turning out the people we met during 
the canvass who are enthusiastic about the campaign. (If 
you haven't been out to canvass yet, come meet us at the 
Library on Saturday (12:45PM) or Sunday (11:45AM) and 
get down to the grass roots!) Everyone in the campaign 
should bring their list of ten names with them for the 
General Meeting on April 29th. If you can't come up with 
ten names off the top of your head, don't worry. The 
Outreach Committee has gathered many, many names of 
residents who want to seize power in New Brunswick. 
Let's all mobilize for this most important turn out.

In unity, 

X.

Message:


Esteemed Readers--

As of last night, the Research/Right to Know Committee has instructed
me to perform the following work act in time for the School Board
elections of April 18th (Tuesday). (All but New Brunswick of
course.) Please review this proposed and **personal** media message
and have commentary "e-marked" by 10am, April 18th. Thanks, and
comment or ask any questions you may have.

Solidarity,

Brian Villa



***PROPOSED MESSAGE***

Dear Editor: 

  In towns throughout New Jersey this past Tuesday, people's
democracy was expressed through electoral action in the form
of school board elections. Yet in the City of New Brunswick,
an example of our colonial democracy, the people have no vote.

  Why should the people have no vote on the education and future
of our community's children? Why, in New Brunswick should the
people have "taxation without representation" in a school government
which has a spending budget larger than City hall, and one-third
of the Middlesex County government tax base?

  Even when the public asks questions that seek the affirmation
of democratic accountability, we are met with the authoritarian
arrogance of public officeholders who scold those who ask questions
of public interest.

  This was the recent case with city council member Robert Recine
and citizen activist Frank Bright, when this public representative
asked why elected councilman Recine voted against the school
budget as a member of the Board of School estimate but then switched
votes as a council member which increased the property tax rate.

  More galling is that the councilman wanted to conduct this
public business in hushed private conversation. Could it be that
Recine does not want this embarassing issue to be reseen when
he attempts reelection in November?

  In addition to the city council's school and property tax increase,
we need to seriously look at our unelected school board. Three
of seven members have significant conflict-of-interest concerns.
Two, Martin Arocho and Edwin Gutierrez, have court charges pending
against them for voting for a $415,583 contract to an organization
to which they have historical ties. The third school board member,
Ed Spencer, like Gutierres, works for the City of New Brunswick
--and of course the mayor which appointed him.

  Yet despite all this and the fact that better spending and
budget actions worth several million dollars could be begun in
the school system but are not, the people who comprise the public
do not have an elected say in the children, do not have an elected
say in their schools, and do not have a say in their school property
taxes.

  In too many ways, the electoral system in New Brunswick resembles
that of  colonial democracy where in order to have a true political
voice one has to be White and own a certain level of real property.
In short, this is democracy for the few.

  New Brunswick must have a demorcracy which is current with
the New Millenium and popular democratic expressions throughout
the world --most notably the washington D.C. protests against
World Bank and International Monetary Fund policies. 

  The people --the many-- must act upon their democratic rights
and seize the power that rightfully belongs to then as citizens
in the land of the free and the home of the brave. When the people
lead, the leaders will be made to  follow.

Brian Villa
New Brunswick, NJ

Brian,
Well written and convincing, but I fail to understand who you are 
addressing...  do you mean this is a letter to the editor in a newspaper, 
and if so, wouldn't you need to have it to the papers before tomorrow so you 
can get it published in time for the elections, or are you trying to get it 
published after the elections take place???

Message:

Anybody catch the Monday Star Ledger Article about Dem Congressional 
candidate Jon Corzine, who's opposing FlimFlamFlorio in June 
primaries...Quote: "It is my view that a time of unprecedented prosperity os 
not an excuse for complaceny, but a time to seize the moment, to take up the 
great unfinished business of social and economic justice."  Stuart 
Rothenberg compaired him to Lenora Fulani, formerly of the New Alliance 
Party (M-L, according to the SL).  His current platform supports abortion 
rights, extending marraige rights to gays, opposes welfare reform, supports 
affirmative action, opposes the death penalty, ties trade policy to labor 
and environmental issues, decries US foreign policy as Eurocentric, and 
claims the US should have intervened in Rawanda.  Also advocates universal 
health care and universal access to college as well as expansion of urban 
development.  He was just endorsed by 20 NJ black ministers, including
Rev. Reginald Jackson.

Granted, he's a multi-millionaire former CEO of Goldman Sachs with a 
questionable history, but it's certainly interesting that candidates are 
running to the left to become electable.  Perhaps the NB Peoples' Campaign 
should drop his campaign a note, and squeeze an endorsement. (We should also 
be considering getting endorsements from other statewide figures, such as 
Rev. Jackson, to broaden focus on the campaign.)

What does his running mean for democracy?

What will his endorsement mean in terms of support from the poor working and middle classes in New Brunswick.? I know Kathy Cupano is supportive of Florio because of the democracy issue - as to whether she is an appropriate litmus test, at least she certainly was a real challenger to the city machine, although I am ignorant of much of the history in local politics.

yes, i totally agree with matthew's suggestion that we start trying to 
establish some ties with other "left" candidates. I have been thinking about 
Maureen Connolly for example, mayor of Fanwood, who is currently running for 
Senate on a feminist, pro-working family platform (she has received NJ NOW's 
endorsement; spoke recently at TBTN, and has a series student following).

What do people think? i know that there's a lot of work as it is, but 
perhaps we shall soon see the need for a "legislative action committee"...

any comments?

Subject:RE: survey data entry and scientific soundness
Message:


I understand there is a large enough data pool to correlate some
public issues. However, I caution that the survey pool must represent
a large and diversified spatial dimension of New Brunswick. If
not, no pronouncements should be made about what the city's people
desire. This is the only way to insure that the survey is sound.

Subject:RE: Re: [nbpeoplescampaign] Corzine
Message:


Corzine will not endorse our effort. He is the puppet of county
democratic organizations. While ideationally progressive, we
will have a tough time seeing that translated in a conservative
U.S. Senate run by Mississppi Rebel Trent Lott. Even moreso given
the floor-level seniority he will have a a first-term member
of the Senate, if elected.

In terms of democracy and impact, I think it's pretty clear that
there are two classes of voters: those that vote, and those that
donate. Corzine comes from the latter. It's up to us to balance
the scales of power. Our impactful say is too limited too often.

though i don't think Corzine's endorsement will mean too much
in a real 
sense in terms of gaining the support of working people, it will
serve to 
further legitimize the Campaign and strengthen its position in
the 
mainstream eye. Though Corzine, by virtue of his former CEO status,
may not 
be a "champion" of the working class, it is unmistakable that
his 
progressive politics, for the time being, serve the interests

Subject:Endorsements
Message:

Now is the time to get our official endorsements and support for the convention. We have a lot of good press clips,  literature, and surveys completed to use for our advantage

The outreach committee will be going to churches and businesses next week to obtain their endorsements.  Media has put together a number of folders including 2 surveys, spanish flyer, newspaper and 2 press clips (HNT grassroots clip and Targum clip). Let us know if there should be something additional. Hopefully we can have letters, english and spanish for businesses and a general  letter ready by early next week signed by the steering committee and listing additional endorsers - so if you know of endorsing orgs, send all my way, even if you think they are obvious.  It would be great if we could get more endorsements before  the letters get made ie before Sun nite- If you want to go to someone to get an endorsement, let steering committee and Sam or me know, and we can get you a packet today, tomorrow, Sat.  If you have time next Thu we are going out to businesses in the evening.

Zofia

Good point.

Unfortunately, although Zofia and I orginally laid out the surveys to 
include: ward, district, nationality, race, age etc of people filling them 
out. Others took it upon themselves to change it, and now we are left with 
just a general overview of issues based on the canvass, which has been 
fairly expansive throughout new brunswick. At any rate, when made public, we 
will be clear in saying it is representative of the sample of the population 
that we surveyed.

Subject:Re: [nbpeoplescampaign] Corzine
Message:

It is probably true that Corzine won't publicly endorse us. It is also true that he is
a rich bourgeois politician whose allegiance to the working class and democartic
middle class should not be trsted.  However, he is appealing to basicly the same
constituency as us.  But he has much more influence, primarily due to his wealth and
acess to media.  The point of working with his camapign would be to gain access to our
people in many ways that we are currently unable to do. We should ride on his back not
the other way around.
I don't think that it is appropriate for the campaign to endorse Corzine at this time,
though I think that discussing it is worthwhile.  Our unity is based on our common
enemy in New Brunswick, this unity may or may not be compatible with Corzine.

A Victory for the Holiday Inn Workers, Thanks to You
(Now Let's Run a Ficus for Congress!)

April 26, 2000

Dear Friends,

We won!

Not only has Elian Gonzales been reunited with his
father (my only criticism of the raid and that photo
on Saturday is that the gun wasn't big enough), but
our Mexican friends in Minneapolis who were being
deported for starting a union have won their fight to
stay in the United States!

At the INS hearing yesterday, after being deluged
with thousands of your letters, plus the hard work
of a lot of good people in the Twin Cities, the
immigration judge ruled in favor of the 8 Mexican
housekeepers, declaring that they should be made
"legal."

You have no idea how stunning this decision is.
Last week, after interviewing the people at the INS
in Minneapolis, it was clear that these immigrants
(who were being punished because they
successfully formed a union at the Holiday Inn
where they worked) were going to lose. That is why
I wrote to ask you to flood the INS and the Justice
Department with e-mail. But within 24 hours of my
letter to you, those two federal agencies became
quite busy with the nuttiness in Miami. I figured that
our letters to them would get lost in all the
distraction.

But they didn't. By yesterday, the INS had received
tens of thousands of e-mails, eloquent pleas from
those of you who asked that these 8 Mexican
workers be given the same chance most of our
ancestors got when they came to America.

Well, it worked. I can't thank you enough for taking a
few minutes to lend a hand. I continue to be
amazed at the power of the Internet. A few years
ago, we never would have been able to respond so
quickly to a problem, let alone even hear about it.
We must try to keep the Internet in the hands of the
people and free of government and corporate
control. This is a powerful tool.

The Mexicans have received what is called
"deferred status," meaning they can stay and work
legally until such time they can be upgraded to
perhaps a green card or even citizenship. This is a
huge victory. Thanks again to all of you plus the
lawyers and church people in Minneapolis who
gave their time.

You can see the whole story -- plus how we
punished Holiday Inn in our own "special way" -- on
an upcoming episode of "The Awful Truth" (which
premieres in three weeks on Wednesday, May 17,
10pm ET/PT on Bravo).

And, speaking of "The Awful Truth," we are holding
a press conference in an hour to formally
announce a "candidate" we are running for
Congress -- a Ficus plant. That's right. We are
running a potted plant for the U.S. House of
Representatives. Since word leaked out about us
trying to get a Ficus on the ballot, over 20 other
people around the country have also announced
campaigns to get Ficuses elected in their districts.

If you would like to get on board the potted plant
bandwagon and run a write-in campaign in your
district, please read the press release below. We
are shooting all this for "The Awful Truth," and it is
our hope to see Ficuses and other houseplants
giving incumbent Congressmen who face little or
no opposition a run for their money. 95% of all
incumbents get re-elected and many of them run
unopposed. We believe the country would be better
off with a Ficus tree sitting in Congress than some
of these clowns. So, check out our website
(http://www.Ficus2000.com) and send us a photo
or video of the houseplant you are running for
Congress and we'll put it on our show.

Thanks again for your help!

Yours,

Michael Moore

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 26, 2000

FICUS PLANT ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY FOR
CONGRESS

NEW JERSEY'S 11TH DISTRICT IS TARGETED

PUBLIC ENCOURAGED TO WRITE-IN "FICUS" ON
BALLOTS

OVER TWENTY CONGRESSIONAL SEATS IN U.S.
CHALLENGED BY HOUSEPLANTS

Claiming that the American people "deserve
better," a potted plant, commonly known as "Ficus,"
formally announced its campaign this morning to
seek the Congressional seat in New Jersey's 11th
District as a write-in candidate on both the
Democrat and Republican Party ballots in the June
6 primary.

"The United States Congress is full of babbling
idiots and bumbling morons," said Ficus
campaign strategist and filmmaker Michael Moore.
"Most run unopposed in their primaries and 95%
are re-elected every time in the general election.
What we get from these Congressmen-for-life is a
lot of hot air, a bunch of promises that are never
kept, problems like health care and education that
are never addressed, more taxes for a bigger
military when there are no wars, and a bigger
paycheck for Congress when they don't deserve it."

Moore, in presenting the Ficus at a press
conference in the historic town square of
Morristown, New Jersey (site of George
Washington's military headquarters), also
announced that Ficuses in more than twenty other
Congressional districts around the country (see
list), where the incumbent faces little or no
opposition, are also entering the race.

"Ficus Fever is sweeping the nation," said Moore.
"In a country where the majority no longer vote,
writing in Ficus will give the disenfranchised voter a
chance to cast a vote for "None of the Above!"

Ficus will run as both a Democrat and a
Republican because, according to Moore, "There is
little difference between the two so-called parties."

"Both the Democrat and Republican nominees for
President are for NAFTA, for the death penalty, for
increased military spending, against immediate
universal health care, against stringent gun control
that would ban handguns, and both looked like
pandering idiots regarding their exploitation of that
six-year old Cuban boy."

"But, more important, both parties are beholden to
those who pay for their campaigns. Why should the
wealthy have two parties doing their bidding, and
the other 90% of Americans have no real
representation?"

The Ficus will accept no campaign contributions.
All it needs is air, sunlight, and water.

"And a little fertilizer," which Moore said the Ficus
"should find plenty of in Washington."

Moore said that "all Ficuses running for Congress
across the country meet the Constitutional
qualifications: each Ficus is at least twenty-five
years old, each has been in the U.S. for at least
seven years, and each is a resident of the district
where it seeks election."

A search of the official Ficus website -
www.Ficus2000.com - confirms that at least
twenty-one potted plants are running as write-in
candidates in states such as California, Illinois,
Pennsylvania, and Alabama.

The Congressional seat in New Jersey's 11th
District, which covers Morris County and part of
Essex County - and is inhabited by the state's
highest income earners - is currently held by Rep.
Rodney Frelinghuysen, a three-term Republican,
and the thirteenth wealthiest member of Congress.
Frelinghuysen's father once held the same seat
and, since 1793, New Jersey has sent six
Frelinghuysens to Congress -- four to the U.S.
Senate and two to the House of Representatives.

"We think it's time to point out to the Frelinghuysen
Family that we live in a democracy, not a dynasty. If
no credible human out of the district's 500,000
voters was willing to step forward and challenge
Mr. Frelinghuysen, at least the voters now have a
houseplant to give them a real choice on June 6."

Moore said the Ficus will run under the slogans:
"FICUS: Because We Deserve Better"
and
"Put a Houseplant in the House - Vote Ficus."

Anyone around the country who would like to
challenge their incumbent Congressman with a
potted plant is encouraged to contact Moore on the
www.Ficus2000.com web site.

"The choice is simple - hot air or oxygen? I've seen
a lot of politicians lie, cheat, steal, and use
improper syntax. I have never met one who can
perform photosynthesis."

Which convention flyer is X taking care of?  There is already a Spanish 
convention flyer in existence.  It will be copied by Keith by this weekend.

If outreach would like a press conference, might I suggest you talk to me 
about it quickly.  Press conferences tend to get pretty shotty unless you 
have AT LEAST a week to prepare.  Please let me know what your plans are.

Keep an eye out for the Media Minutes.

>Journalists strike to battle censorship at Pacifica Radio
>
>On January 31, 2000, Pacifica Radio's top free-lance reporters and
>contributors, backed by several nationally-recognized, free-speech
>organizations, struck Pacifica's national-news program to protest on-going
>censorship at the 50-year-old community-radio network.
>
>"We believe Pacifica management seeks to intimidate and censor those who 
>try
>to report on matters that management prefers to keep quiet," said PNN
>contributor Aaron Glantz from his base in Berkeley. "Management has not 
>only
>failed to stop censoring the news, management has not even bothered to
>contact us to respond to our concerns. So we have no choice but to strike,"
>Glantz added.
>
>Dozens of journalists from across the Americas, Europe and Asia, many of
>whom have won the industry's top awards, will strike for the next three
>months unless Mary Frances Berry, who chairs both the U.S. Civil Rights
>Commission and the Pacifica Foundation, publicly renounces censorship
>throughout the network, and reasserts the editorial independence of
>Pacifica's local and national-news divisions. The striking journalists
>comprise a majority of active contributors and reporters to Pacifica 
>Network
>News, PNN, a daily, half-hour news program that airs on some 70 radio
>stations nationally. In a recent two-month period, nearly 70% of Pacifica's
>stories came from its stringers.
>
>The striking reporters delivered a signed letter one week ago outlining
>their demands to Pacifica's entire national board, including chair Mary
>Frances Berry, via certified mail, fax and e-mail. To date, there has been
>no official response from Pacifica. Several attempts by the reporters to
>reach Pacifica management--which has not released its phone number to the
>public--have been unsuccessful.
>
>Since the letter was delivered to management last Monday, additional
>stringers have joined the action, and several affiliates are considering a
>boycott of Pacifica Network News as an act of solidarity with the striking
>reporters.
>The strike is supported by the media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy 
>in
>Reporting, Project Censored and the National Association for Freedom of
>Expression. "The survival of PNN as a reliable source of information is 
>very
>much in doubt," said syndicated media critic Norman Solomon, "this strike
>may be the last chance to make PNN something trustworthy."
>
>Pacifica has long been a bastion of free speech--from broadcasting Allen
>Ginsberg's "Howl," to defying the HUAC witch hunts, to airing the
>commentaries of death-row journalist Mumia Abu Jamal. Since the crisis last
>spring, when armed guards were called in to lock out staff at KPFA, 
>Pacifica
>reporters say management has subjected journalists, contributors and
>independent producers to repeated acts of alteration, suppression and
>censorship of news stories and public-affairs programming, which they say
>are of vital interest to the listeners of Pacifica and the broader
>communities it serves. Reporters also note that management has repeatedly
>silenced programs in mid-broadcast, and ousted signature voices such as 
>Polk
>award-winner Larry Bensky.
>
>In November, Pacifica Network News director Dan Coughlin was "removed" 
>after
>airing a story on a boycott by sixteen Pacifica affiliates over the issue 
>of
>censorship. Most recently, veteran news anchor Verna Avery-Brown, the only
>African-American national-news anchor in public broadcasting, resigned
>amidst the crisis at PNN. Brown cited, among other concerns, censorship and
>a disturbing trend away from progressive coverage in Pacifica's national
>news. The strikers are also demanding that Coughlin be reinstated.
>
>The type of direct censorship of news personnel and programming which

>From: eastcoastnet@...
>
>Hundreds of police will descend on Florham Park

>International Monetary Fund meeting, in hopes
>of averting the kind of mayhem that erupted in
>Seattle last December.
>
>Demonstrators from national unions to local civic

>
>Agents from the Secret Service and FBI have held
>tactical sessions with officials from the Morris County
>sheriff's and prosecutor's offices, as well as the New Jersey
>State Police and borough police. At least one more
>meeting is scheduled for today, officials said.
>
>"We're hoping people do not come to protest," Florham
>Park Mayor Barbara B. Doyle said yesterday. "We're
>encouraging people not to, but we recognize their
>right to free speech, so we will be prepared."
>
>Morris County officials did not know why Florham
>Park was chosen as the site of the meeting.
>
>The rally at the Hamilton Park Conference Center,
>advertised on several groups' Internet sites and
>through mass e-mailings, is intended to highlight
>what activists contend are poor economic
>policies imposed by the World Bank on developing
>countries.
>
>The protest is a prelude to a larger demonstration
>known as the "Festival of Resistance" set for April 16 and
>17 in Washington, D.C., organizers said.
>
>"One of the main things we want to see is debt
>cancellations for all the poor, third-world countries," said
>Carol Gay, chairwoman of New Jersey Jobs with Justice
>and a Communications Workers of America union member.
>
>The protest in Morris County comes about four months
>after tens of thousands of demonstrators converged on
>Seattle for the World Trade Organization's ministers
>meeting, which saw vandalism and violent clashes
>between police and pickets.
>
>Authorities here have not made such detailed preparations
>since last June, when a 12-hour "rave" concert was
>scheduled - and highly publicized on the Internet - at
>the Mennen Sports Arena in Morris Township. The result
>was the arrest of 80 young people and a police overtime
>bill of about $46,000 still not recovered from the promoter.
>
>Sheriff Edward V. Rochford yesterday said all 225 employees
>in his department will be on duty for the protest.
>
>Also, all 39 Morris municipalities have been told they may
>be needed to respond in case of an emergency. It is the
>first time the Morris County Regional Emergency
>Deployment System (MCREDS) has been initiated.
>
>"We're hoping for the best but preparing for the worst,"
>Rochford said. "Our policy is for restraint. We're going to
>let the protesters do whatever they want that is legal."
>
>Protest organizers - which also include the New Jersey
>Industrial Union Council, AFL-CIO and the Bergen Action
>Network - said they are planning a nonviolent display that
>will include a teach-in and large rally.
>
>"One of the legacies of Seattle is it kind of woke people up
>to their concerns of economic globalization," said
>Jim Burchell, director of Morristown-based Peace Works.
>"But one of the downsides was the violence, which was
>only a small part of what went on."
>
>The World Bank's invitation-only meeting will include speeches
>by its president, James Wolfenson, and IMF Acting Managing
>Director Stanley Fisher.
>
>"We have problems in that they're not open to the public
>and that they're not open to democracy," said Bennet D.
>Zurofsky, a Newark attorney representing the rally
>coalition free of charge.
>
>"I am quite certain there are a number of people willing
>to be arrested because of civil disobedience," he said. "I
>could see someone, for example, going up to the
>conference door and asking to present a position."
>
>Officials are ready to make arrests, if necessary. The old
>county jail is overcrowded, so authorities are prepared to
>prematurely open the new jail in Morris Township, which
>is still officially under construction.
>
>"If there is an unusual number of arrests, we'll have a
>number of Superior Court judges on call, and we'll make
>sure people get a prompt hearing wherever they are,"
>Superior Court Assignment Judge Reginald Stanton
>said yesterday.
>
>Planning continues this week for the rally, but Burchell
>said appearances by several speakers, a rap poet, the Peace
>Punk Band and the Solidarity Singers, who perform
>old union songs, are confirmed.
>
>"The unknown is what will be the turnout," said Morris County
>Prosecutor John B. Dangler.
>
>"There might be 50 people or 5,000, so we'll just be prepared
>for either case. These are not terrorists, just people with different
>opinions."
>
>Zurofsky said the demonstrators he has spoken with vowed
>to adhere to four rules at the protest: no use of alcohol or
>drugs, no weapons, no destruction of property and no use
>of physical or verbal force.
>
>"We don't believe we are trying to do anything but engage
>in peaceful and lawful demonstration," he said.
>
>Zurofsky alerted Florham Park police, Hamilton Park officials
>and the provost at Fairleigh Dickinson University, which abuts

>Burchell said organizers would supply that equipment,

Subject:road widening
Message:

I went to the DOT road widening meeting.  They are going to make Rt 18 a 2 lane express and 2 lane local service each way from Rte 1 to the Albany Street bridge, with the express and local lanes clearly separated from eachother, to address the accidents that have occurred, and they also have taken into account projected growth in car traffic.  This was inot coordinated with the NJ transit people - the NJ Transit basically did a service study and determined that there was not enough demand to increase service.  Of course, they didnt estimate that based on what demand would be like if the service treated people like human beigns instead of leaving them stranded at night along the highway next to a measly metal post.  

Anyway as to changeable details - looks like there will be very little noise buffering.  Also the bike paths - to be on both sides of the road, although in many places the southbound paths curve around corners at crosstreets for a block only to serpentine back again onto the main road.  The guy I talked to recognized that people will take shortcuts and just walk across the crosstreet and I said you have to build it according to the shortcuts people will take to make it safer. 

Anyway if anyone wants a copy of the plan and the comment sheet to send in let me know.

This is for anyone who has a computer: this is the latest version of the 
foremost anti-virus software out there. McAfee is used by every major 
corporation to protect their systems. And remember, don't open any emails 
with the subject saying 'I Love You', it's a nasty virus that's crashed much 
corporate email. And don't register this software, either, or I may be 
exposed to much legal liability. Cheers, Paul

Subject:ILOVEYOU Virus Fix I put together
Message:

Here's what you can do to fix your PC:

LOVE VIRUS FIX

1.      A. In Windows 95/98, hit CTRL+ALT+DEL and see if you have a WSCRIPT 
file running in memory.  If so, highlight it and click END TASK.
B.      If NT Server/Workstation, hit CTRL+ALT+DEL and select Task 
List.  From the Processes Tab, if you find Wscript.exe, click it and click 
End task.
C.      NOTE: If this file is not resident in memory then you can stop 
searching on this machine only, the network or other PC's may be affected.
2.      Open Internet Explorer, Click Tools, click Internet Options and 
edit the Home Page Box to your normal Home Page (i.e. www.altavista.com) on 
the General Tab
3.      Next, click START, then RUN and type regedit in the Run Box and hit 
ENTER.  This will bring up the registry editor.
4.      Once in, double-click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
5.      Double-click SOFTWARE
6.      Double-click MICROSOFT
7.      Double-click WINDOWS
8.      Double-click CURRENT VERSION
9.      Click RUN, find MSKernel32, right-click and select Delete
10.     Click RUNSERVICES, find Win32DLL, right-click and select Delete
11.     Now, you need to do a search on each PC and the network 
drive(s).  Login to your machine as Administrator or Admin 
equivalent.  Click START, click FIND then click FILES (OR FOLDERS).
12.     In the Named box, enter .vbs and click FIND NOW.
13.     It will search out files that end with .VBS.  You can delete any 
VBS file that is 11K in size with today's date.  If it was a .JPG file, 
then the file is completely overwritten with the virus.  If it was a .MP3 
or .MP2 file, then it made the original file a hidden file and called the 
new copy ".MP3.VBS."  The .VBS file can be deleted and the original should 
be made NOT HIDDEN by right clicking on the file, selecting Properties and 
uncheck the "Hidden" box.
14.     It also affects vbe, js, jse, css, wsh, sct, hta and jpeg in a 
similar fashion.  Again, if a .VBS file is 11K with today's date, YOU MUST 
DELETE IT BUT MAKE SURE YOU NOTE THE FILE NAME SO YOU CAN RECOVER IT FROM 
YESTERDAY'S BACKUP.

Subject:Newark-NJ-Store Kiosk to be displayed at UniverSoul Circus
Message:


Newark-NJ-Store Kiosk to be displayed at UniverSoul Circus in Newark, May 
10-14

The Outreach Committee of the Lincoln Park-Coast Cultural District, Inc.,
presents the Newark-NJ-Stores Kiosk as a first step towards The Newark 
Endowment for the Arts


A component part of the overall renewal effort for the Lincoln Park-Coast 
Cultural District, the Newark-NJ-Store kiosk will be displayed at the 
UniverSoul Circus--the only Afro-American owned and operated circus in the 
world--during its visit to Newark from May 10-14.

The Newark-NJ-Store kiosk is a concept project whose goal is to amass and 
duplicate all products of Newark's (and NJ &c) native achievers.   For 
example, Books, Records, Memorabilia, Photos, Testimonials, will be 
commercially replicated and reproduced as stock for the store. So that a 
Newark-NJ-Store would be a Newark historical-cultural archive and 
tourist/institutional/scholarly resource, able to sell these products 
directly or by mail order to the many thousands of potential customers who 
would be interested.

Just to list a few of the potential contributors to this huge resource: 
Willie "The Lion" Smith, Sarah Vaughan, Jerry Lewis, Ed Koch, Allen 
Ginsberg, Sistah Soul Jah, Philip Roth, Stephen Crane, Whitney Houston. 
Melba Moore, Wayne Shorter, Eva Marie Saint, Joe Pesci, Savion Glover, 
Nathan Beard, Claude Brown, James Moody, &c &c.


A NEWARK ENDOWMENT FOR ART, CULTURE, HUMANITIES

The most profound aspect of the Newark-NJ-Store is that by getting 
agreements from the kind of contributors mentioned above, we can also get 
these important people to contribute the same kinds of materials and revenue 
and projections, of regular appearances for benefits, &c to become 
contributors to an OVERALL ARCHIVE which will be the Value Base for the 
establishment of an Endowment, which can not only serve as a basic revenue 
engine for the development of the Lincoln Park Coast Cultural District, but 
as the material foundation for the completely innovative creation of a 
municipal endowment for the Arts, Culture, Humanities in the city of Newark, 
independent of outside philanthropy, but at the same time Enhancing and 
giving prestigious embellishment for Grant Proposals that LPCCD or any arts, 
culture, humanities project generated throughout the city.

The Newark-NJ-Store Kiosk was initially unveiled to a limited audience at 
the Newark Symphony Hall for the LPCCD Gala and Dance February 25, 2000.  
Here the concept received enthusiastic support from many in Newark's 
cultural, political, and business communities.  It has since been on display 
at the NJ School of Architecture at NJIT for a conference recently held 
there by LPCCD.  The installation at the UniverSoul Circus will be the first 
time the Newark-NJ-Store Kiosk will be opened up to a wider public audience 
in Newark.

Subject:Cafes, Starbucks, Redevelopment issues: Right to know?
Message:

I was talking to a friend last night about the Campaign, and we started
talking about redevelopment issues, corporatization, and big business vs.
small business in NB. It turns out that a little over a year ago, he had
set out to open a cafe in the city, on Elm Street. Considering that 4-5
cafes had closed in the city in the last few years (but had generally been
popular), he saw a market as an individual businessperson for an
alternative to Starbucks. 

However, he met *serious* delays when attempting to wend his way through
city bureaucracy. Zoning applications and questions which should have
taken weeks to answer instead took months, or were never answered at all,
as when he asked about the likelihood of demolition on Elm Street for
DevCo-sponsored redevelopment projects. He met with so many delays and so
much resistance from city officials that after over a year of attempting
to make it work, he gave up the project. 

He connected this to Starbucks' influence with the city. Apparently, a few
years ago, the health food and vitamin store in Kilmer Square, Back to
Nature, was located at the George/Albany corner. A chain store came in and
bought out the store, which they kept open, but moved several doors down
in Kilmer Square. At the time, it was apparently heavily suspected that
the city was encouraging the buyout of Back to Nature (against the
original wishes of the store owner) in order to ensure the freeing-up of
the valuable real estate at George and Albany. Starbucks soon moved in,
and since then, 4-5 cafes have closed, and while attempting to ease
Starbucks' way in any way possible, city officials have repeatedly
hampered individuals attempting to open cafes and similar businesses
without the backing of a large corporation like Starbucks (which, in
addition, is a "brand" which labels its homes as cities of upper-class
prestige). 

My friend compared this to the persistent rumors of city involvement in
planting drugs at Indigo Jones, attempting to force Earthcore out of the
city, and attempting to force Quantum X Music out. While the city says it
wants investment, these examples seem to show it wants investment *only*
from the biggest of big corporations, and not from independent
residents...

Anyone know more about this?

Charlotte

The last two decades have seen an explosion in the number and value of state and local "business incentives" enacted in the name of economic development. Often, these subsidies are promoted as a way to alleviate poverty or reverse urban decline. 
However, many such programs have become so deregulated that their original targeting intentions have been subverted. Some very disturbing evidence is now emerging that instead of reducing poverty or discrimination, taxpayer money some call "corporate welfare" is actually subsidizing poverty and fueling racial inequality. 
While the evidence is disturbing, news from the organizing front lines is heartening. Armed with breakthrough disclosure data and a trickle of foundation support, a small but determined network of non-profit groups is aggressively rewriting the policy dialog about development. Coalescing with many diverse movements, these groups are winning dozens of accountability precedents. Their breakthroughs suggest that "back to basics" * raising workers* living standards * is winning the day. 
Development Subsidies: Mushrooming and Loose
It*s not possible to place a dollar figure on state and local spending for development, because very few states report development budgets that combine spending in both appropriations and the tax code. Even fewer have centralized records about local property tax abatements. 
But the spending trend is undeniably up. Twenty years ago, only 21 states granted corporate income-tax credits; today, 37 do. Then, only nine states granted tax credits for research and development; today, 36 allow them. Only 20 states provided low-interest, tax-exempt bond financing; today, 44 provide it. 
It*s not at all unusual now to find deals worth more than $100,000 per job; five of our "Terrible Ten Candy Store Deals of 1998" exceeded that price * including one at $8.8 million per job! 
If such spending benefitted needy workers, perhaps it could be justified. But many such programs have become so deregulated as to moot anti-poverty intentions. For example, Louisiana, Arkansas and Ohio now have a total of 2,360 enterprise zones. Turning an anti-blight program into a "gimme" cancels the original targeting intent. 
Other subsidies undermine public services critical to equal opportunity. For example, the Louisiana Coalition for Tax Justice found that the state*s industrial property tax exemptions for the 1980s cost schools $941 million. Louisiana has one of the nation*s lowest high school graduation rates. (Almost three-fourths of the projects created no new jobs!)
So the boom in development spending not only is poorly targeted but is extremely expensive. The bottom line: real wages for average working people have declined about 15% since the late 1970s, and the share of working poor has increased by 5%. How could so much be spent for such bad results? The answer: most development subsidies still lack basic safeguards, such as real targeting, wage floors, employer-paid health care or full-time work requirements.
Job Subsidies and Equal Opportunity
There is also a small but disturbing body of evidence that development subsidies are being used by employers with discriminatory employment practices or by industries that are moving good jobs away from people of color. 
For example, a 1984 analysis of industrial revenue bonds (IRBs * low-interest loans supported by tax-free bonds) by the Illinois Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found an adverse effect on workers and minority entrepreneurs. They examined 104 IRBs in the Chicago area. In fully one-fifth of the deals, either the recipient company or the bank that bought the bonds had recently violated the federal fair employment rules of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
The study also found that only three IRBs went to African Amer*ican-owned firms, one to an Asian-owned firm, and none to Hispanic-owned firms. At one-third of the companies, Black workers were far underrepresented compared to the area*s overall labor market. Two-thirds of the companies also had disproportionately small Hispanic employment, and more than half had disproportionately small female workforces. 
The auto industry presents a troubling multi-state story. Since the mid-1980s, there have been massive auto investments in the U.S. by foreign car makers, especially Japanese firms, building more than 300 plants. Virtually all received multiple state and local development subsidies. This new "auto belt" is concentrated in Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Indiana and Ohio, South Carolina and Alabama, far away from traditional metal-working cities such as Detroit and Cleveland with large minority workforces. A 1988 study by University of Michigan professors Robert Cole and Donald Deskins on three early assembly "transplants" (Honda, Nissan and Mazda) and 51 Japanese parts plants or "subplants" found that African-American workers were significantly underrepresented at almost all of the 54 plants. 
A few transplants have been charged with discriminatory practices, such as defining recruitment territories that excluded urban areas with minority populations. Cole and Deskins found that Blacks comprised 2.8% of Honda*s Marysville, Ohio workforce, although they made up 10.5% of that area*s available workforce.
The Woodstock Institute examined the geographic distribution of Small Business Administration loan guarantees in the Chicago area. It found that higher-income and outlying zip codes received more loans than lower-income and closer-in areas. Several studies have found that incentives such as IRBs, intended to benefit distressed areas, are used more often by prosperous jurisdictions.
Sprawl: A New Analytical Wedge
Although urban sprawl is often viewed as a suburban quality of life issue driven by environmentalists, there is a social equity wing of the smart growth debate focusing on race [see john powell*s article in the Sept./Oct. 1999 P&R, "Achieving Racial Justice: What*s Sprawl Got to Do With It?"] That wing views the new "metropolitics" as a way for advocates of traditional equity causes such as community reinvestment, affordable housing and fair employment to frame their work as part of a regional solution. 
A new study by Good Jobs First links development subsidies to sprawl and concludes that taxpayer-financed corporate migrations are harming people of color in the Twin Cities. The study, "Another Way Sprawl Happens," analyzes 29 companies with 1,600 jobs that relocated to a 300-acre industrial park in the distant suburb of Anoka, which gave the companies free land valued at more than $7.5 million. 
The net result of the subsidized relocations was to move the jobs away from the region*s largest concentrations of people of color, away from pockets of poverty and away from households receiving public assistance. The migrations also had a devastating effect on transit accessibility. Before the relocations, more than 70% of the jobs were accessible by regularly scheduled transit. In the Anoka Park, they are no longer accessible. 
This movement will especially harm inner-city workers, who are more likely to rely on public transportation. Only 40% of Black households in the Twin Cities region owned a vehicle in 1990. A report on the region found that 50% of the region*s employment growth will occur in the outer-ring developing area where nearly half the projects are inaccessible by transit. Many studies have shown that decentralization of employment from central city to suburban locations has disproportionately harmed minority and low-income workers because they face barriers finding housing in the suburbs.
A few journalists have made the subsidy-sprawl link. A 1995 Kansas City Star series cited several prosperous suburbs giving tax breaks to companies leaving depressed core areas. The paper found the deals particularly galling because the tools being used by the wealthy suburbs were originally intended to help central cities. "Created to combat sprawl, tax breaks now subsidize it," the Star concluded. A 1999 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel series cited a mutual fund company in suburban Menomenee Falls which received a $3 million tax credit, justified because it is "close to Milwaukee County, which continues to have higher unemployment than the state average." A state senator commented: "[I]t*s essentially a government subsidy to promote sprawl."
Disclosure and Accountability: Hope on the Horizon
As mentioned above, a small but growing network of grassroots groups is working to rewrite the policy dialog about development. Building coalitions of organized labor, consumer, religious and civic groups, and living wage campaigns, these groups are literally redefining economic development.
The Minnesota Alliance for Progressive Action (MAPA) won the nation*s first comprehensive subsidy disclosure law in 1995. It requires annual, company-specific reports on job creation and wages. The data enabled Good Jobs First to analyze 525 deals and identify 38 deals valued at $100,000 or more per job. Despite such high subsidies, 65% of the subsidized companies were paying wages so low that a family of three would still qualify for Medicaid and 25% would still qualify for Food Stamps. Armed with these findings, MAPA won major reforms, including mandatory wage standards. 
The Maine Citizens Leadership Fund and the Maine Center for Economic Policy helped win disclosure in that state in 1997; the data are being analyzed by the Cambridge-based Commonwealth Institute. Among the key findings: 27% of the subsidized jobs pay wages below a living-wage benchmark tied to the federal poverty line, prompting a reform debate. 
The Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, the nation*s largest local subsidy-accountability project, analyzed that city*s biggest redevelopment deals of the 1990*s. It found that low-wage retail deals got 65% of the subsidies, and that 55% of those retail jobs paid less than $8 an hour, so little that a family of three would still qualify for public assistance.
Such pioneering efforts are moving the public debate. As Good Jobs First recently documented, at least 36 states, 26 cities and five counties now attach job quality standards such as wage rules, health care requirements and full-time hours to development subsidies * an eleven-fold increase since 1994!

Message:


Generally, this analysis seems to be on target. The city's Master
Development Plan (yes there is one and it's in print) calls for
the restructuring of the city economy along, government,university,
hospital health care, and entertainment economies. If you're
not in, you don't win --especially if you lack economic standing
to participate. this is generally how cities are reorienting
themselves in the face of corporate globalization as deindustrialization
surrounds us. Cities such as New Brunswick want economies that
cater to tourists, not vagabonds.

I think the Starbuck is a bit off the mark though. Back to the
Garden did want to move, as I understand it; it was too expensive.
The bigger rumor is that DevCo subsidized the franchise to the
tune of $50,000 initially, if not continuing ot this date. Clearly,
given the "big-ticket" nature of corporate entities being wooded
to town --along with the plan to import a "gent-tocracy" we see
where the city is supposedly heading. New Brunswick, with is
central location and transportation infrastructure, is seen as
a commuter town for New York workers. It is clearly distinct
from Red Bank, a good town for comparison.

Also, as for looking at the spatial and physical infractructure
of the town, consider this: if it's pre-World War II, it's a
good candidate for demolition, and demolition will take lace
along the city's main roads, for "improvement" in a Potemkin-like
fashion. 

Regarding books on this matter, see, Mike Davis' "City of Quartz"
and Paul Knox "Urbanization" (a text used at Rutgers).

I was talking to a friend last night about the Campaign, and
we started
talking about redevelopment issues, corporatization, and big
business vs.
small business in NB. It turns out that a little over a year
ago, he had
set out to open a cafe in the city, on Elm Street. Considering
that 4-5
cafes had closed in the city in the last few years (but had generally
been
popular), he saw a market as an individual businessperson for
an
alternative to Starbucks. 

However, he met *serious* delays when attempting to wend his
way through
city bureaucracy. Zoning applications and questions which should
have
taken weeks to answer instead took months, or were never answered
at all,
as when he asked about the likelihood of demolition on Elm Street
for
DevCo-sponsored redevelopment projects. He met with so many delays
and so
much resistance from city officials that after over a year of
attempting
to make it work, he gave up the project. 

He connected this to Starbucks' influence with the city. Apparently,
a few
years ago, the health food and vitamin store in Kilmer Square,
Back to
Nature, was located at the George/Albany corner. A chain store
came in and
bought out the store, which they kept open, but moved several
doors down
in Kilmer Square. At the time, it was apparently heavily suspected
that
the city was encouraging the buyout of Back to Nature (against
the
original wishes of the store owner) in order to ensure the freeing-up
of
the valuable real estate at George and Albany. Starbucks soon
moved in,
and since then, 4-5 cafes have closed, and while attempting to
ease
Starbucks' way in any way possible, city officials have repeatedly
hampered individuals attempting to open cafes and similar businesses
without the backing of a large corporation like Starbucks (which,
in
addition, is a "brand" which labels its homes as cities of upper-class
prestige). 

My friend compared this to the persistent rumors of city involvement
in
planting drugs at Indigo Jones, attempting to force Earthcore
out of the
city, and attempting to force Quantum X Music out. While the
city says it
wants investment, these examples seem to show it wants investment
*only*
from the biggest of big corporations, and not from independent
residents...

Anyone know more about this?

Charlotte

Message:

Chairperson:  Patricia Lambe
Board - 5 people, appointed by the mayor

Rent Contral Ordinance:

Allows for annual rent increases up to the level of Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (a Federal, not local metropolitan-based index) (2000 - 4.3%)
 
Other municipalities use a flat rate, say 3 or 4 % that may be .5% higher if heat is included in rent.

No application is necessary for annual permitted rent increase.

However, increases during vacancies require application and approval by the board, and landlords are subject to compliance with the inspection code  There is no limit on increases at that time.  In May 1989, vacancy decontral was eliminated.  It capped  those increases to 15%.

The landlord is also allowed to charge a hardship surcharge based on loss for a given year, and must show books.  There is a capital improvement surcharge permitted for added benefits to renters that is based on the beneficial life of an improvement, prorated over years.   Finally, there is an insurance surcharge that is rarely if ever used - if insurance exceeds 110% of prior years cost. These surcharges must be approved by the board.

I am curious as to why during the voting on the convention schedule at the
last general meeting, there was no vote called on the presence of Amiri
Baraka -- certainly no note of his being the "keynote speaker".  Since Amiri
Baraka is in Newark and represents a fringe movement, I suspect that the
general body would at least be interested in an open discussion of what his
role should be at the convention.  How did this get slipped in there?  Seems
like an important oversight to me.  Apparently, the steering committee took
its share of liberties with the topics presented to the general assembly.

Chris

P.S.  What is the "People's Campaign Movement?"  All this is very unclear to
me.  It almost sounds like Amiri Baraka is somehow involved at the very top,
but without a defined role and in a somewhat obscure manner.  The
implications become more and more interesting.

My concern is with the platform.  As a member of the right to know committee I took a look at the initial draft, and it will be posted in a more final form.  The elaborations on each point go into slightly more detail than our newspaper, but just enough to require more refinement than we have the capability for at this time.  As just one example, if we put forth a vote that the city should pay for more public bus service when in fact the county and state take care of most of the bus action, we will just look plain stupid.  The last thing we want to do is to bankrupt the city - lets get as much action from the feds, state, and county.  Ideally RTK would have had more time to at least review and investigate the sense of the platform points - then allow the debate to occur around direction of the platform without having to deal with lack of info clarity at the same time.  I am concerned that we are developing a platform that 1 is not informed adequately and 2. we will not have the time to have a real debate on it.  For many people, this will be thier first intro to the campaign, and I agree we dont want to torture people too much all at once.  Perhaps we should just stick addressing the major points at the convention, especially since there is no provision (because understandably there is no time) for a real debate.  One way to go would be to vote on the general provisions and take recommendations/input around each one, write it up on a board.  This would allow for a great participation process. Then set up committees on each point (RTK has been too strapped to address each one separately) to research it, look into the recommendations made at the convention, and  the entire next meeting could be spent on developing our platform basedon the recommendations of each committee.  Perhaps voting on the candidates, general tenets of the campaign and organization is enough for one day.

However, if we do this, we are not holding to the principle of the
convention as highest authority, it seems. The votes at the convention
become more or less suggestions for feasibility studies. Since the votes
at the convention, it seems, will be pretty general: eg "The People's
Campaign ticket will work to ensure that more publicly funded bus service
is provided to service all of the people of New Brunswick, encourage the
development of a truly extensive mass transit system and enable those
without cars to reach jobs and other destinations adequately", rather than
"The city will pay for more buses," this, IMO, won't be a major problem.
Certainly, after the convention, detailed positions on each point of the
platform must be developed. However, at the convention itself we should
proceed with the voting on program points with specific solutions at city
(and higher) levels where we are aware of the existence of such solutions. 

Right to Know is an essential committee of the campaign, which has done
excellent work so far, and I'm sure will be the source of much of those
position papers on platform planks. However, it doesn't have to clear
every program suggestion--and in fact, it can't, since additions and
deletions from the floor are open at the convention. In most general
political platforms of the kind we're discussing, there isn't a great deal
of specifics, except on certain key points, on how legislation or what
legislation is to be passed through what method, and how funding is to be
found--that's where position papers, etc. come in. The votes at the
convention for platform planks, it seems, will be quite general--there
won't be time for more--and after the convention, position papers can be
developed by all interested people to be voted on as accurate
representations of the campaign's platform at general meetings. This would
ensure the convention remains the highest authority of the convention,

The elaborations on each point go into slightly more detail than our newspaper, but just enough to require more refinement than we have the capability for at this time.  As just one example, if we put forth a vote that the city should pay for more public bus service when in fact the county and state take care of most of the bus action, we will just look plain stupid.  The last thing we want to do is to bankrupt the city - lets get as much action from the feds, state, and county.  Ideally RTK would have had more time to at least review and investigate the sense of the platform points - then allow the debate to occur around direction of the platform without having to deal with lack of info clarity at the same time.  I am concerned that we are developing a platform that 1 is not informed adequately and 2. we will not have the time to have a real debate on it.  For many people, this will be thier first intro to the campaign, and I agree we dont want to torture people too much all at once.  Perhaps we should just stick addressing the major points at the convention, especially since there is no provision (because understandably there is no time) for a real debate.  One way to go would be to vote on the general provisions and take recommendations/input around each one, write it up on a board.  This would allow for a great participation process. Then set up committees on each point (RTK has been too strapped to address each one separately) to research it, look into the recommendations made at the convention, and  the entire next meeting could be spent on developing our platform basedon the recommendations of each committee.  Perhaps voting on the candidates, general tenets of the campaign and organization is enough for one day.

Subject:About the Convention
Message:

Speaking for myself, not the Steering Committee, I want 
to make the following points:

1) I am glad to see the impassioned interest of all 
brothers and sisters in the People's Campaign. Struggle 
is a healthy sign of life for our movement. Our 
challenge is to carry out this struggle for the greater 
unity of the people of New Brunswick.

2)  The Steering Committee only found out last Monday 
(after the last General Meeting) that Amiri Baraka was 
available to speak at the Convention. We also invited 
significant New Brunswick opposition candidates of past 
elections such as James Neal, Dave Harris and Seth 
Grodofsky. We have not yet received a definite 
confirmation from any of them at this time. However, if 
any of them comes to the Convention and wishes to speak 
and endorse the People's Campaign, we should welcome 
them to do so. The Latino brothers whom we met on Sunday 
night (again, after the General Meeting) also asked to 
have a speaker at the Convention. 
 
3)  We invited Amiri Baraka because in 1968, 1970, and 
1972, he led a independent grassroots People's 
Convention movement in Newark that ACTUALLY WON the 
elections and defeated the corrupt and viciously racist 
political machine of Newark Mayor Addonizzio -a machine 
far more powerful than the one we face today in New 
Brunswick. The Newark People's Convention movement 
united revolutionary organizations, neighborhood groups, 
businesses and churches from the Afro-American and 
Puertoriqueno communities and grew to such national 
prominence that Stevie Wonder, Dustin Hoffman, Sun Ra 
and Bill Cosby among others came to Newark to campaign 
for it. The victory in Newark had such an impact 
nationwide that Amiri Baraka was asked to chair the 
National Black Assembly in Gary Indiana in 1972 with 
14,000 delegates from all across the country. If these 
concrete accomplishments, directly related to our 
campaign today, do not qualify him to speak in someone's 
view, they should raise opposition at the People's 
Convention and a vote can settle the issue. 

3)  Despite all its amateurish shortcomings (we are all 
new at this and our resources are still meager), the New 
Brunswick People's Campaign is without a doubt the most 
democratic people�s campaign in the entire country. No 
other movement seeks to unite such a broad array of 
people (and classes) in a difficult struggle for 
political power (not a mere protest) and holds monthly 
meetings where the entire campaign, including the 
leadership, can be changed by a majority vote. We 
elected a leadership because we cannot vote on every 
decision. We debated and voted on so many important 
points at the last General Meeting that we ran out of 
time to discuss even the rules of debate and voting 
procedures for the Convention, which, in my view, are of 
great significance. That is part of the reality of our 
struggle. With a professional, full-time staff and years 
of experience in electoral politics, we would (and I 
hope we will in the future) run a much more efficient 
campaign involving many, many more people from the very 
beginning at a much higher level of political 
consciousness. In the meantime, our critical task is to 
struggle for unity at the historic first New Brunswick 
People's Convention where many inspired residents will 
join in a political campaign for the very first time. 
And we must get clear about the challenge at hand: many 
people coming this Saturday are still unclear about what 
a City Council is!   

In unity, 

X.

Subject:Re: Important campaign issues, was : Amiri Baraka's speech
Message:

Charlotte, and everyone else,

Have you followed the discussion on the NJFO mailing list re: "who is the
working class?"  I feel it is a serious mistake, tactically and
ideologically, to exclude and alienate the middle class, both by putting
such fictitious and arbitrary labels as "petty bourgeoisie" on them and by
effectively ignoring them in organizing efforts.  As I discussed with Brian,
this poses several issues -- the establishment is certainly going to do
everything in their power to organize the middle class AGAINST the People's
Campaign.  If we have not, by then, done something to pre-empt this effort,
it will be remarkably easy to turn out the middle class voters against the
People's Campaign.  NJFO organizers complain that middle class people are
not receptive.  I have an entirely different experience.  I suspect that
they simply do not understand how to communicate with middle class folk.
The decision to expend very little effort to further this goal reflects a
failure of our leadership.

Furthermore, while Frank is on the campaign, and his valiant efforts to
conscript Republicans onto the People's Campaign are commendable, they have
been unwittingly thwarted by failing to account for the necessary
concessions of a united front.  The entire concept of a united front is to
organize around a common agenda that can be sold to all those you wish to
participate.  Thinly veiled -- or even explicit -- affronts against
political moderates are not uncommon on the Campaign mailing list, and the
idiotic discussion between Cliff and Xavier two meetings ago on the
viability of "seizing power without a revolution", among other examples of
childish role-playing of "revolutionary" roles served to alienate a good
portion of people who could have offered a significant contribution to the
campaign.  NJFO would do well to stop playing self-important faux guerillas
and acknowledge the fact that you are not revolutionaries or Red Army
officers, but activists.  While I'm sure some of you would love to see a red
flag flying over New Brunswick and secret police dutifully seeking out those
failing to adhere to 'the correct ideas', revolution is not going to happen
in New Brunswick.  The possibility for real social change is there, but you
have to let go of your pipe dreams and be a little more practical.  

You can scream "united front" until you turn purple, but until you start
acting like you want to unite people around a common platform, and STOP
pushing the "maximum program", at least for the next six months, the
establishment is going to use that as a very potent weapon to get people out
to vote AGAINST the campaign.  To use Brian's example, what do you think the
old Hungarian woman is going to do when the phone banks are in full
operation on election day, telling her to go out there and vote for the
Democrats because "Communists are trying to take over New Brunswick"?

I am sending this out to the list.  I feel it is important and I would like
to hear everyone's thoughts on the issue.

Subject:DRAFT PROGRAM
Message:

From the Steering Committee:

Here is the draft version of the political program which 
will be voted at the New Brunswick People's Convention. 
It has not yet been laid out in order of importance as 
determined by the surveys. 600 surveys have already been 
typed in, and the program should be ordered accordingly 
when it is distributed on Saturday. We will also need a 
final hustle to get all the literature translated in 
Spanish. If anyone can help, please e-mail me.

On Saturday, we will discuss and take amendments to the 
program before voting on it as a whole. I want to 
encourage everyone to see this most important document 
as the basis of a broad political unity of the people of 
New Brunswick. No program can satisfy all of everyone's 
wishes. We must struggle to improve and finalize the 
draft so that it is clearly grasped and supported by 
everyone at the Convention. This program, already 
disucssed and supported and by over one thousand 
residents, must inspire the great majority of the people 
of New Brunswick so that they will struggle for it and 
for the People's Campaign candidates to win in November.

In unity, 

X.

Subject:People's Convention this Saturday
Message:

Hello!

I am writing to let you know that this Saturday is the first Convention of 
the People's Campaign for New Brunswick City Council.  You are very welcome 
to attend. For those of you who may not know much about this historic event, 
I want to offer a brief background:

This November, 3 seats will open on the New Brunswick City Council. These 
seats constitute the majority of the Council, which consists of 5 seats 
total. In December 1999, NJFO (the New Jersey Freedom Organization) 
initiated the proposal that those community/student/religious/labor 
organizations that are in opposition to the parasitic Democratic Cahill 
machine get together to form a BROAD-based grass roots coalition. The 
purpose of this coalition would be to develop a united progressive political 
platform that would counter the current trends toward destruction and 
inequality in the city, and to run three community residents as candidates 
for these open seats.

After several planning meetings attended by some 20 or 30 activists and 
community members, this united front was formally adopted as "the New 
Brunswick People's Campaign".

"The Question of Revolution is the Seizure of Power". We say these words yet 
we don't really understand what that means. As Amiri Baraka puts so well 
"you want to make a revolution but you can't even elect a dog catcher". This 
campaign is our attempt to put the idea of seizing power (on a local level) 
into practice - that is, once the community elects three of its own to the 
City Council, and wins the majority, it has made the first giant step 
towards claiming control over the city.

We are taking the demands for Women's Centers/Jobs at a living 
wage/community control over the police/community control over redevelopment 
out of the sphere of mere protesting and rhetoric. If we seize power on the 
council, these demands can become realities. If we seize power on the 
council, we can begin to foster a real cultural renaissance in this City: it 
will be the culture of working people, not Starbucks.

This is hard to imagine, I know. But I for one am through with the draining 
and often fruitless protesting mode of the past. I want to dedicate my time 
to building an alternative to the death machine that is turning this City 
inside out.

If we win this Campaign, it will provide a groundbreaking example to cities 
across the nation, and will illustrate how the united front format serves as 
an effective strategy to unite the now scattered members of the working 
class and progressive communities.

This is a very meaningful application of what I believe is the most 
important task of the Left right now: Unite, Don't Split! Our enemy is 
organized, and we MUST MUST begin to organize ourselves as well, and attempt 
to seize some real power.

After four months of organizing and canvassing, we have acquired some 1000 
surveys from members of the community, outlining their needs and ideas in 
terms of establishing new public policy for the city. The Campaign now 
includes some 50 or so dedicated activists. We have a web site 
(www.newbruns.org), a newspaper, and have gotten the backing from some 
prominent local churches, civic leaders, and attorneys. Our united front 
consists of students, democrats, local teenagers, republicans (literally), 
socialists, communists, workers, landlords, church members. Obviously, we 
don't all agree on everything, but we do agree to struggle together in a 
principled way and to unite on the great amount that we do have in common.

This Saturday is the Convention of the People's Campaign. This is the climax 
of our organizing efforts, as everyone will get together and 
debate/nominate/vote on our political platform and candidates. This will be 
a major example of what we call "people's democracy", something we 
understand little about in this country.

I am writing to invite you to join us on Saturday to witness and partake in 
this wonderful and solemn ceremony, where everyday, ordinary people will put 
their ideas and voices forward in an effort to make life better for 
everyone.

The Convention will run from 10 am (registration) to 6pm. You don't have to 
come for the entire time if you can't. It will be at the Paul Robeson 
School, Commercial Ave, New Brunswick. There will be food and child care 
provided. It will be an intense and joyful time.

For more information feel free to call (732-249-9664) or email me. We seek 
your support on whatever level you can offer, even if you can't make it to 
Saturday's event. I look forward to talking with you!

in unity, and with great hope,
Kristina Bas

NEW BRUNSWICK PEOPLE�S CONVENTION

Today, residents from all of New Brunswick�s communities
unite in the struggle for people�s democracy in our
city. We are here to decide the issues that we can all
unite on and to choose 3 candidates who will run in the
November 7, 2000 election for the New Brunswick City
Council.

The City Council is the branch of city government with
the power to pass laws (ordinances) and to appoint city
officials. When the People�s Campaign wins the election
for three seats in November, we will have a majority of
the votes on the City Council. Our candidates will have
the power to pass laws to transform New Brunswick in any
way the people decide. Our candidates will also have the
power to fire corrupt city officials and replace them
with new officials chosen by the people.


THE PROGRAM OF THE PEOPLE�S CAMPAIGN

This morning, we will discuss and vote on our Campaign
Program, our plan to change the city of New Brunswick in
the interest of the people. Our campaign program has
seventeen points ranked in order of importance by over
1,000 New Brunswick residents who completed the People�s
Campaign surveys. The five most important issues the
people chose are:

We have one hour to discuss and vote on final changes to
the Campaign Program. Anyone can go up to the microphone
and use 30 seconds of speaking time to propose a change,
speak in favor of a change or speak against a change.
The Chair will call for a vote on the proposed changes
one at a time. Any proposed change that gets a majority
of the people�s votes will become part of the Campaign
Program. After the one hour of discussion, we will vote
on the entire Campaign Program as a whole.

Any New Brunswick residents and any non-resident
campaign worker can vote on the Program of the People�s
Campaign

THE ELECTION OF OUR CANDIDATES FOR THE CITY COUNCIL

After lunch, we will choose our three candidates who
will run in the November election for City Council. The
candidates must all sign a written oath saying that:

1)  They will support and fight for ALL of the points of
the People�s Campaign Program BEFORE and AFTER they are
elected to the City Council.

2)  They will follow the leadership of the People�
Campaign BEFORE and AFTER they are elected to the City
Council. They will follow all the decisions that the
people vote on at our monthly meetings and the decisions
made by the Steering Committee of the People�s Campaign.

3)  They will always follow the democratic majority rule
of the people of New Brunswick.

The city requirements to be a candidate are that you
must be an American citizen and you must have lived in
New Brunswick for the past year.

Only New Brunswick residents can vote for the candidates
for City Council.

If we have more than 6 candidates running for the three
seats, we will hold a Qualifying Round Vote and keep the
six candidates with the most votes.

Each resident will get to cast three votes, one per each
candidate of their choice.

Candidates need to get 51% of the votes or more to win.

If more than 3 candidates get 51% of the vote or more,
the three candidates with the most votes will win.

If only one or two candidates win 51% of the votes or
more, we will hold a runoff election between the
remaining candidates.

If no candidate wins 51% of the votes or more in the run-
off of election, the two candidates with the most votes
will go into a final runoff election.

THE ELECTION OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE:

After a short  afternoon break, we will vote for the
Steering Committee of the People�s Campaign.

The People�s Campaign holds General Meetings once per
month where New Brunswick residents and non-resident
campaign workers decide the next steps we will take in
the campaign.

In between the General Meetings, the People�s Campaign
is led by the Steering Committee.

The Steering Committee will have 8 members:

(3) - The three candidates for the City Council
(1) - The Campaign Manager
(1) - The Coordinator for the Referendum for an Elected
School Board
(3)  - Three more Steering Committee members-at-large

All New Brunswick residents and non-resident campaign
workers can vote for the members of the Steering
Committee.

We will take nominations and vote for the Campaign
Manager.

We will take nominations and vote for the Coordinator
for the Referendum for an Elected School Board.

We will take nominations and vote for the three Steering
Committee members at-large.

THE ELECTION OF THE WARD LEADERS

The People�s Campaign must grow in all neighborhoods
with the support of every city block. For all city
elections, the city of New Brunswick has been divided up
into six different Wards. Your Ward determines the place
where you and your neighbors must go to vote on election
day. Before we end the People�s Convention, we will
create three Ward organization that will each organize
for the campaign in their area, register everyone to
vote, collect signatures for the Elected School Board
Referendum  and promote our candidates.

The 3 Ward organizations are:

1)  Ward 3 (The Rutgers River Dorms and George St.) +
Ward 6 (College Avenue, Easton Avenue, Hamilton Street,
Somerset Street, Hutchinson St)

2)  Ward 1 (Raritan Gardens, Woodrow Wilson School) +
Ward 2 (Remsen Avenue, Livingston Avenue, Memorial
Homes, Douglass and Cook Campuses)

3) Ward 4 (French Street) + Ward 5 (Paul Robeson
Village, Wright Place, Route 27, Reed Street Apartments)

The residents of each Ward will vote for their Ward
Leader.

(As the People�s Campaign grows in the summer, we will
create a total of six ward organizations, one for each
Ward in New Brunswick.)

The program appeals to the middle class of New Brunswick. There are
different class interests represented within the campaign; the working
class has been nearly entirely excluded from the political process in this
city, and the campaign is working to change that. We've met members of the
middle class, members of the working class, who don't yet recognize that
their class interests lie in unity. It is the goal of the campaign to
show, through our unity and our *action* on our program, that unity around
this program will benefit all of their respective class interests. 

What is this lack of understanding you speak of? What, you think we're
canvassing *any* neighborhoods by saying, "Join the socialist revolution,
vote for the People's Campaign"? I don't *think* so, Chris--instead we've
been surveying, Tom's done crosstabs and statistics on the surveys to see
what different groups' main concerns are, etc. When we wrote the
invitations to join the Campaign, we addressed letters to various commuity
leaders, community groups, small businesses, students, etc--addressing the
different class interests and concerns that are jointly served by unity.
That was before the Campaign took off, so it was a solely NJFO project at
the time. NJFO has *always* attempted to unite a broad class basis in this
united front. 

Certainly the city machine will do everything it can to stop the campaign.
Someone I was speaking with tonight compared the NB city machine to an old
early 20th-century Democratic machine--complete with the danger of
beatings and the inevitability of corruption. The city machine *will*
attack us. The city machine *will* attack NJFO. Tney've done it before.
The task before us, however, is not to become callous opportunists who
abandon our honest political agendas because "someone might not like it."
What we must do is publicize the program of the Campaign, organize, draw
in new people, and lead the vast majority of classes in the City to
recognize that their common interests are best expressed by joining with
the Campaign to put our program in office.

I've not seen NJFO organizers make the claim you say we do. Quote or
citation please? On the other hand, I've seen NJFO organizers commend
Frank for doing such a great job working with his contacts, I've seen NJFO
organizers consistently insist on the importance of student involvement in
the Campaign at all levels, I've seen NJFO organizers discuss the various
ways of getting middle class people involved in this campaign, from
approaching small business owners about the problems they face due to
redevelopment interests to advertising in Hungarian-language publications.

Frank's work is great. I'm very glad he's doing it. After all, approaching
landlords about rent control is difficult, and he's doing it. Good for
him---he's doing what he's good at doing--and raising plenty of funds! The
"necessary concessions" of a united front don't include abandoning one's
right to independent organization, ideology, and activity. To do such
would be pure opportunism, and not reflective of a united front at all.
Instead, we are *open and above-board*. NJFO is not in hiding, and should
not be.

If you *remember* that meeting so well, you'll remember that NJFO voted to
*oppose* narrow slogans and to support broad slogans. Xavier said that
"seize power" doesn't mean you have to be a revolutionary. How exactly is
this exclusionary? Cliff's argument was indeed one I consider
left-sectarianism, but he's well-entitled to express it, and it was not
upheld by the majority of people at the campaign meeting. NJFO was a voice
*against* sectarianism and for the united front around the question of
campaign slogans.

The rest of the paragraph is silly anti-communism that should be
recognized as such. This Campaign has *never* been a home for internal
red-bating, and I would like to see it remain that way.

Um...we "scream" "united front," because this *is* a united front. It
doesn't mean I stop being a Communist, and it doesn't mean Frank stops
being a Republican because the majority of campaign members aren't either.
*Neither* of us gives up the right to independent advocacy. When we
represent the People's Campaign, we represent the *democratically-selected
program*. When I represent myself as a Communist, or a member of NJFO,
however, I represent not *just* that program, but also a socialist
revolutionary program. To pretend otherwise would be politically
reprehensible, dishonest and opportunist. 

The united front does *not* entail *anyone* relinquishing their political
freedom and democratic rights. This is a Communist-to-Republican
coalition, Chris, and the Communists among us aren't any more likely to
stop being so, or pretend to do so, than the Republicans are. When the
city machine attacks us, we'll prove ourselves by our action and by our
program, Chris--the campaign and *all* of its activists, including those
from NJFO. And you know what? We'll sue them for push polling and illegal
campaign tactics if they try those stunts. We're a *real* campaign
organization, and determined to win. The City Machine DOES NOT have the
right to decide what members of the People's Campaign will think, believe
and say. Do you wish to give them that right, Chris?

And seriously, Chris, again, what specifically are your criticisms of how
NJFO has apparently created some kind of campaign disunity? I don't
remember you raising any of this at the general meeting--at which everyone
had *plenty* of time to speak. You think important issues should be raised
there (even though you now are aware that the Baraka confirmation came
*after* that meeting). Why didn't you raise yours in that open, democratic
forum?

That's lovely in theory, Charlotte.  What has been done in practice to
mobilize the middle class and reach out to them to actively promote the
campaign in their eyes?  The actions on the program will never get a chance
to run their course if the election is not won.  And it seriously undermines
our chances to do so if we focus so extensively on the middle class.

The attitude I speak if is evident from your paragraph above, where you
imply a distinction between "middle class" and "working class".  This is
pseudo-Marxist nonsense.  The interests of working people are, of course,
not disparate between lower classes and middle classes.   But you make it
pretty clear in the above paragraph that the middle class is not the working
class to you -- that they are another creature altogether.  That is not only
a tactical mistake, it is an insult to middle class people who are just as
dependent on a paycheck for their daily lives.  This political faux pas
results from the antiquated view of class relations that has yet to be
adapted to life in New Brunswick in the 21st century.  It further
underscores the need for stronger non-Communist leadership in the People's
Campaign.

Don't say it -- do it.  I remember when about a year ago, NJFO managed to
convince a few businessmen and better-off middle class folk to come to a
fundraising meeting for the organization, where beautiful packets were
devised which, on the very first page, had pictures of Lenin and such
illustrious slogans as "Win the Advanced to Communism!"  Needless to say,
there were not many funds raised.  This is the type of nearsightedness and
impractical clinging to outmoded rhetoric that leaves me concerned as to the
fate of the campaign if the campaign is left in NJFO's hands, without
appropriate checks and balances.  This is the type of nonsense I expect from
Amiri Baraka as well -- the "keynote speaker" of our "united front" who also
writes about how we must "throw Republicans in the trash".  United whaaa?

Again, examples, plans, how are we going to do this?  By saying that we are?
The same way that we are allegedly a "united front?"  As far as Communism is
concerned, not only does "someone" not like it, the vast majority of
Americans are utterly alienated from it.  Is your ideology more important
than making people's lives better?  You certainly give me that impression.

What claim are you referring to?  Bring small business owners into a meeting
where X talks about the ballot or the bullet, and how we are going to try
the bullet next if the ballot does not suffice.  See how quickly they leave

No one said anything about hiding.  You mentioned a few messages back the
necessity of allowing people and groups to put forth their "maximum
program", and you cited the example of the unapproved "Revolutionary
Democratic Workers Party" flyers.  I disagreed with you.  There should not
be flyers that do not stress the campaign platform and the common agenda.
The essential issue with the campaign today is that there is no campaign
discipline.  People continue to practice their personal politics.  What
other organization would tolerate something like this -- especially if we
are indeed "in it to win it", and not to vindicate and promote our personal
ideologies?

Why are you putting words in my mouth?  Did I say "exclusionary"?  No, I
said "idiotic".  *I'm* on the left, Charlotte, and I damn near cringed when
I heard the convoluted explanation of why we are not initiating a revolution
to seize power but instead are going for the ballot -- first.  None of the
new outsiders at that meeting showed up again.  I wonder why.

What does that mean?  What part of my paragraph is "silly anti-communism?"

I guess that is why Communists don't win elections.  Their religious fervor
is such that they cannot make practical ammendments to their rhetoric.  The
rhetoric seems to take priority to the goals.

Again, this seems rather half-baked.  We will not prove ourselves by our
action and our program if we are not in office after November.  Suing the
city seems like a great PR move, but hardly wins us the election.  Maybe the
reality of the courtroom is something that has not occurred to you yet.  

We really do want to be a real campaign organization, and it is damn well
time to start acting like it.

This is an issue that becomes clearer to me with each day, and each effort
to import more elements of NJFO's agenda into the People's Campaign -- case
in point, Amiri Baraka.  Good idea, though -- I will begin working on a
statement for the next general meeting.

Canvassing in "middle-class" neighborhoods. Going around to small
businesses to talk to business owners about the Campaign. Sending letters
to small businesspeople. Talking to personal contacts. You know, the
*same* thing that's going on with every other New Brunswick community. I
take it you do not mean to say that "And it seriously undermines
 our chances to do so if we focus so extensively on the middle class."
But, quite frankly, if we follow your plan...all I can see is us *only*
organizing the "middle class." Putting the "middle class" first among the
people, so to speak. Well, this campaign is about putting the *people*
first--that's all the people. Small businessmen, lawyers, doctors, factory
workers, renters, landlords, homeowners, public housing residents,
mothers, children, women, men, Latinos, Blacks, whites, immigrants, the
unemployed, senior citizens--*everyone* who does not benefit from the city
machine's corruption and greed and big business running rampant. It's not
just one of those groups. And it's not NJFO making the mistake--it's you.
You'd have us concentrate on the "middle class" with more extensive
tactics than any other group in the city, apparently. Well--you're on the
campaign--GO DO IT! Take the intiative, Chris! Frank's doing so, and doing
a damn good job of it. If you want the campaign to organize middle class
people and you have concrete ideas on how we can do it better--why don't
you either suggest them or actually put them into practice rather than
saying NJFO isn't coming up with enough ideas for your taste?

Um, small business owners, doctors, and lawyers---the "middle class" I
refer to, are *not* part of the working class. Maybe landlords.. You're
the one with the terminology of "middle class", Chris--I assumed this is
the group of people about whom you speak. But I really do not see that
this is the time or place for another long discussion about varying
conceptions of class and economic strata in the United States today,

That's not an insult to small business owners, doctors, or lawyers. I'm
not saying they don't work. Quite frankly, I *seriously* doubt most of the
above have *any* class concept of themselves as "working class." Even most
of the American working class doesn't have that consciousness, Chris. So I
don't think I'll worry about that, because the small business owners,
doctors and lawyers who think they are middle class--are right! 

(And who are the middle class you refer to if they are the working class?
Do you mean upper strata of the working class? You introduced the term to
this debate.)

If you think "we need stronger non-Communist leadership," than be a
non-Communist leader, Chris. Do something. Put something into practice,
organize the middle class--and if you *do work in the campaign* the
campaign will recognize you democratically for your work. It's sort of
like Frank. He's recognized because he does a lot for the campaign. Xavier
is recognized because he does a lot for the campaign. Samantha is
recognized because she does a lot for the campaign. If you think "we need
non-Communist leadership," don't just sit there engaging in red-baiting.
*Be* a non-communist leader.

Hahahaha! Chris--NJFO members are in campaign leadership because they are
doing a lot of campaign work, including work with the above categories of
people. We're presenting a broad platform, canvassing everywhere, talking
to everyone. United front doesn't mean giving up political independence,
Chris, and I don't think you understand that. NJFO isn't an opportunist
organization. NJFO studies Marx and Lenin; NJFO sits on the editorial
board of and writes a lot of the articles for _Unity & Struggle_ with the
line "Win the advanced to Communism!" And yeah, a bunch of us are Commies.
Despite all that arduous baggage, NJFO's won respect in the community,
among campaign activists, New Brunswick residents and students for the
*work that is done*. 

Sorry we're not the kind of callow opportunists who change and hide our
politics to please some businessmen and get their money, Chris. If we were
that dishonest, we'd be better off with the city machine--so you should be
happy that NJFO is forthright, open and above-board with our politics and
our struggles. Once again, NJFO isn't even a majority on the steering
committee. NJFO's endorsements will not be all-NJFO by any stretch of the
imagination. Haven't you got it? We're saying what we are, what we believe
and putting that into practice. We aren't looking to "take over the
campaign," we're looking to foster democracy in NB--that's why when NJFO
*proposed* the campaign in the first place, we *did* so with clauses for
recall, political freedom, and open democratic discussion and majority
rule.

By holding events, canvassing, speaking to contacts, organizing meetings
and events, holding motorcades and talking to people--all the stuff we're
doing now, all the stuff that NJFO members are actively involved in, all
the stuff reported at the general meeting and in the committees. That's
how. And bigger and better later. What are your proposals, Chris, for
organizing? Would you like to start putting them in *action*?

Um, we are a united front. And the more our united front expands, the
better. But we represent multiple class interests, organizations and
sectors of the NB population united around a common cause. That *is* a
united front. 

You are basically saying we should become callow opportunists who run and
hide at the faintest hint of red-bating. Chris--sorry, but we actually
believe in being open and above-board. NJFO isn't gonna stop putting out
_U&S_, we're not going to stop developing and publicizing our line.
Period. We believe in educating people about Communism and showing them
what we are *through our democratic practice*. I am appalled that you seem
to think that abridging Communists of their political rights is an
appropriate part of a democratically-run campaign.

See, the thing about the Campaign is--people can *disagree* with that
line, just as people can advocate it. If Campaign members disagree with
that line, they will *say so*, and the business owners will see debate in
action. Small business owners have got to deal with the fact that they are
one part of the coalition, just like Communists and students and tenants
and landlords and Republicans and factory workers. Else we're *not* having
a united front at all, but some sort of strange pandering front that
doesn't lead small business owners to recognize the value of unity at all.

Any group has the right to put out whatever it wishes. It can't say it's
put out by the Campaign if it's not. That's the only limitation. "Campaign
discipline" doesn't mean relinquishing political independence. It means
putting effort into practice. It means making sure we go canvass, it means
making sure we motorcade, it means bringing people to the convention.
*That's* the kind of "discipline" that matters. Or are you
advocating...<gasp> democratic centralism? It's discipline in *practice*
that means we're in it to win it. NJFO members are showing that.

I won't choose to speculate unless I actually speak to them, or *someone*
does. Did you? Otherwise, you're attributing motive without proof. The
discussion was too *long*, perhaps, but we're not in the censorship
business at the Campaign in order to theoretically appease the
sensibilities of one group in a broad united front.

So we should run "stealth commies" for office? Forget open and
above-board, let's play let's pretend and be opportunists without
principle. That's the way to go to make a change! We don't advocate
revolution in the name of the Campaign, and we've argued and voted against
those tactics.

Exposing city machine illegal tactics would be a PR coup, but it's not
something I'm eagerly anticipating or something. We are a real campaign
organization. We show that in our practice. NJFO members are doing that,
at least, with a lot of other excellent activists, non-Communists. Who,
incidentally, don't seem prone to this type of red-baiting, perhaps
because they understand that united front doesn't mean silencing everyone
who doesn't agree with them?

What are your criticisms? What are your suggestions for improving our
practice? (You know, ones that don't violate the democratic campaign
rules. That involve actual outreach.) I bet Sam would like to hear them.
You say the issue becomes clearer--what are the clear criticisms? When
you're making these sort of allegations, one must be specific, or one is
guilty of engaging in empty red-baiting with absolutely no solutions or
suggestions for practical *work*.

Message:

You're absolutely right, Nikki.  Point 1 speaks precisely to my own
disillusionment -- no one has come to me with any work, aside from computer
issues.  The failure of organizing the skills that we have, as well as
incorporating new talent into the campaign by pushing the simple,
progressive platform that we decided on, is the reason why everyone is so
busy and not much new active blood is flowing through the campaign.  When I
brought up the possibility of mobilizing the middle class, I was essentially
told that this is not our primary focus.  Fine, but then what of those who
feel more comfortable speaking to the issues that unite us all?

My alienation is not due to personal beef.  My personal beef is due to
alienation.  It does not have to be this way.  The fact that others I have
talked with feel similarly is the reason why I have not simply bailed.

I will try to keep the list activity to a minimum, since my discussion with
Charlotte is essentially not bringing any further light to the issues.

I hope some other people get involved and voice their opinions.

Chris

Matt,

	"Put Republicans in the garbage can"

	Is this an Amiri Baraka quote?  If I recall correctly, 
it is.  How does one expect to win the Republican vote
with this model of acceptance and cross class "unity" ?

With all due respect, I've been trying to stay out of 
this conversation since I feel I have little of 
substance to add.  When it comes to sarcasm, however,
I too could find a response to damn near every post on this
board.  Fortunately sarcasm and other assorted attempts 
at humour have already been deemed as unacceptable forms
of expression on this list (re: Jim's rather clever parody a few
messages back).  

Given the "rules of engagement" as implied by certain members of
this list, your post borders on vicious and slanderous attack.

Perhaps we can have a vote on what forms of expression are 
permitted?

Subject:DevCo and more
Message:


I called DevCo today for the first time on this campaign, which says something  - my info has been coming from friends who have called them or gone to the planning office - I sense a tendency in myself to stay away from the people directly in power to stay out of their radar screen but I think this is wrong - they have the info, must provide, and we have to get used to dealing with reality.  I think it is important for us to infterface directly with the people we are criticizing, whatever reasons we may come up with to ourselves for not.  

The project is still as described, although I got more details:

1.  200 luxury apartments at 1200 - 1500 a piece.  They are calling these luxury apartments to market them.  In fact this is what DevCo calls a "going market rate" which is what it will take to recoup their borrowing costs.  Flavio asked the question if they could cut up these into smaller apartments or make them less fancy to be able to market them at a cheaper price.  We may be fooled by them saying market rate - they justify the cost of the apartments.  Im not a developer so I dont know what is possible here in terms of getting cheaper housing.
2. hotel and conference center
3.  7500 sq ft retail space
4.  private health club and pool
5. restarurant and hootel lobby on entrance level
6.  300 parking spots
7.  Heldrich policy center

Financing:

1. $1.3 M a year for training center, $8.5M total, provided by state
2. Advance Group is borrowing money to do the apartments.  I think they did the mall.
3. DevCo as a nonprofit is borrowing money at a cheaper rate for the hotel and conference center
4.  As of now the apartments and hotel/conference center are separately financed - one is not subsidizing the other
5. The conference center is the kind that serves smaller groups so there are rooms for 30-60 participants.  On the weekends they will convert some of the space to a larger "ballroom"
6.  Taxes on the property will be to the tune of $1M versus the 90K they are getting now.

This is their logic - look, its largely private investment, we are offering market rate apartments, it will pay off big in terms of revenues.

They are trying to create this sheek thing that is marketed a certain way.  They must feel that going upscale is the only way to develop and have ths be a success. In terms of financing a large project such as theirs they may be right.  A conference center in NB may not be a financial success if it is not a sheek self enclosed thing.

I have heard comments from storeowners that they feel that it will not be able to sustain itself monetarily.  From DevCos perspective, historically alot of the development activity in the downtown has come from government buildings and the hospitals.  Their perspective must be that unless they create something extra special it wont sustain itself financially. They will be anxious as to whether this takes or not as a private project.  They are not taking Charlottes point into account as to how hard it is to invest downtown for small business due to govt red tape.  Frank also makes the point that zoning often restricts investment in the town by smaller capital.

Given all this,  I still want to write up a petition to get signed on the convention day.  What should we say?  I think - more retail space, allow displaced businesses first picks, public access to pool and conference hall, redesign apartments so they will be cheaper.  They will likely respond that other than the retail the other changes will make the building something that will not be able to finance itself, that this is an unrealistic demand.  One very charitable local business that is getting displaced from the area - and is helping us out with the convention urged me not to try to stop the whole plan, but to advocate at least for more retail space.  This business owner said to me that actually alot of the businesses on the street are very self-centered and dont pay their workers very well, dont care about the community.  Again, local business is not always great for workers.  He was glad they were wiping out the whole block of businesses and starting fresh.

So anyway I think that we need to really interface with the community more but as we do we will find out that things arent as easily characterized as they once seemed.  This is the challenge of the campaign - to really take in conflicting viewpoints from the community as new information and to work with it, rather than blowing the person off by pinning them as one way or another, because these are the people that have been active and struggling.  I say struggling because I have been talking to some people at the Suydam St Reformed Church, many PRAB people go there, and the contact I am supposed to meet with spoke with me briefly.  She took offense to my critique of the youth center, said, they had "struggled "to get it and made the comment that she feels she has to work with reality.  To us that may seem like a word for "give in"  - I got very discouraged and felt here is someone with whom I dont know how to go further because shes telling me she is accepting the status quo, and she knows more of the status quo than I do so  I have to respect that.  This is the point where I have to say - OK , right now she is telling me she doesnt see the point of the campaign, so I have to hang in there with her anyway, and not give up.  I think there is such a tendency to see people as either onthe right side or the wrong side and that is detrimental to our organizing.  If we dont grapple with the status quo-appearing people, who we often can criticize as not having the working class in their true interest, unfortunately we will relegate ourselves to idea land which is another criticism people have had of our meetings - too much talk about what should be not enough about concrete nuts and bolts of city functioning.

Which brings me to another point.  I have heard from two key representatives of the African American and Latino community that they strongly support the campaign but do not want to see a campaign that is strongly negative and attacking to use words that they used.  I think we need to really listen here these are representatives of the communities we are trying to organize and if this is one of their comments on our campaign we have to take it seriously.  Unlike people who have learned how to lobby for their opinions in this campaign (which I am learning I have to do) these are people who will state their opinion once and if it isnt taken seriously they will not repeat it.  The campaign leaders need to think about how to create spaces for such opinions to be expressed and then how to act on them.  If key reps are saying this, then if we shift something for themin terms of the way we run the campaing it will make their organizing that much easier and we can take care of areas that they are not covering.

On to I think the last main point of this damn thing.  It has to do with campaign organization.  Early on in the campaign I learnt a lesson - say I think something would make the campaign more successful, but generally expressed opinion is against that or the committee leader isnt planning that right now, or the steering committee doesnt think its important.  What do I do?  I decided that rather than complaining I should keep my mouth shut and try to do it on my own.  But then I started applying this to alot of areas where I thought something should be different - and lo and behold I am a fucking chicken without a head planning 3 different types of meetings for outreach, trying to do research for RTK, writing letters and flyers for media, reaching out to businesses and residents and churches, and promising things I cant do.  The other way, as I am learning, would have been to be focused and more successful doing one or two things and lobby for the other stuff to be done by someone else.  But I didnt have faith that those things would get done if I wasnt on them.    I think what we need is for there to be a clear way for opinions on how things could go better to be 1. encouraged 2. expressed 3. taken seriously by leadership.  Then leadership can say - OK this person has a perspective that is important - its different from mine but they are talking to people who are telling them about a different perspective, and there must be a kernel of truth in what they are saying.  How can we make the campaign receptive to this perspective?  And how can we deploy our resources as a campaign to address this?  I welcome leadership to tell me Zofia do this one thing and do it well, as long as I can trust that the other things I was concerned were getting left out of the mix - in this case the Spanish community, general outreach, the churches and business community will get listened to and taken care of.  Also I think committee leaders should be seen as coordinators who can request people on their committees to do most of the work - the more time the leaders spend busting their butt, the less coordinated and thought out will be the work of their committees.

Related to this is the middle class thing.  I definitely feel we need to reach out more to the leaders in NB community, and alot of them are middle class.  Im glad we focused on the working class so much because otherwise they would never have come in, and I think we learned loads about the community.  But to give our campaign legitimacy, knowledge, and power we need to welcome everyone and use outreach techniques so that noone in this town can say they havent heard of us - right now that is not the case.  Once we attract people lets figure out how we can keep them with us.  People really do get turned off at our general meetings. Im not saying we shouldnt be ourselves but lets try to figure out things we can add to our approach that make people feel more welcomed, invited to be a part of the campaign, and listened to when they do open their mouths to give their opinion.  Not everyone realizes that if they go in with several people, prepare their talking points ahead of time and then lobby well for it in the meeting they may have a chance at influencing the assembly.  We need to change the way opinions get heard AND we need to actively educate those joining us for the very first time  as to how to make the campaign something they can work with and how power in the campaign functions - and Im afraid alot of people  dont have the time or energy it takes to really lobby people to get something changed.

This is a very valid criticism, Nikki, and I'd like to see it fully
discussed and addressed.

I had no such intention--I speak as a Communist who is a member of NJFO,
as it was those particular members Chris seemed to be addressing. I
certainly have no intention of implying that every member of NJFO is a
Communist or that NJFO is a Communist organization. If that's the case,
then we need to work on our approaches to criticism, discussion and line
struggle, and develop something beneficial to the group and its members. A
detailed discussion of _U&S_ would be a good topic for a meeting
discussion, and I hope you'll feel your questions, criticisms and ideas
are welcome in that discussion.

Well, I don't think our motives are weird, or especially impractical. No
political group is exempt from opportunism-but pretending to not believe
in something one believes in , or to downplay it to currry favor with a
particular class group isn't in line with being open and above-board, and
it isn't in line with the united front. It isn't an issue of martyrdom,
it's an issue of the principles of the united front being undermined.

I would certainly say that ideally, such a vote should have been held. It
should have been. However, to attribute this to a sort of underhandedness,
scheming or undue influence is unsupported. The Steering Committee who
voted to put Amiri on the schedule when he became available was not a
majority-NJFO steering committee. It was not the result of NJFO control or
machinations but a vote that Amiri Baraka, since he was now available,
would be a positive speaker for the convention.

The People's Campaign absolutely should be pushing the platform--something
I repeatedly advocated as the way to attract broad forces to the campaign.
Groups within the campaign should absolutely do so as well, something I
see NJFO doing. However, this doesn't nullify the right to political
independence within the united front. We all need to push the program, and
push our lines on why the program is important. They will vary, they will
be at odds-there are variant interests involved in this campaign, and all
of those interests and organizations should be on equal footing in a
democratic forum.

Chris, I agree with having no particular desire to continue to clog this
list with this discussion. As a matter of fact, I was discussing this just
last night, and decided to 'respond unless it continues forever.' We can
continue the discussion in a more appropriate and less disruptive arena,
if you so choose. However, I still think the list would benefit, as would
the Campaign, from your proposals on practical ways to reach out to the
middle class--the middle class should be brought into the campaign, and
you're obviously interested in seeing that it happens. Apart from this
debate, what do you suggest the campaign take on? Those could be
enormously productive ideas for the campaign as a whole.

Message:

Childcare is a major part of our proposed program, and a major part of 
saturday. I need help from people to make it run as smoothly and 
professionally as possible. This is what is needed:

1. PEOPLE- wE  WILL Work in 2 hour shifts. I am asking non-residents first, 
and then if desperate, residents. But there seems to be a decent number of 
non-residents in the campaign so please let me know when in the day you 
would like to volunteer.

2. Paper, poster board, white sheets, markers, crayons
if anyone has access to any of these things let me know asap.

3. A cassette player and children's music if you got it.

Louise

Zofia- I think such a petition should demand "mixed income"  housing--that 
is, there should be some % of low-middle income, which would imply a certain 
% that is subsidized (They HATE that term, but every tax cut for the 
sowntown businesses is a SUBSIDY!)  They should also be encouraged to 
include social amenities, such as a computer/job training facility, day-care 
center, etc, w/in the development as a way of getting tax-credits to support 
the low-income subsidized units.  By no means should we allow this to be 
only LUXURY apartments down town.  It'll be the worst of SOHO & Hoboken 
combined, without the arts and historic preservation!  Matthew

I hope everyone is doing well.

In a spirit of unity, I must for the first time speak of an issue on the 
discussion group.

Please note the person in charge of the elected BOE question is quoted by the 
Home News Tribune as stating the issue is personally being pushed to further 
a Revolutionary Democratic Worker's Party. 

I have received a number of phone messages over the last few months. The main 
thrust is that the Campaign is not worth joining due to the comments made 
concerning, for an example, a Revolutionary Democratic Worker's Party. This 
is the second time around that scores of established leaders and activists 
have mentioned how they WILL NOT join the campaign because of their 
perception of sectarianism and hard heartedness of a small few that are in 
positions of leadership. The campaign should have doubled after the second 
meeting but has stayed ominiously level. Why? We have been losing the 
"moderates" who are more intent on getting an elected Board of Education in 
order to help children, for an example, rather than help a Revolutionary 
Democratic Worker's Party. 

Now we have another opportunity with residents because we now have 
candidates. As an example, are we to turn residents off with rhetoric such as 
a Revolutionary Democratic Worker's Party again?

I speak sincerely as I personally see the average of fifteen new votes we 
lose every week. Maintaining my constituency is consuming valuable time 
whereas my constituents should be donating money, office space, outreach, 
voter/election work, research and covering City Council meetings ... and many 
other responsibilities.

I am sincerely sorry I have to write this as I sincerely view everyone in 
this campaign as a brother or sister. I want to say none of the above is an 
attack on anyone. However, the situation above is a recurring one. I am sorry 
if this sounds corny but I look to you all as a family to help us sort out 
this kind of situation.

Once again I hope everyone is doing well.

Newly formed slate cites New Brunswick's drug problem 




Published in the Home News Tribune 5/14/00 

By KEN SERRANO
STAFF WRITER



Three independents running as a slate from a group calling itself a 
grass-roots, cross-cultural and multiethnic movement say they will vie for 
three City Council seats in November against incumbent Democrats.

At a convention yesterday at the Paul Robeson Community School, the New 
Brunswick People's Campaign nominated Curtis Warren Sr., Danny Rosado and 
Keith Joseph to run for the four-year council terms in November.

The convention drew about 100 people, most of them city residents who cast 83 
ballots in the nomination of council candidates.

The three candidates have until June 6 to file petitions to run as 
independents, said Flavio Komuves, a Somerset attorney and a member of the 
People's Campaign, who oversaw the balloting yesterday.

The People's Campaign, a coalition of veteran activists, socialists, 
feminists, landlords, business owners, students and disgruntled Republicans 
and Democrats, say they are waging a battle against an entrenched Democratic 
political machine in New Brunswick.

"It's a huge fight," said Warren, 46, who works security at First Baptist 
Church of Lincoln Gardens in Franklin. "We're fighting against old-boy 
politics, against huge money and old ideas. But we're not here to tear down 
the political machine, we're just here to do better."

Warren stressed what has been a talking point for many of the people 
associated with the People's Campaign: "How can we be a health-care city and 
let this drug problem here go on like it is?''

He said he would work to promote joint efforts with health-care companies in 
New Brunswick to deal with that and other problems. 

Warren has been involved with the New Brunswick Coalition Against Police 
Brutality.

Rosado, 42, who worked as an airplane mechanic in the Dominican Republic 
before immigrating to the United States, said through a translator that she 
would work against domestic violence in the city and for more recreational 
facilities for young people.

Joseph, 29, who has been associated with the New Jersey Freedom Organization, 
a group of what he called revolutionary democrats, said, "We want to make New 
Brunswick a city for people, not the corporations that are exploiting it."

He said the People's Campaign canvassed 1,000 residents from around the city 
and has established its platform based on the information it received.

The group's 17-point platform, also voted on yesterday, includes working 
toward placing a question on the November ballot on whether the city board of 
education should be an elected body.

Joseph Smith, who said he has worked on a door-to-door campaign for the past 
five years on putting that question to voters, will continue doing so for the 
People's Campaign as a member of the steering committee. Smith said his 
efforts to register voters and push for the referendum is part of a broader 
effort to establish a Revolutionary Democratic Workers' Party.

The People's Campaign platform includes establishing a civilian police review 
board with subpoena power to investigate police misconduct, building bike 
paths and providing publicly subsidized child care for every child in the 
city.

The three Democrats who are seeking re-election to the council are Robert 
Recine, Joseph Schrum and Jimmie Cook.

Hi! 

Just wanted to cite the HNT article, which quotes all of our *wonderful*
candidates (Congratulations, Curtis, Danny and Keith! We couldn't ask for
a better slate of representatives!) and puts our issues out there as a
campaign--including health care, women's issues, the city machine,
alternative transportation, community control over police and education,
etc. 

Speaking of yesterday, it was an exhilarating, overwhelming experience of
people's democracy in action. We took part in the real rebirth of New
Brunswick yesterday. I don't want to misquote Curtis, but his slogan was
excellent: "Vote for three to set us free!" That's what this Campaign is
all about--democracy for all in New Brunswick, where the people run the
City Council, not the other way around. When all seven candidates signed
the pledge to abide by the leadership of the people, it was a powerful
moment, indelibly declaring that this Campaign belongs to the people, that
this candidates are the highest expressions of democracy-- OF, BY and FOR
the people. 

The next months will be difficult and joyous and stressful and incredible,
full of unity and full of struggle. After yesterday, more than ever, I am
confident that the Campaign and its candidates will come through in
November unified and strong, having organized the people of this city to
recognize what is rightfully ours. Our candidates--and our whole
Campaign--are true freedom fighters.

Message:

Friends,

After our wonderfully successful convention we find ourselves in need
of new flyers.  This new flyer, which promotes the platform and the candidates,
should certainly do the trick.

This couldn't have been done without Jim who helped out greatly with the content.  
I think we've done our best and (in my opinion) it looks great despite the time crunch.

It's available on the web site for review at:

http://www.newbruns.org/~mike/campaign_flyer_after_convention.doc

I should also mention that I've placed all of the media work I've 
submitted to the campaign on the website, available at:

Subject:Canvassing Experience / "From the masses, to the masses"
Message:

An experience I had canvassing today:

Knocking on a door on Townsend Street, I was greeting by a 
man in his 50s.  I told him I was with the New Brunswick People's
Campaign, and we were collecting signatures for petitions for
an elected school board.  He immediately ushered me in.

I was not even across the doorway before he was probing me
with questions: "What is your name?" "Who are you with?" 
"Where is your office?"  

I met his wife in the kitchen.  Both were more than happy to
put their signatures toward an elected school board.  But I
was not in the house more than 15 seconds when the man turned
to me, looked me right in the face, and said "Your flyers are
completely overboard and ridiculous.  What are you doing?"

I asked him which flyers he had in mind.  He told me he meant
the yellow ones.  "The ones with the name Block on Lock," he said,
explicitly remembering the name of the organization written on
those flyers.  "That's not how you go about running a campaign.
I've lived in this town for 40 years.  This is *not* the kind of
message that appeals to people."

I assured the man that, as a representative of the People's
Campaign, I stood as just that -- a representative of the 
People, their platform, and the candidates they chose to run
for City Council.  

He and his wife both seemed pleased with my attitude as they both 
enthusiastically signed the petition,
emphasizing the need for democratic and progressive change
in the city.

We shook hands, the gentleman wishing me and the Campaign
much luck this year.  I assured him I would do everything in
my power to properly represent the will of the people in my
work.

Food for thought.

James Luceno

Thanks for all the work that's been done on the website, and adding the

I know that www.newbruns.org was the only domain name close to what we
wanted that was available when you registered it, and it's a good domain
name. I did want to let y'all know, however, that www.peoplescampaign.net

3. Change full employment to Employment training and jobs for New Brunswick residents - it makes it more clear to people that we know how we will do this.

Can you sprinkle the more middle-class oriented pieces throughout the list?

Friends,

After our wonderfully successful convention we find ourselves in need
of new flyers.  This new flyer, which promotes the platform and the candidates,
should certainly do the trick.

This couldn't have been done without Jim who helped out greatly with the content.  
I think we've done our best and (in my opinion) it looks great despite the time crunch.

It's available on the web site for review at:

http://www.newbruns.org/~mike/campaign_flyer_after_convention.doc 

I should also mention that I've placed all of the media work I've 
submitted to the campaign on the website, available at:

Thanks
- Michael

MIDDLESEX COUNTY: Judge bars cop's testimony at trial 




Published in the Home News Tribune 5/17/00 

Defense says statements separate from brothel case

By MICHELLE SAHN
STAFF WRITER

Prosecutors will not be allowed to use New Brunswick police detective James 
Marshall's statements about his alleged drug-related activity at a trial on 
charges he and Sgt. Marco Chinchilla ran a house of prostitution in the city, 
a judge ruled yesterday.

Judge Barnett E. Hoffman listened to arguments yesterday morning about other 
statements made by Marshall to investigators in connection with 121 Jersey 
Ave. in the city -- the site of an alleged brothel the two cops are accused 
of running. Hoffman told the attorneys he will rule on the other statements 
after considering their arguments.

The two officers, along with three co-defendants, face a joint trial in 
September in connection with the Jersey Avenue site. Marshall is facing 
other, separate trials in connection with two other alleged brothels, 
allegations of bribery and narcotics-related charges.

Lawyers for both officers said the two men, both 16-year veterans of the 
force, are innocent. Both Marshall and Chinchilla were suspended without pay 
from their jobs in December 1998.

Yesterday's arguments in state Superior Court, New Brunswick, centered on 
whether Marshall's July 28, 1998, statement to investigator Virgil Angellini 
of the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office and detective Joseph Celli of the 
state police can be admitted in the September joint trial.

The question was whether the other defendants - Chinchilla, Luis Posadas, 
Michelle Thibeault and Joyce Kathy Sweeney -- will receive a fair trial if 
Marshall's statements are admitted.

Hoffman said it would be a stretch to find how Marshall's statements about 
narcotics are related to the September trial, which will not involve the 
drug-related charges lodged against the detective.

Assistant Middlesex County Prosecutor Lawrence Welle had argued that part of 
the statement -- in which Marshall said he provided a drug dealer with the 
work schedule of narcotics cops, and seized drugs from informants, then 
returned them -- should be admitted because it shows a pattern of misconduct.

But Hoffman said those statements would be prejudicial and cannot be admitted 
at the September trial.

Hoffman heard arguments from Welle and defense attorneys about Marshall's 
statements in connection with 121 Jersey Ave.

Welle contended the statements should be admissible. He said when 
investigators questioned Marshall, he admitted various kinds of official 
misconduct. For example, the detective said he knew a house of prostitution 
was operating at 121 Jersey Ave. and did nothing to stop it, said Welle.

During the interview, Marshall initially denied any knowledge of a brothel at 
121 Jersey Ave., then gradually admitted knowing more and more about it, 
Welle said.

Welle said he also plans to use other evidence, such as witnesses' testimony 
and advertisements placed in magazines for the establishment, to show that 
site was a house of prostitution.

He said references to codefendants can be deleted from the statement before 
it's presented to the jury and said the panel can be told not to use the 
statement against the codefendants.

But Chinchilla's attorney, Barry Albin, said the statement is hearsay and 
should not be admitted, because during the joint trial he won't have the 
opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the statements -- Marshall.

Albin said he will argue 121 Jersey Ave. was not a brothel, and said during 
cross-examination he can question the credibility of the two witnesses who 
are expected to testify it was a house of prostitution.

"(Chinchilla) has the right to contest every element (of the indictment)," 
said Albin. "If witnesses can't be cross-examined, then you're denying him a 
fundamental right."

He questioned whether there was a feasible way to craft instructions to the 
jury to ensure that the panel only consider Marshall's statement in the case 
against Marshall, not in the cases against the other codefendants.

Subject:Another canvassing experience. Thank you Cliff.
Message:

I had a canvassing experience on Wednesday. It was different from 
Jim's on Monday. 

Audrey and I were walking down Suydam St. and four guys and a kid
were 
up on a porch. We stopped and I asked them if I could pitch them
about 
the campaign. 

Guys: "You guys hooked up with Cliff?"

Paul: "Yeah."

Guys: "Alright."

Paul: "Cool, we're trying to change how this city's run. First we're 
gonna fire Craterface, then we're gonna send the good cops down to 
fire the housing authority in NB Homes."

Guys: "Yea, these cops are outta hand. Things are all messed up in 
this joint. We're gotta do something about this. Where do I sign? I'm 
gonna vote this year. How do I register?"

Paul: "Yea, we can hook up all of that. Hey, what do you guys think 
about Chinchilla and Marshall? That judge is looking to let them off 
for sure."

Guys: "Yea, I saw the paper. Marshall busted EVERYBODY. He jumped 
outta trees, hid in garbage cans. Everything ... That guy's a
murderer 
[Marshall] ... those two [cops] are kingpins ... they should go to 
trial like a black drug dealer ... they should go to jail just like 
everybody else!"

45 minutes later we bailed, everybody was wound up over our 
discussion. I had four pages of quotes from two guys. They said "Put 
all of that in your paper!"  These guys never voted before and now 
they're talking about seizing power.

I just want to thank Cliff. DOWN WITH ALL FORMS OF SECTARIANISM! 
   In Unity and for the sake of the of the United Front--Paul

This is indeed an Amiri Baraka quote.  Placed back in the context of it 
being one line out of a broader call to action, which to some up is: "The 
question of revolution is the seizure of power", then we can understand that 
Baraka is refering to the Republicans who hold Political Power, and who 
represent the insidious interests of imperialism with this political power, 
who make the lives of the great majority of life on earth as hellacious as 
they can.  Not to be confused with the blue-collar Republicans who hold down 
full-time jobs, drink beer and watch the Mets on the weekends, and have been 
fooled by some misquided sense of Patriotism that Bush Lite isn't going to 
put him or her into the frying pan next.  But I agree that it is these folks 
with whom we must build unity.  There are those who haven't yet committed 
fully one way or another, and we will continue to struggle with them while 
we can.  I hope they cast their lot with the people, ultimately.

Hey, man...give yourself some credit. Remember that sketch you made for the 
campaign logo?  It started an entire wave of creative thought and energy 
resulting in the banner that we now have.  Mao said, "A single spark starts 
a prairy fire."

First of all, I would avoid trying to become the Language Police.  It's bad 
form.  I happened to find Jim's "clever parody" particularly amusing.  I 
also disagreed with most of it.  And not to get too trite, but if you really 
are interested in calling out "vicious and slanderous attacks", then I 
suggest you take a closer look at what your buddy Chris spewed about Amiri 
Baraka before you jump to his defense.  You don't have to agree with 
everything Baraka says.  But for chriminy sakes, at least take the time to 
investigate who he is, what he's accomplished, what he represents, what he's 
written, and what opportunities he's opened to us by struggling with over 
the thorny issues of ideological struggle put to practice in the city of his 
birth--Newark--because he refused to sell out, putting his own life on the 
line for decades to make this world a better place, to where he can pack an 
auditorium in Italy, South Africa or South Carolina because he is respected 
all over the world for his teachings and writings that have him listed nest 
to WEB DuBois and Langston Hughes as among the most important Afro American 
writers ever, and then he STILL remains humble enough to open up his home to 
the public ever month for revolutionary culture because the city fathers 
don't think it's important enough to divest public funds for, that he 
doesn't sleep nights because it's the only time he has left in the day to 
write after extending himself to everyone he can, to where he spent nearly 
every cent he made (during the only month of the year that he's fully 
employed) investing in projects that will advance the cause...WHY?  because 
he's that committed and that strong and THAT, my friend, is why certain 
people need to step off their high-horse and see if there's something that 
can be learned from Amiri Baraka before they trip on their infantile and 
inflated sense of self-worth.  And if that offends you, then you're on the 
wrong side of history.  Later.
Matthew

Subject:Candidate flyer updated -- also, request for candidate quotes/bios
Message:

Hi all,

    Just wanted to let you know that the new flyer has been updated
to include the necessary legal tag line ('paid for by the People's Campaign'),
two more platform items (that's all that would fit) and the phone number
has been updated.

    Also, be warned that there are currently some DNS problems resolving
www.newbruns.org, (should be "resolved" by tomorrow)
so grab a copy at:

http://151.198.10.71/~mike/campaign_flyer_after_convention.doc

    Also, I know this has been circulating around via word of mouth, but just
a reminder that we NEED quotes and bios from the candidates!  Ideally,
we would like to two (one short, one longer) quotes and two bios for each 
candidate.  

Thanks,
- Mike

Subject:RE: [nbpeoplescampaign] Media Committee Minutes 5/17/00
Message:


In addition to this media activities, I think the following should
be considered:

1--A free public service ad should be placed on cable channel
6. This might be a good spot to announce intership opportunities.

2--A public service announcement should be made for WRSU. As
in the above, it should stress interships and voter registration
help. The message needs to be nonpartisanly phrased. I suggest
Darryle Lamont Jenkin's skills be used here.

3--City council and school board meetings should be videotaped.
We have a git-darn right to do so and must use this option. The
video should then be edited and a Quick-Time movie should be
established on the Website.

4--I am in the process of writing letters on the Election Law
Enforcement Commission re Cahill and the Committee to Keep Politics
Out of Our Schools. I have been in contact with ELEC. Likewise,
I have significant information on the enviornmental contamination
of the Mile Run Brook beyond Rhodia. These letters will be developed
on behalf of others as tactically advised.

5--The issue of increased taxation regarding the fallow land
and the Lord Stirling School construction has been connected.
The amount in lost tax revenue is several hundred thousand dollars.
The connection is to be pronounced at the Lord Stirling School
groundbreaking ceremony in June. Candidates should perhaps take
the lead on this matter and in a controlled setting.

I had a canvassing experience on Wednesday. It was different
from 
Jim's on Monday. 

Audrey and I were walking down Suydam St. and four guys and a
kid
were 
up on a porch. We stopped and I asked them if I could pitch them
about 
the campaign. 

Guys: "You guys hooked up with Cliff?"

Paul: "Yeah."

Guys: "Alright."

Paul: "Cool, we're trying to change how this city's run. First
we're 
gonna fire Craterface, then we're gonna send the good cops down
to 
fire the housing authority in NB Homes."

Guys: "Yea, these cops are outta hand. Things are all messed
up in 
this joint. We're gotta do something about this. Where do I sign?
I'm 
gonna vote this year. How do I register?"

Paul: "Yea, we can hook up all of that. Hey, what do you guys
think 
about Chinchilla and Marshall? That judge is looking to let them
off 
for sure."

Guys: "Yea, I saw the paper. Marshall busted EVERYBODY. He jumped

outta trees, hid in garbage cans. Everything ... That guy's a
murderer 
[Marshall] ... those two [cops] are kingpins ... they should
go to 
trial like a black drug dealer ... they should go to jail just
like 
everybody else!"

45 minutes later we bailed, everybody was wound up over our 
discussion. I had four pages of quotes from two guys. They said
"Put 
all of that in your paper!"  These guys never voted before and
now 
they're talking about seizing power.

I just want to thank Cliff. DOWN WITH ALL FORMS OF SECTARIANISM!

   In Unity and for the sake of the of the United Front--Paul

Paul, you can't take the good and leave  the bad.  If you ignore the "bad" 
experiences then you have nothing to grow from.  You need to learn from 
mistakes that are made and you need to stop and listen to what everyone is 
saying.  You have to watch what everyone is saying and doing especially 
from the internal side, you don't want half the people saying "We're 
running for 3 seats on city council" and then you have the rest going 
around yelling "Down with Cahill, Come Join the Anti-Cahill Revolution"

Contradictions will get the campaign nowhere...

Thats the thing.

Subject:Re: [nbp] Hi -- request for information.
Message:

Friends,

    Some of the trouble comes from the fact that we lack the necessary
information when
we hit the streets.  I'd like to be so bold as to request an outline of what
we should try to
cover when canvassing.  In my opinion, everyone involved in the canvas needs
to be hitting
the same basic points: advertising the platform and the candidates.  It
should be easier now
that we have a platform flyer to refer to, however, there needs to be some
sort of
canvassing primer.  A very simple, single page primer that could be given to
anyone who
has just joined on the campaign, and with which he or she could then go out
and feel
comfortable canvasing.  *Obviously* we would not want to follow it verbatim,
simply
to provide a basis for new members.

For example:
* Hi I'm from the people's campaign
* ask his/her opinion of the current government in New Brunswick?
* Explain the people's campaign
        political campaign to run 3 people against the current city machine
for council.
* overview of platform points, explain the platform was voted on, result of
1000 surveys, etc
        hand them the flyer, ask questions, focus on things they are
interested in,
. . .

I think it would be incredibly useful.

In addition, I'd like to request information from Right to Know.  Lots of
it.  Chris has
offered to scan as much as possible and place it on the website.  All the
juicy dirt that's
been dug up needs to be kept together somewhere,  a nice big central
repository such
that when we are making flyers, papers, etc, we can just pull this
information out as needed.

Thoughts?

Thanks!
- Michael

Subject:URGENT - from the Steering Committee
Message:

URGENT MESSAGE FROM THE STEERING COMMITTEE:

On Friday May 19, the Steering Committee made the 
unfortunate discovery that one of the People�s Campaign 
candidates, Danny Rosado, is not eligible to run for the 
New Brunswick City Council. Danny was under the 
incorrect impression that she only needed to be a U.S. 
citizen by the time of the November elections. She filed 
her naturalization papers with the INS five months ago 
and will obtain her citizenship within weeks. However, 
election law requires her to be a citizen and a 
registered voter by June 6 in order to get on the 
ballot. 
In light of this critical situation, the Steering 
Committee held an emergency meeting on Friday night. The 
meeting included all 10 members of the Steering 
Committee: Danny Rosado, Curtis Warren, Keith Joseph, 
Xavier Hansen, Joe Smith, Diego Morales, Frank Bright, 
Janice Payce, Audrey Allred and Jose Solano (Janice and 
Curtis were attending a dinner with Al Sharpton and 
communicated with the rest of the Steering Committee by 
phone). Considering time constraints (petitions are due 
by June 6, in two weeks), the Steering Committee, as the 
elected leadership of the People�s Campaign, decided to 
select a third candidate for the City Council in 
accordance with the democratic decisions made by the 
residents of New Brunswick at the People�s Convention of 
May 13.
 The fourth top vote-getter in the elections for City 
Council candidates at the People�s Convention was Glen 
Fleming (41 votes). However, Glen has cut off all 
contacts with the People�s Campaign since he lost the 
nomination at the People�s Convention. We found out this 
past week that  he signed his name to get petitions from 
the County Clerk�s office in order to run for a New 
Brunswick City Council seat on his own in the November 
elections, thereby competing against the People�s 
Campaign. This is a direct violation of the oath he 
signed at the People�s Convention (reiterated in his 
concession speech) to support the decisions of the 
People�s Campaign. This violation disqualifies him from 
becoming our third candidate for the City Council.
The fifth top vote-getter was Diego Morales (20 votes). 
Following a discussion by all members of the Steering 
Committee, we unanimously decided to place Diego Morales 
as the third New Brunswick City Council candidate on the 
People�s Campaign ticket, along with Curtis Warren and 
Keith Joseph. Diego has been a U.S. citizen for eight 
years and is registered to vote according to the 
official list of voters of Middlesex County. Danny 
Rosado gave him an enthusiastic endorsement. 
Danny was nominated as the new president of the Latino 
Committee and will remain on the Steering Committee. 
Everyone present told Danny we count on her to run as a 
People�s Campaign candidate in the next citywide 
elections two years from now. Danny promised to continue 
to promote the important issues she spoke of at the 
People�s Convention, specifically the struggles of 
working women in New Brunswick. Since we have 
regrettably lost our only woman candidate, everyone in 
the People�s Campaign should try to contribute to this 
task.
	The new People�s Campaign ticket continues to 
represent our most important strength: the multi-
national unity of the Latino, Afro-American and Euro-
American communities in the people�s struggle for 
democracy. Still, we must get a lot more serious about 
our work, down to the last detail, to avoid making any 
more dangerous mistakes of this kind in the months to 
come. We have an immediate challenge at hand: WE NEED 
EVERYONE TO COME OUT TO GET SIGNATURES FOR THE 
CANDIDATES� PETITIONS THAT ARE DUE IN TWO WEEKS!!! 
Canvass teams meet EVERY WEEK DAY AT 6PM at the PUBLIC 
LIBRARY (Livingston Ave.),  1PM ON SATURDAY and 12 NOON 
ON SUNDAY. Beep Samantha Prince at 898-9534 if you can 
only go at a different time of the day. We cannot let 
down the people of New Brunswick who have given their 
whole-hearted support to the People�s Campaign. We must 
show a lot of heart in the face of adversity if we want 
to defeat the City Machine in November. UNITE, ORGANIZE, 
SEIZE POWER!

CURTIS WARREN, KEITH JOSEPH AND DIEGO MORALES 
FOR THE NEW BRUNSWICK CITY COUNCIL IN NOVEMBER!

For the Steering Committee,

Xavier Hansen
Campaign Manager

    I'd like to thank you, and everyone else on the Steering 
Committee for this *serious* overtime and high stress work.  

What happens to the petitions that have already been 
signed for the candidates?  
Do those signatures need to be re-obtained?

    I have already updated the candidate flyer on the web

As a former canvass director, this is critical element that should be worked 
out.  The outline here looks good.  I'm sure some committee will address it.  
One question I did have is will voter registration be included with 
canvassing?  Can it be included?  I've never coordinated a voter registration 
drive so I'm not sure if there are issues I'm missing here, but this sounds 
like a great opportunity for the level of canvassing that this campaign can 
generate.

Great work to everyone in the Steering Committee! It's highly unfortunate
that we must lose Danny as a candidate, but Diego is a wonderful new
candidate, and it's excellent that Danny will remain on the Steering
Committee as the Latino Committee's president and representative. You all
had to make hard decisions and deal with the situation presented to you,
and you did a wonderful job. I'm glad we elected all of you, and I think
this really proves the strength of this Campaign and of the
representatives elected by the people of New Brunswick. Thank you all.

Message:

There will be a planning board meeting this Wednesday at 7:30 in CIty Hall.

Heldrich Plaza is up for approval. This is a 15 story building with luxury apts, hotel/convention center, private healthclub and pool, 300 car parking.  They will also be dealing with the Antioch Community Development Corp and an amendment to the zoning ordinance for R-5 districts (residential) regarding requiring adequate parking circulation.

It would be great to have people at this meeting to register concern about the development.  If someone has time to review the plans in the office that would be good too - generally approval is conditional upon meeting specific requirements of zoning - in this case, the downtown redevelopment district.  I can never get to the office so that is a problem.  IF we decide it is wise we may be able to tie up the project after the fact.  Anyway, I think the word is we dont want to wage a specific campaign around this now, as this would divert energies from the general campaign.

Let me know if you or anyone can get the downtown redevelopment plan fromthe office tomorrow and review the plans to determine accordance.  I already have the master plan and general zoning ordinance.

Thank you.

 ------------------ 
Our friends across the Atlantic have sent this out.  Sorry for
cross-postin=
g.  As you know, the IMF and World Bank will meet again in Prague
in =
September.  Contact info below.
______________________________________________________
Already, many groups around the world are preparing for this
event, in
recognition that the capitalist system, based on the exploitation
of
people, societies and the environment for the profit of a few,
is the
prime cause of our social and ecological troubles.

September 26-28 the IMF and World Bank are holding their 55th
annual
summit in Prague. A mass mobilisation of people to Prague is
beginning. On
September 26 peoples of the world will express their opposition
to the
World Bank and the IMF and their policies. Peoples of the world
will join
together in an expression of solidarity with the demonstrators
in Prague.

European grassroots groups have met recently and are planning
a European
wide mobilisation to Prague and also decentraslised action. The
idea has
been discussed and supported by several Latin American movements
which met
in Nicaragua recently. The Indian 'National Alliance of People's
Movements' issued a statement, just before the A16 protests in
Washington,
which you can read here. More messages from round the world are
on the
Calls to Action page.

The September 26 Global Day of Action proceeds from the successes
of the
previous global Days of Action against Capitalism on June 18
and November
30 of last year and May 1 of this year. S26 expands on these
previous Days
in the same spirit. Through those Days our networks grew, we
learned much,
and we saw many new people engage themselves. September 26 will
continue
this process of building up a strong, bold, and creative grassroots
movement for a society in which people do not exploit or oppress
each
other, communities or the environment, but one that is based
on
solidarity, co-operation, grassroots democracy, and ecological
sustainability.

As on previous occasions, people of different movements and different
countries will join forces on this day against the social, political,
and
economic institutions of the capitalist system - in particular
against the
World Bank and the IMF.

Workers, the unemployed, students, trade unionists, peasants,
the
landless, fishers, women groups, ethnic minorities, indigenous
peoples,
peace activists, environmental activists, ecologists, and so
on will work
in solidarity with one another in the understanding that their
various
struggles are not isolated from each other. The simultaneous
occupation
and transformation of the capitalist social order around the
globe - in
the streets, neighbourhoods, fields, factories, offices, commercial
centres, financial districts, and so on - will strengthen mutual
bonds at
the local, national, and international levels.

As before, the day will be organised in a non-hierarchical way,
as a
decentralised and informal network of grassroots groups that
employ
non-authoritarian, grassroots democratic forms of organisation,
struggle
independent of the social, political, and economic institutions
of the
capitalist system, and seek to effect change directly through
their own
action. Each event or action will be organised autonomously by
each group,
while coalitions of various movements and groups can be formed
at the
local, regional, and national levels. A strategy that may be
useful at the
local level is that various groups co-operate in creating a surrounding
atmosphere of carnival and festivity as a setting for their various
actions.

Examples of conceivable actions are: strikes - demonstrations
- critical
mass bike rides - carnivals - street parties - reclaiming streets,
government land or office buildings for non commercial and good
activities
- marches - music - dancing - speeches - handing out flyers -
banner
hangings - distributing community controlled newspapers - street
theatre -
building gardens - handing out free food - mock trade fairs -
offering no
interest loans outside major banks - solidarity actions - pickets
-
occupations of offices - blockades and shutdowns - appropriating
and
disposing of luxury consumer goods - sabotaging, wrecking, or
interfering
with capitalist infrastructure - appropriating capitalist wealth
and
returning it to the working people - declaring oneself independent
from
capitalism and authoritarian governments - setting up grassroots'
community councils and holding meetings outside city halls -
setting up
economic alternatives, like workers' co-operatives - promoting
economic
alternatives to capitalist companies - promoting grassroots based
forms of
community organisation - etc.

If you or your group plan to join this day of action, please
let others
know as soon as possible, to facilitate networking and communication.
There are several international mailing lists available for open
discussions and co-ordination (see resources).

A public international contacts list is regularly posted to them
in order
to facilitate decentralized and non-hierarchic networking. To
have your
contact information added to it, please contact resistance@...,
indicating (a) the country and location in which you plan to
take action,
plus any other information you see fit, for instance (b) the
name of your
group, coalition or yourself, (c) the events or actions being
planned, (d)
your land address, (e) email address, (f) telephone number, (g)
fax number
or (h) web site.

There are many things we need to do, to make the best of September
26 at
the global, local, and national levels. We need to spread information
about it among as many suitable groups and movements as possible.
We need
to spread and share propaganda materials, such as leaflets and
posters.
And, in general, we need to share our experiences, thoughts and
ideas with
one other and help each other out. At the local level, information
about
the day needs to be spread and discussed among groups and individuals,
meetings need to be organised, events planned, leaflets printed
and
distributed, funds raised, laughter and conversation shared.

The process of building up our movements can and should be continued
through further global days of action against capitalism in the
future.

Any "enquiries" or concerns about the September 26 global day
of action
should be directed to other activists in the group, city, country
or on
the various mailing lists, for us to mutually help each other
with ideas
and advise. There is no-one in charge or pulling the strings
for the day.
It will be a radically decentralised and non-hierarchic event
entirely of
our own creation in co-operation and solidarity with one another.

NEEDED: Translators !!! To make S26 information available in
every
language, especially Spanish, French, German, Russian, Arabic,
Dutch, and
Chinese.

Jeb and George Bush to the Death! Tomorrow
Night (Wed.) on "The Awful Truth"

May 23, 2000

Dear Friends,

Yesterday, the Los Angeles Times, in
reviewing an advance screening of tomorrow
night's episode, called "The Awful Truth" the
"smartest, funniest, most subversive satire on
TV."

Tomorrow night (Wednesday, May 24), if you
tune in to our show, "The Awful Truth," on
Bravo, here is what you'll see:

-- The "African American Wallet Exchange
Program," wherein I take a trip to Harlem to
distribute Day-Glo Orange wallets so that the
police will no longer mistake a black man's
wallet for a gun. Last year, the police fired 41
bullets and killed a man named Amadou
Diallo -- whose only crime was that he was
holding his wallet. This is one of many such
incidents around the country where unarmed
black citizens have been killed because the
cops thought they "saw something."

-- The Sibling Rivalry of the Century! Gov. Jeb
Bush vs. Gov. George W. Bush in a race to the
death! Death PENALTY, that is. On tomorrow
night's show, we send our cheering section to
"support" the Bush brothers as they each try
to outdo each other in executing more
prisoners. We've got marching bands,
cheerleaders, big scoreboards, and lots of
fans who show up at actual executions in
Texas and Florida to root-root-root for the
home team! If this all seems a little dark and
twisted, well, that's why we're on at 10pm!

-- Throughout the show tomorrow, it's
"Compassionate Conservative Night," where
we'll have actual Wall Street bankers and
investors, most of whom are worth millions,
participating in a number of REAL events, such
as "Dunk the Homeless," "Pie the Poor," and
"Pin the Tail on the Illegal Alien." Did I say
the Death Penalty piece was out there? Whoa,
wait 'til you see this!

The NRA held their convention over the
weekend and a bunch of gun-nuts have
started a letter writing campaign against the
show! Thank you, Moses! Ol' Charlton Heston
holding up that rifle and screaming his head
off on Saturday was priceless. But their
announcement that they were going to invade
Times Square and open up a theme store and
restaurant -- well, thems fightin' words! Trust
me, they will rue the day they invade our set!
Pistol Pete will not be packing!

So, don't forget to tune in this Wednesday
night (tomorrow), on Bravo, at the following
times:
   10pm and 1am        Eastern
   9pm and Midnight    Central
   8pm and 11pm        Mountain
   7pm and 10pm        Pacific

(And in the U.K., we're on tonight -- Tues. --
in the 11pm hour on Channel 4)

Thanks again, and let me know what you
think.

Go Lethal Injection!

Go Electric Chair!

Go you Bloody Bushes!!

Yours, Michael Moore

Subject:FROM THE STEERING COMMITTEE
Message:

The following resolution was approved 6-0 at the 
Steering Committee meeting of 5/29/2000. In attendance 
were Danny Rosado, Janice Payce, Keith Joseph, Audrey 
Allred, Frank Bright & Xavier Hansen. Joe Smith was also 
present but he left the meeting before the vote was 
taken.

************

Our historic first People�s Convention of New Brunswick 
brought together representatives from all communities 
and classes willing to struggle for democracy. We 
unanimously adopted our program and elected three 
candidates with clear majorities who will run in the 
elections to the City Council on November 7. This great 
success has given new energy to the People�s Campaign. 
We have already more than 60 active volunteers and we 
are growing every day. United, we can win.
Unfortunately, four individuals in the People�s 
Campaign, from the group Block on Lock, are currently 
distributing a letter that viciously attacks one of our 
candidates, Curtis Warren Sr. This letter slanders 
Curtis by claiming that he fails to support the People�s 
Campaign program and wants to cut a deal with the City 
Machine. Block on Lock bases this ridiculous insult on a 
single article in the Home News Tribune in which a 
reporter quoted Curtis at the Convention saying he was 
not going "to tear down the political machine" and that 
he would work with pharmaceutical companies to "solve 
the city�s drug problem" (see Home News Tribune, Sunday 
May 14, Local Section). 
The Home News Tribune is a big business newspaper tied 
to the corrupt New Brunswick City Machine No one in 
their right mind should expect them to report truthfully 
on the People�s Campaign. This is why we print our own 
newspaper to make sure we bring the real campaign news 
to the people. And this why we must prepare our 
candidates to make short and clear statements promoting 
the program of the People�s Campaign when dealing with 
other reporters. Because we had so much work to get 
ready for the convention, we did not prepare our 
candidates to deal with the press that day. Curtis spoke 
to the reporter for over ten minutes about the People�s 
Campaign. The Home News Tribune editors printed only two 
sentences to represent their views, not ours. 
Block on Lock never called Curtis to raise their 
concerns about his quotes. They never considered the 
four years Curtis has dedicated in the struggle against 
police brutality in New Brunswick and the many public 
speeches he has made to promote the struggle for 
democracy and to oppose the corrupt City Machine. And 
they never considered the respect Curtis has earned in 
all of New Brunswick�s communities for his courage and 
integrity, which is why he received the most votes of 
any candidates at the People�s Convention. The letter 
Block on Lock is distributing is really an attempt to 
demoralize and disrupt the campaign at a time when 
everyone is working their hardest to gather hundreds of 
petition signatures in only two weeks to put our 
candidates on the ballot. It is an attempt to sabotage 
the campaign by trying to weaken us and to strengthen 
our opponents.
The People�s Campaign is based on a broad unity around 
our program and our candidates, democratically voted on 
at the People�s Convention. Everyone has the right 
distribute their own flyers as long as they do not go 
against the unity of the People�s Campaign. Anyone who 
wants to attack the People�s Campaign by insulting and 
slandering one of our candidates must do so from outside 
the campaign. I propose to the Steering Committee that 
all those who signed the Block on Lock letter be 
immediately suspended from all campaign activities. They 
should not be allowed back into the campaign unless they 
renounce their letter openly. This is not an easy 
decision for us to make since we work so hard to keep 
everyone united in the campaign. But we cannot let down 
the people of New Brunswick and allow the whole campaign 
to be divided and defeated because we are afraid to make 
hard choices. And we cannot win our struggle for 
democracy if we allow anyone to stab us in the back when 
we must all stand shoulder to shoulder on the front line.

Xavier Hansen
Campaign Manager
5/29/2000

***************************************

The Steering Committee suspended Cliff Smith, Joe Smith 
and Jayson Hawkins from all campaign activities. They 
may return to the campaign should they decide to 
renounce their slanderous letter in writing. 

Keith Joseph is writing a response to the Block on Lock 
letter on behalf of the People's Campaign. Copies of 
both letters will be available at the next General 
Meeting on June 17.

Two proposals to form additional caucuses were brought 
to the Steering Committee meeting of 5/29/2000.

Nikki Engel proposes the formation of a Women's Caucus 
in the People's Campaign. The Steering Committee 
supports this proposal and recommends that the caucus be 
organized at the next General Meeting on June 17.

Kevin proposes the formation of a Youth Caucus in the 
People's Campaign. The Steering Committee supports this 
proposal as well and recommends that Outreach Chair 
Samantha Prince assist all interested youth in forming 
this caucus.  

Janice Payce and Curtis Warren have also begun 
organizing to form a Black Caucus in the People's 
Campaign. And of course, a Latino Caucus (Comite Latino) 
was formed at the People's Convention and held its first 
preparatory meeting last week with 12 participants.

The Steering Committee, by a vote of 6-0, passed the 
following guidelines for the caucuses in order to assure 
fair representation to all in the People's Campaign:

Any caucus that recruits 10 or more active organizers to 
its meetings may elect a representative to the Steering 
Committee.

In unity, 

Xavier Hansen
Campaign Manager

Subject:School Ethics Commission Decision re Arocho of N.B. Board of Education
Message:

My complaint against New Brunswick Board of Education
member Martin Arocho has been substantiated. He has
been found to have broken state ethics law known as
the School Ethics Act. In its May 23rd meeting the New
Jersey School Ethics Commission found his employment
with the Puerto Rican Action Board and his vote to
award that organization a $415,000 contract a
violation of Section 24(c). The Commission's
recommendation of censure as a penalty will be
reviewed by the state Education Commissioner. After
this, this matter may be concluded. If not, the case
is then appealed to the State Board of Education.

The case will be available for viewing at the state
Department of Education's website under the School
Ethics Commission link. You will need Adobe Acrobat to
view the document.

For those who have helped and offered encouragement,
thank you, thank you!

La lucha continua...

FROM THE 6/1/00 STAR_LEDGER:

School official faces censure 

                By Alexander Lane
                STAFF WRITER

                The state School Ethics Commission has recommended
that New Brunswick school board President Martin Arocho be formally
censured for crossing an ethical line. 

                Arocho should have abstained from a 1998 board
vote to award a $415,583 contract for preschool services to the
nonprofit Puerto Rican Action Board, for which Arocho works,
the commission ruled. 

                Arocho's employment at Puerto Rican Action Board
"might reasonably be expected to impair his objectivity," the
decision read. 

                Commissioner of Education David Hespe will now
decide whether to formally censure Arocho. Generally, the commissioner
follows the ethics commission's
suggestions. 

                Brian Villa, the activist who filed the complaint
against Arocho, called the decision a victory. 

                "The complaint was substantiated and he was found
to have violated the law, that's the bottom line," Villa said.
"This is also a message that thoughtful committed citizens can
impose moral and ethical standards on board members who often
flout the public's wishes." 

                Arocho was not reachable, but Superintendent
of Schools Ronald Larkin lauded the decision. 

                "I'm very happy with the censure, it basically
validates that there was no wrongdoing," Larkin said. "They had
to give him something and that was the least severe." 

                Larkin pointed out that the contract would have
passed easily had Arocho abstained, and Arocho's voting was just
an oversight. "It wasn't done with any favor or anything of that
nature," Larkin said. 

                Villa has long said the school board should be
democratically elected rather than appointed by the mayor. He
has a reputation for keeping a close eye on the board -- but
this is his first successful ethics complaint. 

                "I touched the Blarney stone and they said that
I would never do it," Villa said. "I won on the merits." 


FROM THE 6/1/00 HOME NEWS TRIBUNE:

NEW BRUNSWICK: State panel rules school board head broke law


VOTE INVOLVED EMPLOYER 

By JAKE STUIVER

           New Brunswick board of education President Martin
Arocho violated state law when he voted in favor of awarding
a contract to his employer, the Puerto Rican Action Board, the
state School Ethics Commission has ruled.

           The commission, which operates under the state Department
of Education, found May 23 that Arocho violated the School Ethics
Act. The commission recommended a penalty of censure.

           Arocho could not be reached for comment yesterday
evening. He became president of the board earlier this year.

           New Brunswick activist Brian Villa filed a complaint
against Arocho and board member Edwin Guiterrez
last year for voting on a July 1998 resolution awarding a $415,583
contract to the nonprofit PRAB to provide preschool for city
4-year-olds.

           Villa said the two board members should have abstained
from the vote because they were both listed as
members of PRAB in a board flier and because Arocho worked for
PRAB. He also challenged Guiterrez's appointment to the board
by Mayor Jim Cahill because he is a city employee working in
the Community Development Division.

           The commission dismissed the complaints against Guiterrez,
finding that Guiterrez's employment with the city
does not constitute a substantial conflict and that Guiterrez
was not a member of PRAB at the time of the
vote in 1998. Guiterrez was a founding member of PRAB in 1971
and served on the group's board of trustees until 1991.

           The commission found that Arocho also was not a member
of PRAB at the time of the vote, but he was an
employee of the organization and therefore violated a statute
that prohibits school officials from acting on
any matter in which they or an immediate family member has a
direct financial involvement.

           At the time, Board Attorney George Hendricks said
that if he knew Arocho was a PRAB employee when the vote was
taken, he would have advised him to abstain. According to the
state document detailing the finding, Hendricks also argued the
board first contracted with PRAB in July 1993, prior to Arocho's
employment with the organization in 1997.

           Hendricks also argued Arocho had been hired by PRAB
under a state Department of Community Affairs grant in 1997,
and that his job had nothing to do with PRAB's preschool program,
according to the document.

           Villa said he's satisfied with the judgment.

           "A lot of unnecessary things were said about my claim,
and those things turned out to be false," he said.

Bus will leave New Brunswick at 9:00 am, returning at 7pm.

Please contact me for tickets, or more information. This ought to be a good

This presents an opportunity to present efforts for good government,
accountability and open books at the next city council meeting.

**********
STAR-LEDGER
Lawyer accused of raiding account 

             06/01/00

             By Alexander Lane
             STAFF WRITER

             One of New Brunswick's part- time city
             prosecutors is facing state disciplinary action
for allegedly writing himself a $5,000 check from a
             client's escrow account to buy Christmas
             presents. 

             If the state Office of Attorney Ethics proves that
             charge against attorney Frank Shamy at a June
             15 hearing, it is likely Shamy will be disbarred,
             said Lee Gronikowski, deputy ethics counsel at
             the state agency. 

             ''If you do it, you go. There's not a lot of talk
about
             mitigation, extenuation, aggravation,"
             Gronikowski said. 

             The misappropriation charge is the most serious
             of three contained in an April 6 complaint
             Gronikowski lodged against Shamy after the
             agency did a random audit of financial records for
             Shamy's private law practice. 

             The agency -- an arm of the state Supreme Court
             -- also charged that Shamy misrepresented the
             status of a real estate transaction and committed
             record keeping violations. 

             In a written response to the complaint, Shamy
             said he borrowed the $5,000, but said he had his
             client's permission to do so. He denied
             intentionally lying about the real estate
             transaction, and said he corrected the
             record-keeping mistakes. 

             Shamy, at first, denied knowing anything about
             the complaint and then said he would not talk in
             detail about it. "This has nothing to do with my
job
             as prosecutor," Shamy said. 

             According to his written response, Shamy said he
             had his client's verbal permission to use the
             $5,000. 

             ''Respondent (Shamy) was unaware that this
             transaction had to be reduced to writing and
             certainly would have obtained his client's written
             consent had he known that was required," the
             response reads. 

             Shamy's attorney in the matter is E. Ronald
             Wright, a part-time New Brunswick municipal
             judge. Attempts to reach Wright were
             unsuccessful. 

             Shamy started working as a part- time prosecutor
             last June 26 and is paid a base salary of
             $18,000. 

             New Brunswick Mayor James Cahill did not return
             a call for comment about the matter and the city's
             attorney William Hamilton, who appointed Shamy,
             said he learned of the complaint only yesterday
             morning. 

             Hamilton said he was gathering all the relevant
             documents to prepare a report for the mayor. 

             The misappropriation complaint is related to a
             personal injury lawsuit Shamy filed in 1994 as a
             private attorney on behalf of John Ludlow. In
             1997, $125,000 in settlement funds was
             deposited into Shamy's attorney trust account. 

             The Middlesex County Board of Social Services
             then put a lien on Ludlow's settlement, entitling
the
             board to reclaim welfare money it had paid
             Ludlow. 

             On Dec. 1, 1998 -- with $6,747 in Shamy's trust
             account to pay the social services board --
             Shamy wrote himself the $5,000 check to pay for
             Christmas presents, the attorney ethics complaint
             says. 

             Shamy has denied his behavior was egregious
             enough to violate the Wilson Rule, based on a
             1971 state Supreme Court decision, that
             specifically prohibits attorneys from misusing
             clients' money. 

             ''It basically says 'Thou shalt not steal,'"
             Gronikowski said. 

             The complaint also alleges Shamy told the Smart
             Money Mortgage Center he was holding an
             $8,000 gift for Juan and Beatriz Marrero, whom
             he was representing in a real estate purchase. In
             fact, according to the complaint, he was holding
             no gifts for the Marreros, just a $20,000 loan from
             Juan Marrero's trade union. 

             Shamy said in his response that another attorney,
             James Feeney, was holding the gift, and what
             mattered most was that the $8,000 existed, not
             who was holding it. 

             The Office of Attorney Ethics has 15 three-person
             county committees that decide their cases. The
             Mercer County ethics committee, made up of two
             lawyers and one nonlawyer, will meet publicly to
             hear Shamy's case at a Princeton law office on
             June 15.

the Board of Elections on June 1.

NEW BRUNSWICK PEOPLES' CAMPAIGN
C/O FRANK BRIGHT
218 GEORGE STREET
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ 08901

June 1, 2000

Matthew M. Vaughn
Middlesex County Board of Elections
777 Jersey Avenue
New Brunswick, NJ 08901

Dear Mr. Vaughn:

	I have your letter of May 10, 2000.  Because it utterly
avoided the issues we raised in our letter of April 7, 2000, in which
we petitioned the Board of Elections to override the city-recommended
sites for twelve polling districts in New Brunswick, I will not
dignify your letter by calling it a "response" to mine.

	Your letter contends, and indeed, we concede, that the
decennial census precludes meaningful changes to ward and district
lines this year.  N.J.S.A. 19:4-15.  However, those same election
statutes are equally clear that the selection of polling places is a
separate issue.  Selecting sites for polls is an annual exercise that
must be undertaken regardless of when the Census is taken.  N.J.S.A.
19:8-2 directs municipal clerks to suggest, and the County Board to
select, at specified deadlines in each year, polling places for
elections.  Your suggestion that the taking of the Census precludes
the Board from fulfilling its specific statutory mandate of annually
selecting appropriate polling places calculated to ease all possible
burdens on voting, is absurd.

	The Board's refusal to even consider changes in the location
of the polling places on a wholly unfounded legal rationale  the
taking of the Census this year  is itself arbitrary and
capricious,
and an abuse of the Board's discretion.  Turning to the merits,
we
convincingly demonstrated in our April 7, 2000 letter that the
current polling locations for twelve districts in New Brunswick are
inadequate.  There is no competent evidence known to us, or that has
been presented to the Board, that contradicts the polling places we
recommended, or our rationales supporting each such change.  Again,
the refusal to implement our recommendations is arbitrary,
capricious, and an abuse of discretion.

	Accordingly, we urge the Board to reconsider its decision.
If we do not hear from you by Monday, June 12, 2000, we will have no
choice but to ask a court to set aside these acts and omissions by
the County Board and implement the uncontradicted recommendations of
the Peoples' Campaign as to polling places.

	Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Respectfully submitted,

NEW BRUNSWICK

Subject:Election activities tonight
Message:

Members of the Peoples' Campaign will be meeting at 6 pm _SHARP_ 
tonight at 218 Townsend for the purpose of visiting several polling 
places.  This learning exercise is important.  It meant to 
familiarize people with poll sites, new voting machines, and election 
day procedures.  Anyone who will be working on the campaign in ANY 
capacity in November, and anyone who can teach those that will be 
around in November is strongly encouraged to attend, so you can see 
exactly how things are done now, and it is not an entirely new 
experience in November.


Here is the agenda (subject to change)

6:10 Leave 218 Townsend, travel to Redshaw School

6:20 Arrive Redshaw School, meet district board workers, examine 
voting machines, get explanation of how they work, meet challengers, 
examine voting roll books, voting slips, and provisional ballots.

6:50 Exit Redshaw school, scope out 100-foot border from polling 
site, meet any GOTV workers on site.

7:00 Leave for Providence Square poll, where we will go in, look 
around, study surroundings, demarcate 100-foot line, and leave.

7:20 Arrive at Lincoln School

7:30 Study layout of poll site, meet district board workers

7:45 Role-play advising voter of which polling district to go to.

7:55 Talk to campaign / GOTV workers

8:00 Polls close, see how voting results are collected from machines

8:20 Leave for Corzine party at Hyatt.

Hi everyone

The campaign seems to be going well. I know everyone is working hard and it 
shows.

I just wanted to let people know that in the program that we made 2000 
copies of, the amendments from the convention did not get in. The platform 
therefore doesn't represent the decisions made there. I did not look over 
the entire thing, but in the case of our position on childcare, it left us 
with a very bad public position and not the one decided by the majority in 
the campaign. The pamphlet otherwise looks great, and it is a powerful piece 
of literature to have.

I just want to make sure that no more of this flyer gets made without the 
updates put in and that it is changed before the newspaper comes out.

In Unity,
Louise

Message:

A proposal was brought to the Steering Committee meeting on 5/29/00 to make 
all phone and contact lists collected while canvassing available to everyone 
working on the campaign.

The Steering Committee decided against this proposal for these reasons:
1) Due to the large amount of contact information that has been collected, 
it is virtually impossible to compile a complete list.

2) Having a list of numbers available to all campaign organizers would ruin 
the efficiency of the campaign. If people are receiving a potentially large 
amount of phone calls for various different reasons, they may get confused, 
irritated and discouraged from supporting and working with the campaign.

Instead, every organizer should keep a list of their own contacts and 
develop networks based on that information.

In unity,
Audrey Allred
Steering Committee

Hi there,

the amendments I introduced for the "jobs" portion of the platform (which 
were then accepted by majority vote at the convention) were not included in 
the pamphlet either. i introduced language on having the city favor 
unionized employers, and having it actively support unionization, and other 
language as well. i thought someone was recording these points??

These are the amendments made at the convention that we discussed adding to the new pamphlet - these are what I could remember from that day:

1. New Brunswick is a union friendly town, under jobs.
2. Establish a city-run employment center, under jobs.
3. Eliminate red tape and favoritism in the approval and permitting process, under redevelopment.
4. Increase investment in job training so all residents have access to better paying jobs in and outside of New Brunswick., under jobs

5 Childcare amendment: as she points out, Louise put a change forth at a general meeting month(s) before the convention that was approved.  This did not get written into the convention program.

Subject:People's Campaign
Message:

Submitted to NBPeople's Campaign Steering Committee By Joe Smith May 22.

As uniting basis of our campaign, we are agreed to uphold and fight for the 
Platform of Community Control as determined thru results of our door-to-door 
survey.

In our '00  election year strategy, we have agreed to challenge for City 
Council. As against a Political Machine that has, for decades, defeated 
every opposition it has faced. Rather it has expanded to send Machine 
Boss/Former Mayor/Cahill Uncle-John Lynch to the New Jersey Senate where he 
rose to Senate President under the Democratic Florio Administration- the 2nd 
Ranking Democrat in New Jersey.

Parallel Opportunist Sucker Soaries of New Brunswick/Franklin 1st Baptist 
Church turned Whore after the 1991 N.B. Police Murder of resident Shawn 
Potts. "Keeper of the Shawn Potts tree" Soaries parlayed his hustle into 
Nazi Whitman's administration where he's now N.J. Secretary of State, to 
smooth tension from Jack Booted State Police Storm Trooper "Profiling" "Drug 
War" Aggression.

This Political Machine crafted with the best Urban Development 
Strategists/FBI/COINTELPRO methods/experience that Johnson & Johnson's $25 
Billion Annual Revenue International Network can impose. As was put to me 
"We are against a juggernaut."

Can there be any question whatever that our People's Platform for Community 
Control is in complete contradiction to J&J, etc.'s imperialist murderous 
stronghold which it maintains through an experienced, financed Political 
Machine. The same Political Machine that ran Amiri Baraka and others from 
the Rutgers Faculty, that Purged student activists, that drove Assata Shakur 
from the country. (Didn't Cahill molest Shakur when she was the only woman 
locked in the cellar of Middlesex County Courthouse?)

Can anyone who supports our Platform have any question that its victory 
depends entirely on the overthrow of Bosses Cahill & Lynch, of their 
appointments Beltranena and Larkin and the complete defeat of their 
Political Machine? But these questions exist inside our campaign and are the 
biggest danger to our victory.

More dangerous than Bright Frank McCarthy & Compassionate Conservatism, 
Narrow Jim Luceno's Armchair Revolutionaries, NJFO's Constant Sabotage of 
the Elected Board of Ed Campaign, more dangerous is a "People's Candidate" 
who "invents" issues that come more from Nancy Reagan than community 
responses to our survey (Where was "Drug Problem" in our top5? 10? 20?). 
Why? To "invent" Traitor Soaries' Solutions of Cooperating with J&J to solve 
them.(Who but J&J is the biggest drug producer &  distributor in New 
Brunswick?) (Nevermind the N.B. Police!!).

Our campaign calls or organize the people to Seize Power! to solve our own 
problems as we see them.

Curtis Warren, who suddenly announces himself not as Bus Driver, Janitor, 
Maintenance, Handyman, Laborer, etc., but Security for snake Soaries' 1st 
Bobo Church, and Missionary of God-minutes after accepting his candidacy as 
People's Representative, hedges his bet. Professing Unite, Organize, Seize 
Power! to the Convention, Curtis "Say Sellout" Warren switched over bleating 
to the Home News "But we're not here to tear down the Political Machine, 
we're just here to do better."

Nope, Curtis can't get that. We want community control vs. Imperialism. Not 
Jr. Soaries's slick talk.

Confidence in Curtis? We got NADA. "First it is absolutely necessary that 
Revolutionaries and all Anti-imperialist, Radicals and Progressive people 
UNITE in an All People's UNITED FRONT AGAINST THE RIGHT WING & its' Klan 
Nazi Lynch mob Underground, as well as the Corporate Running Dof visible 
forces in Government, Politics, Wall Street Media, Academia, Institutions, 
Organizations!" (Amiri Baraka U&S April 2000)

You want it come get it. My dogs is with it.

Message:




1 JULY, 1991, AT 147 REDMOND ST., SHAUN, UNARMED, WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD 
BY NBPO ZANE GRAY.
GRAY, BACKED BY NB MAYOR JAMES CAHILL, NEVER FACED CHARGES.

ALL ARE INVITED TO COMMEMORATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF SHAUN "UNITY" 
POTTS.

WHEN: 1:OO PM, 1 JULY, 2000
WHERE: 147 REDMOND ST., NB.

Join us in a walking tour of the history of police brutality in Nu 
Brunzwick.

Saturday, 1 July, we honor the anniversary of the death of Shaun "Unity" 
Potts, at the hands of NB Police, and its cover-up by Mayor James Cahill and 
the County Prosecutor's Office.

We will begin 12:00 noon at the Commercial & Powers St. site of the NB 
Police murder of Carolyn "Sissy" Adams, and mark the route of the original 
"Justice for Unity" march.

Past Feaster Park, down Throop to 147 Redmond for a 1:00 pm commemoration of 
Potts, Adams, and all victims of NB & US police brutality.

Then up Remsen to Baldwin St. where officers Chinchilla and Marshall put a 
$10,000 bounty on the head of every Black man in the city, imposing gestapo 
rule that exists today.

Across Baldwin to Lee, where, days after Potts' murder, NB Police, 
encouraged by Mayor James Cahill, put K-9 attack dogs on Lester Voorhees.

We invite everyone to join this event and raise discussion of vital concerns 
such as:

What to do about police brutality?
What is the meaning of "Community Control Over Police"?
What side is the NB political machine on?
Who are our allies, Who are our enemies?
How did Buster Soaries parlay Potts' death into a position in Gov. Whitman's 
administration?
How should we approach the upcoming elections for NB City Council, NJ 
Senate, and US President?
How should we organize ourselves at a city, state, national, international 
level?

Build the Revolutionary Democratic Workers' Party
Build the United Front Against Imperialism

Message:

Is Communism divisive? or Who are the Peoples' Enemies?

Does the Peoples' Campaign Steering Committee stand with the attempts by 
Steering Committee member Frank Bright to slander Board of Education 
Campaign Coordinator Joe Smith, to sabotage the Campaign for an Elected 
Board of Education, and to subvert the democratic vote of the Peoples' 
Convention?

Bright, claiming to lead the democratic petty middle class of N.B., having 
lost his challenge to J. Smith's coordination of the Peoples' Campaign for 
an Elected Board of Education with his nomination of Jim Luceno (who 
succeeded in formalizing the internal opposition where NJFO failed in its 
nomination of Zofia Nowakowski) has switched in his accusing Smith of 
"divisiveness" to anti-democratic methods of advancing his position. Does 
Bright represent the Steering Committee in his attack on Joe?

The people of New Brunswick, understanding their condition, responded to our 
survey that the education system in New Brunswick was the most important 
issue in the city.

The Peoples' Convention, recognizing this mandate and recognizing Joe 
Smith's unquestionable production toward a democratic Peoples' Education 
System formalized Joe's leadership of this struggle placing him, as 
Coordinator, on the Strategic and Tactical Committees.

For Bright, after Joe's victory, to attack Joe as being "divisive to the 
campaign" not only slanders Joe and undermines the decision of the 
convention, but actually, from his position on the Steering Committee, 
attempts to provoke attacks on the Campaign and is himself being divisive.

To succeed, our platform must have the uncompromising support of the 
steering committee which demands that they address themselves to Bright's 
accusation.

No doubt the people's control over education divides most clearly the 
representatives of the people from the representatives of imperialism. To 
succeed, our campaign must establish which is which.

OVERTHROW CAHILL!
TEAR DOWN J&J'S POLITICAL MACHINE!

BEWARE THE PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN SELLOUT!

     Without doubt the world condition of the people vs. imperialism demands 
that we Seize Power! and take Community Control! as against the corporate 
dictatorship of international monopoly. This 6/10 of 1% (.006) of the 
population maintains rule thru its political machine apparatus globally and 
locally.

     From its New Brunswick World HQ, billion dollar Drug Kingpin J&J 
designs apartheid poverty from South Africa to George St.  As we build the 
revolutionary democratic movement against this Nazi World Order, we must 
immediately overthrow its local agents and TEAR DOWN ITS NATIVE POLITICAL 
MACHINE! Cahill/Lynch, puppet city council, appointed police director 
Beltranena, appointed Board of Education and superintendent Larkin must be 
put out and their apparatus demolished. This is the meaning of the People's 
Call "Community Control!", claimed by the "People's Campaign", and also the 
minimum, democratic level of revolutionary politics.

     But as we Overthrow Cahill & co., what is to be made of "People's 
Candidate" Curtis Warren's pitch to co-operate with J&J and join its 
political machine? And "People's Campaign" manager Xavier Hansen's sorry 
damage control talk of "front line"(!)"unity" with the political machine 
from the treacherous trenches of Highland Park?

     No, we must shadow these petty pretenders and expose their opportunist 
positions. Warren, Hansen, and "People's Campaign" Steering Committee have 
violated the democratic Campaign slogans Community Control! Seize Power! Put 
People First! This is and insult and slander to everyone who answered our 
survey, a sabotage of our campaign, an attempt to demoralize and disrupt the 
New Brunswick People's Revolutionary Democratic Movement.

     More clear by the day that only working class, communist leadership can 
represent the whole people against imperialism. We play the hand before us 
and support all tendencies against J&J/Cahill,etc., but we build the 
Revolutionary Democratic Workers' Party toward People's Democracy, 
Socialism, Communism.

Seize City Council!
Win the Elected Board of Education!
All Eyes on "People's Campaign"!
Down with Imperialism!

This attack on the People's Campaign in New Brunswick is a frightening 
throwback to earlier issues of UNS. Meaning it's hard to read, it's 
extremely left wing and dogmatic and filled with slogans that don't mean 
anything. Who is revolutionary enough in your eyes to tear down the machine 
and demolish the apparatus? What are you basing your accusations on? What 
does the fact that X lives in Highland Park have to do with anything? This 
type of politicking is only going to isolate you further and further away 
from the revolutionary movement. I sincerely hope you don't intend to go 
door to door telling the people of New Brunswick how un-revolutionary the 
People's Campaign is. That's what the people you're so intent on demolishing 
and tearing down usually paid people to do in the past.

Message:

I think one important issue that is behind our difficulties is that we havent addressed an approach to maintaining candidate's accountability to the campaign.  This is a next step.  Creating a democratic  accountability structure has not been done before so we are starting from scratch.  We all have said that we dont want our candidates to sell out at any point, thinking of once they get in office, and those we chose we have firm belief in them that they wont.  Is this enough at this point?  What do we expect a call for accountability to look like as we move forward?  Do we demand/expect that people make this call in a general meeting?  If we demand unity in the campaign do we ask that we not make our inital call a public attack, but more low key so as not to detract from the campaign and only move into the public realm once it is certain that the differences are irreconcilable with the campaign points, or that somewhere a mistake was not made or someone was not intentionally misquoted with the thought to divide and conquer? At what point are  we a ball and chain around our  candidates legs and at what point are we keeping the campaign accountable?  And if we create an accountability procedure, how can we make sure that it is not a bureaucratic nightmare or a reliance on someone knowing someone else - because alot of people don't know the organizers in the campaign well.

Subject: 	Two Excellent Polls


Two excellent polls released last week reveal strong continuing public
concern over declining job quality in the U.S.  The first, released by the
National Alliance for Fair Employment, finds that two out of three Americans
consider it unfair when contingent workers are paid lower wages than
full-timers doing the same work at the same level. Six out of ten said they
were more likely to vote for a candidate who backs legislation to require
companies to pay part-time, contract or temporary employees the same rate of
pay and benefits as regular employees. See the poll at:

www.fairjobs.org/report/poll.php

The second, released by Jobs for the Future, finds that a whopping *94%* of
Americans agree that people who work full-time should be able to earn enough
to keep their families out of poverty (80% agree strongly). And 77% believe
that government should help people leaving welfare get good jobs that offer
opportunities for advancement and the chance to remain self-sufficient. Only
19% believe people should be moved into jobs as quickly as possible
regardless of the jobs' potential.  Asked how much a family of four needs to
"make ends meet," 69% said at least $35,000 a year -- more than twice the
federal poverty level for such a household! See this poll at:

Regarding: Block on Lock Expelled

Last nite, Tuesday 13th June, I (Nicole Engel) received a phone call from 
Xavier Hansen, saying that the steering committee had unanimously voted to 
expel Block on Lock Productions from the People's Campaign and that I should 
consider myself barred from all campaign activities.

I am requesting on behalf of Block on Lock, that the steering committee send 
us a written document stating their action and the basis for it.

Message:

This statement was drafted by myself,  the Steering Committee of the People's Campaign
voted unanimously to support the expulsion of Block on Lock.
About Block on Lock
or who is selling out?

For the first time in memory residents of New Brunswick have begun to organize and
mobilize to seize control of government and begin to take control over their lives.
We have built for the first time a multi-national united front of Afro-Americans,
Latinos, and Euro-Americans uniting workers, students, professionals and other
segments of the middle class into an organization.  The People's Campaign represents
the first serious threat to the unchallenged domination of the city machine and the
giant corporations that back it. At this historic moment, when the people of New
Brunswick have finally begun to stretch out their arms and flex their muscles after a
long sleep, Block on Lock Productions takes up the job of attacking the people's
organization.  Block on Lock has done the only thing the City Machine can not do to
us, Block on Lock has called the Campaign a "sellout".  The have done the only job
that Cahil and all the other puppets of Johnson and Johnson in city government could
not do. We do not know if Block on Lock has been paid for their efforts.
      Block on Lock  has begun distributing literature attacking the People's Campaign
in general and the steering committee, our campaign manger, and our candidates in
particular.  The People's Campaign upholds everyone participating in the campaign's
right to criticize, question and discuss actions of the Campaign. We can not tolerate
member organizations slandering and viciously attacking our campaign. For these
reasons all members of Block on Lock Productions should be immediately expelled from
our organization.

i think this is  a profound issue that the Campaign should highlight (ie. 
create a brochure, flier, whatever) and agitate against. maybe we could call 
a public forum and have our candidates give statements/speeches. i think we 
need to highlight our platform more strongly. doing this could provide a 
great basis of unity with local public school teachers, who understand that 
first the K and pre-K teachers get downsized (or transferred) and then it's 
1st and 2nd, etc. etc. Do we have any contacts at NJEA or whatever the 
teacher's union is?

As a campaign, i think we should start coming out with much more strength 
against privatization. this combines our anti-appointed BOE position with 
anti-privatization... can we request that a position statement be drawn up 
and voted on for saturday's general meeting? Karen, would you provide more 
info or maybe be willing to write something yourself?

More info regarding the K and Pre-K privatization issue:

The NB BOE is currently  filing suit against the state regarding their lack of supplemental funds for the rest of the district, related to the Abbott v. Burke funds the City is due.  There is an overcrowding problem since the City has not gotten its money - $8M alone in pre-K funds. More students must be enrolled b/c of A v B. Last year, 4 year olds were enrolled for 1/2 day (Abbott v Burke requires that 3 yrs on up be in all-day pre-K programs). Next year, the program must include 3 year olds, and 400 are registered.  The City was planning to lease space in trailers, buy properties buy the State has dragged their feet and prevented them from doing this. So privatization is a poor response to this overcrowding problem.  Certification for daycare centers providing daycare (HeadSart is just one provider) is being made more stringent and brought in line w/state standards, however, staff who were noncertified before receiving contracts have been grandfathered in.

just so you know, the city gave school space to the  Brunswick charter 
school instead of letting them find somewhere else to go (they are a 
regional charter school)even before they got there approval(!). The state is 
not wholly to blame. the city has not done enough to fight for this funding 
nor to use current funding to build space for these programs. They are very 
happy to instead pay private entities big money for the space.
furthermore we want standards above state standards, we want NAEYC (National

Here is a rough draft of the program. Please let me know if anyone has 
additions or changes.

Quality public childcare for all infants through pre-k children in New 
Brunswick. To ensure accountability and equity in the quality of the care, 
this should take place within public school system with union teachers 
certified in early childhood, age appropriate facilities, small class size 
and low teacher-student ratio.

Subject:Education, etc
Message:


Greetings --

I thought I would 'put down on paper' what I sought to express on 
Saturday, that is, my concerns over the "Higher Education" point of 
the platform as it is currently formulated, etc.. 

---

It is my understanding that the following was actually proposed and 
voted on as an integral component of the platform, at the convention:
             
             "College for all New Brunswick graduates"

Any further elaboration, in the form of specific policy 
recommendations and proposals, I understand need remain within the 
spirit of this (fairly general) point.  

Inside the current edition of the platform / candidates brochure, the 
following _specific_ policy recommendation appears, in attempted 
fulfillment of the above.  Verbatim --

"Negotiate with Rutgers University, as a condition any city 
assistance with plans for expansion, new buildings, or new programs 
in the city, to provide open admissions and free college education to 
all New Brunswick High School graduates."

I think the intentions here are quite good, and it isn't without 
merit to attempt to demand such an arrangement between Rutgers and 
the New Brunswick community. However, a number of problems arise.  At 
the same time, a number of considerations are omitted.   

1)  Rutgers is the 'State University of New Jersey'.  It is first and 
foremost accountable to the state legislature and the governor, 
alongside various corporate interests.  Secondly, only part of 
Rutgers College, Douglass College, and Mason Gross are actually in 
the City of New Brunswick.  The rest of it is in Piscataway, or in 
Newark or Camden.  

It would seem difficult for the City of New Brunswick to actually 
succeed in negotiating directly with the state university for such 
special consideration.  Would other cities and towns where Rutgers 
has campuses not demand the same arrangement?  This would have to 
become either a state policy, or no policy at all.  Of course, if the 
city council were to wish to put forward such a demand in a kind of 
activist role vis a vis the state or federal gov't -- there is 
nothing unusual about this -- it might be a good idea.  But the goal 
of the platform point seems to be something more concerete.

2)   It may be 'only fair' to extend open admissions selectively, to 
students from schools that perform so poorly that the state may well 
be obligated to give kids the benefit of the doubt, then compensate 
with remedial classes.  Rutgers is not that shy about lowering its 
admission standards for equality-of-opportunity considerations (as a 
state university).  What it fails at, like many large public 
universities undertaking this, is _retention_.  Open admissions won't 
guarantee that these NBHS graduates will go on to graduate from 
college.  This is perhaps more because of the "cultural capital" 
factor, knowing how to be a student, how to fake your way through 
certain things (like standardized tests), etc, than a lack of writing 
or math skills.  Or so I understand the consensus to be amongst many 
sociologists.

3)  The platform point above pays no attention to other state 
universities and colleges, vocational / technical / trade schools, 
and the county college.  Indeed, county colleges have a great deal of 
importance, if nothing else, in helping otherwise unprepared 
individuals to ultimately succeed in a four-year school.  (Also, MCC 
has a campus in New Brunswick)

So, what should be looked at more clearly is -- What opportunities 
_already_ exist, what community programs already exist, what are 
colleges in the state already doing, what scholarships exist, etc.. 
Furthermore, what sort of help are students recieving within the HS?  
Until these facts are known a little more clearly, it would probably 
be best to revise the platform to state something that includes more, 
but make less specific reccomendations.   

(Perhaps I am stating that the above proposal places the issue of 
higher education too much within the constellation of urban 
redevelopment issues rather than viewing it in terms of other 
educational and job-training/vocational issues)

This is all rudimentary, and issued with none but the most 
exploratory intent.  

Yours,

Jeremy

Message:

The City council is expected to take final action tonight on a $49M budget that calls for a 9-cent property tax rate increase.  The municipal tax levy will increase by $2.2M to $17.2 million necessitating a tax hike from $1.03 per $100 of assessed value tro $1.12 per $100.  The increase is due to several expenditures including spending $600K to lease a new police headquarters next to city hall in Civic Square, which wil lbe leased for 20 yrs from the county.  The council will also bove on the proposed budget of the City Market special improvement distric that covers the downtown area - at $401,990, $1,500 more than last year.  It will be supplemented by corporate sponsor financing (whatever that means!) of $106,000.  The council will also conduct a public hearing on a proposed zoning ordinance that would set 2 1/2 stories as the maximum height of new one and 2 family homes in the city. (if this went through the planning board, I missed it - they spoke about the extra bedroom regulations which I spoke out against but this was not explained to me.)

Great work!


NEW BRUNSWICK: Trailer plan for pupils protested


Published in the Home News Tribune 6/21/00
By JAKE STUIVER
STAFF WRITER
Parents, teacher's union leaders and political hopefules turned out en masse 
for a New Brunswick board of education meeting last night where the 
administration was expected to present a plan to house more prekindergarten 
pupils.

Representatives from the People's Campaign, an independent political group 
that's running candidates for City Council, were at the high school 
auditorium front door throughout the evening handing out fliers promoting an 
elected school board. City activists recently revived the campaign to wrest 
control of school board appointments from Mayor Jim Cahill and have a board 
elected by the public.

The school board went into closed session, upon which People's Campaign 
council candidate Curtis L. Warren Sr. went to the microphone and rallied 
the large crowd against the proposal to place prekindergarten and child-care 
programs in 26 temporary trailers and have a private company assist in their 
education.

Warren claimed the board would privatize the operation and undermine 
teacher's unions. His speech was followed by several women from the audience 
who spoke against the plan. One woman backed the call for an elected board.

The board was still in closed session at press time last night.

Schools Superintendent Ronald Larkin planned to present a temporary solution 
last night to an anticipated influx of pupils resulting from the state 
Deparment of Education's requirement to provide free prekindergarten and 
child-care programs to all residents.

New Brunswick doesn't have any more room to build facilities for a large 
enrollment increase, Larkin said Monday.

There are currently about 750 3-year-olds, 800 4-year-olds and 850 
kindergartners in the city's program, he said. Some of them are in schools 
and others are spread throughout various daycare facilities in the city, he 
said.

Under the temporary plan, there would be 26 trailers spread among the high 
school and Lord Stirling, McKinley and Woodrow Wilson schools, officials 
said.

The trailers and longer-term placements would come at no extra cost to 
taxpayers because they come with fees the district already pays for its 
child-care programs, Larkin said.

Kate M. Smith, president of the New Brunswick Education Association 
teacher's union, had a statement prepared to respond to the board's 
discussion last night.

In the statement, she complained that Innovative Educational Programs, the 
company that runs the city's science and technology high school, is proposed 
for taking over some of the child-care programs.

"It is a corporation," she said. "What does a corporation know about 
education? A corporation's reason for being is money, profit, not children's 
education."

The teachers provided by IEP would lack the benefits of the union contract 
or rights guaranteed to board employees under state law and wouldn't be able 
to get tenure or contribute to the pension fund, Smith said.

"Who, then, would be willing to work under such demeaning conditions?" she 
asked.

Larkin, interviewed prior to the meeting, insisted IEP is a reputable 
child-care provider with which the district has had a successful 
relationship at the science and technology high school.

Message:

this is my proposal to amend our campaign platform. i want to replace the 
current description underneath the "JOBS" subsection, which i believe is 
disjointed and unclear, with the following:

Our goal is full and meaningful employment at a living wage for all people 
in the city of new brunswick. To accomplish this, we will support/lead 
initiatives to raise the state minimum wage; we will actively support the 
right of all workers to organize for the purposes of collective bargaining; 
and we will give businesses that employ a majority city residents 
(especially those that are unionized) special preference in the procurement 
of city contracts. We support funding for job training for city residents 
(especially for women and youth). We actively oppose any efforts to 
privatize public sector work. We will strongly advocate for pay equity 
policies that can begin to lessen the disparity in wages between workers of 
different genders and nationalities.

any comments/questions? can we vote on this?

thanks, Kristina

Hey, it's that time of year....

######################################################################

                  ...PAUL'S BIRTHDAY PARTY...

######################################################################

WITH A TWIST!  WHAT?  I'll get to that.   Just come to my party at 8pm on 
July 7th at 559 Hamilton, Franklin; just across from Krauszer's.

But don't give me ANYTHING! I know, I probably didn't give you a damn thing 
for your birthday. Hell, I probably didn't even remember your birthday!

But I do want you to give a donation to the People's Campaign, so that my 
birthday party isn't just another party. What you get out of it is a good 
time, great conversation, meeting new people, some really good beer, some 
good food if you get there on time, and an overall sense that you're doing 
something for and with the people of New Brunswick...So come and give $5 (at 
least) and we'll all have a good time....call me at 732 729 0873 if you're 
confused.

Guys,

We need an update on what the Board of Ed proposal is to house the preschoolers.  I called and they told me today that the proposal does not (no longer?) include trailers/modulars.  If someone else can try and call- unfortunately I think my name is known too much by officials at this point.

jeremy,

i think you bring up excellent points. overall, considering the revisions 
that have been offered in the past week on some of the platform points, I 
think we've reached a point in the campaign when we have to move beyond the 
"sound bite" stage. that means researching our policy points and formulating 
clear and informed proposals. my suggestion to you is to reword the 
Education proposal to include what you've written. that way we can vote on 
it and continue transforming our platform for the better.

additionally, i want to reintroduce Zofia's idea that we assign "point 
people" to each topic on the platform. Experts, so to speak. i don't mean 
this to sound intimidating, but i think it would be easier if one or two 
people concentrated on one specific topic and made sure to research it 
thoroughly. that way, when the time comes, we can be prepared to talk about 
everything.

what do people think about this? i'd like to discuss this at the next 
tactical meeting if all are willing.

Kristina

Kris, I think you make good points. Let's get volunteers to contact outside 
experts, enlist them in the campaign's efforts (there have to be folks out 
there who would love to add some real policy juice to our work, get their 
names on the end product so to speak).  Point people shouldn't do all the 
work themselves. They should busy themselves getting NB residents to work 
with us. But point people would be responsible for gathering the info, 
cooking it down, and presenting it to either tactical or steering. They 
could also be the people who help prepare the candidates for the public, 
prep for debates, etc.

So far it seems they will up the class sizes, keep the 4-5 year olds kids in the classrooms in buildings.  They will likely subcontract out the 3 and 4 year olds.  However, the BOE is not giving out any info at this time and is in discussion with parents groups.

You can download all the latest flyers and posters from
there.  I'll be updating it periodically with Media's 
new work.  

Remember -- if you have criticisms of a piece, bring them
up within a week's time.  Otherwise they become old news
and our motivation to change them quickly will be ... well ...
less. :-)  

Once again, Media meets every Wednesday, 8pm, at 230 Sandford

you will also be put to work, so no complaining. ;-)

Hope everyone is well.

Folks, the newspaper is really looking sparse right now.  
It resembles a weak agitational pamphlet more than an
organ of Truth dissemination.  

I want everyone to look through the following two articles ...
and engage in Ruthless Criticism.  Remember -- this is the 
tool you will carry on the streets and give to anyone who is
interested in the Campaign.  It has to look sharp, it has to
represent the United Front, and it has to be true to our 
real intentions.

Nobody had a chance to criticize anything about the last
paper before it went to print.  I don't want that to happen
this time.  I want everybody's criticism.  Plus!  We need
everybody's contribution.  We are actually running short on
material for this paper.  So if anybody has information they
think should be in the paper, then please write an article
dealing with that specific issue.  (BOE, Redevelopment,
Police Brutality, Healthcare, children, etc.)The more specific 
information we can bring to the people, the better our chances of 
winning them over.

With that in mind, I want to push off the completion date of
this project from Tuesday to this weekend.  I'd rather have it a 
little later and better than sooner and shittier.  So let 'er rip.

Jim

Blurb on canvass: (Sam/Jim)

Volunteers for the People's Campaign collected 1000 surveys, in 
response to the question, "What do you believe is of greatest 
importance to the New Brunswick community?". This served as the basis 
for the following platform, openly debated and voted upon at the 
People's Convention this past May. These seventeen points form a 
spirited call for accountability and progressive reform. Since 
February members of the People's Campaign have canvassed the city, 
registering people to vote and getting signatures for an elected 
Board of Education.  We meet every day at the New Brunswick Public 
Library at 12 noon on Saturdays and Sundays and 6 PM during the 
week.  Come meet your neighbors and join the growing popular struggle 
for democracy!

Article on Convention: (Jim)

The New Brunswick Peoples Campaign held its history-making Convention 
on May 13th, 2000 at the Paul Robeson School, ratifying a platform 
and nominating three candidates for City Council.  Resulting from the 
many months of hard work by activists, residents, students, and 
community leaders, the Convention was a product of determination and 
dedication in the struggle for democracy.  
Uniting Democrats, Republicans, independents, revolutionaries, 
moderates, Blacks, Latinos, Whites, the young, and the old, it also 
represented the diverse array of groups in New Brunswick, coming 
together to take action against the corruption and gross injustices 
of the city machine.
The Convention was a product of the mass mobilization of the New 
Brunswick Peoples Campaign, which formed in January of this year.  
The months leading up to the Convention saw the expansion of the 
Peoples Campaign into a multi-national coalition comprised of 
residents and organizers who are fighting for democratic reform in 
New Brunswick.  Campaign organizers canvassed New Brunswick for four 
months, collecting over 1000 survey results to form a platform that 
is by the people and for the people.  The top five issues concerning 
New Brunswick's residents are rent control, police brutality, 
education, job availability and training, and youth activities.
Over 150 people attended the Convention, expressing their right to 
democracy and political decision-making.  They unanimously voted in 
favor of the Campaign platform, with their own amendments, proving 
the ability of the people to make political decisions in their own 
interests.
The Convention also chose three candidates to represent them in the 
November election for New Brunswick City Council.  The people chose 
Curtis Warren (New Brunswick Coalition Against Police Brutality), 
Keith Joseph (New Jersey Freedom Organization), and Diego Morales 
(Mexican-American labor organizer).  The three candidates took an 
oath to uphold the will of the people as expressed at the Convention, 
making them the undisputed servants of the people of New Brunswick in 
this year's election.
The multi-national composition of the Convention shows the 
willingness of the people to unite across cultural and ethic lines, 
fighting together for their common interests.  The Latino Committee 
formed at the Convention, composed of more than 30 individuals, and 
nominated candidates from their communities.  Joined by Blacks and 
Euro-Americans, the Convention reflected the cultural and racial 
composition of New Brunswick.
The New Brunswick Peoples Campaign is more than this year's election 
or the three individuals running for City Council, and this is 
evidenced by the enthusiasm and turnout at the Convention.  It is the 
beginning of a mass-based movement that will shake the wealthy 
controllers of New Brunswick from their lofty heights.  The seizure 
of City Council by the people will sound the trumpet of defeat for 
the rulers of New Jersey's cities.  People's Campaigns must spread 
like brush fire -- across the city, across New Jersey, and across the 
country.  Starting in New Brunswick we will light the fire that will 
blaze the path to the overthrow of our oppressors.

Campaign and National Politics: (Keith Joseph)

The first election in United States allowed only 4% of the population 
to vote. You had to own property, you had to be a man and you had to 
be white.  96% of the population did not qualify.  They were women, 
Afro-American, Native Americans, and white men without property. Even 
then America was hailed as a democracy yet the majority of people in 
the country were not allowed to vote. They were ruled by a class of 
property owning white men. 
Since then progress has been: made the civil rights movement, the 
women's suffrage movement extended the right to vote, but for the 
most part the majority of people are stilled ruled by that same tiny 
class. In New Brunswick this has become obvious to many.  Johnson and 
Johnson and other large corporations and banks control the city 
government through the "Democratic" Party machine, and non-
governmental organizations like New Brunswick Tomorrow and  DevCo. 
Across the United States cities are changing.  "Redevelopment" is 
the "politically correct" code word for the ethnic cleansing of our 
cities.  Cities in America used to be the homes of working people of 
all different nationalities.  Now the wealthiest few  want to turn 
the cities into their elite amusement parks, shopping, restaurants 
and theatre.  None of it is affordable or accessible to working 
people.  None of it will be owned by small business people who live 
in New Brunswick.  As "Redevelopment" rolls on more and more of New 
Brunswick's small business are being driven out to make room 
for "National Stores".  In New Brunswick, the politicians of Johnson 
and Johnson are planning the demolition of Memorial Homes.  Yet, they 
have no plans for the relocation of the people in New Brunswick. They 
want the people to leave town. They require a brutal police force 
that can terrorize people who do not follow along with their plans. 
They require a failing school system so that parents will want to 
leave town in search of a good public education for their children.  
We must organize a resistance and struggle to seize political power.  
The People's Campaign is a multi-national, multi-racial organization 
of working people, small business owners, students, and middle class 
people who have come together to work for a different redevelopment 
plan.  We want good schools and recreation and cultural activities 
for the youth. We want an end to police brutality. We want 
redevelopment that puts the people before the profits the of Johnson 
and Johnson. The People's Campaign is about our platform and getting 
it effect.  Our candidates and our organization are tools to win our 
program.

1)  The first sentence seems to be a statement of what the _core 
value_ is, what gives form and meaning to, the proposals that 
follow.  (This is a good way to write a point in a platform, I'd 
imagine).  Is "full and meaningful employment" the best statement of 
that core value -- especially in light of the concepts that follow?

1a)  Does it sound as though the campaign is _seriously_ 
promising "full employment" on the municipal level, as a realizable 
goal?  Will it be interpreted this way?  

1b)  "Meaningful employment" -- this phrase has all sorts of 
pitfalls.  There's is a sound of elitism to it.  I think professing 
the values of fairness and providing opportunities for advancement 
and free choice of vocation is sufficient.  

2)  The last sentence reads:  "We will strongly advocate for pay 
equity policies that can begin to lessen the disparity in wages 
between workers of different genders and nationalities."  This is 
different from, but close to, merely stating sympathy for AA/EEO 
laws, regulations, hiring policies.  The point should probably be 
reconfigured to take this into account -- though I also wonder to 
what extent companies in New Brunswick, and state and federal laws, 
already mandate pay equity (and to what extent they don't).

2b) I will post a critique of the concept of "nationality", as it's 
sometimes used in the campaign, in a separate message.  For the 
moment -- I would suggest changing "genders and nationalities" to 
something like "backgrounds and genders", "gender, racial and ethnic 
backgrounds",  etc.  If nothing else, what is excluded is sexual 
orientation and religion.  

3)  This is a matter of research (Again, I would probably be inclined 
to help on on such tasks):  What leeway does a city government have 
in preferentially granting contracts?  I understand that officially 
prefering unionized firms and firms with more 'diversity' has been 
done before by municipalities (and states).  But can it be mandated 
that companies hire a certain percentage of the town's residents?
Furthermore, any given company, of course, has different echelons of 
employment.  

Some points that came to me.  Hope this is of use.  

Yours,

Jeremy

Thanks.  I'll try to put something together.  I think at this point, 
similarly, that it is vital that solid arguments with strong data 
exist behind every policy statement put forward.  The strongest claim 
that can be made is that the current administration is, 'bottom 
line', incompetent despite pretenses to the contrary.  What has to be 
shown is what, in the final analysis, a city council in New Brunswick 
could really be doing with the available resources.  At minimum.  
This is a minimum that can be proven quite concretely.

I'll abstain for the moment from making arguments either way on this -
- I don't really know enough.  

I will, however, propose this:  If someone decides that a point on 
the platform should be changed, and if there's some determinable 
level of agreement as to this, the point should be revised to say 
something more general _until a sufficiently specific and well-
researched statement can be formulated_.  The process of agreeing to 
change it, and the process of providing an alternative, are thereby 
separated as to provide ample room for discussion.  

Yours,

Jeremy

Subject:Terminology
Message:


Hello.  I will try not to make this too extensive :

I would suggest that there is a good deal of rhetoric being utilized 
in the campaign that should be discussed as to its coherence, 
consistency, accuracy and appropriateness.  There are a number of 
highly anomalous phrases, words that are not commonly recognized by 
most residents of the United States, nonetheless being used as though 
they were to be taken for granted.  OR, they are not commonly used in 
the sense or context in which they're being used in the campaign.  

Rather than analyze in any depth these terms, I will simply list
them.  
I believe they all warrant conscious and open consideration:  this is 
what is required whenever any new word is introduced into a language 
in a democratic society.  

1)  Euro-American
2)  Ethnic Cleansing
3)  Nationality, Multi-National, Nation
4)  The Struggle For Democracy
5)  The People

(#4 and #5 are meant where used in certain particular ways)

PEOPLE!

I am subletting a room for July and August, while I work and reside in NYC.  The room is a single for $300/month + utilities (cheap for the summer).  The room is available now through Labor Day.  It's located at 19 Louis Street b/w Somerset and French St.  It's a 3 bedroom currently occupied by 2 women (no gender preference).  The room includes use of a kitchen, livingroom, laundry facilities, storage space, backyard and is within walking distance of campus buses and public transportation.  The only catch is that there are no pets allowed.

If interested, call Jose Davila at (212) 730-6402 or (718) 861-1774 or email me.

Subject:Board of Education article
Message:

Here's another anchor article for the paper.  Any comments?

Jim

No education without representation!
Zofia Nowakowski

This November 7th New Brunswick residents will vote whether or not to 
have an elected Board of Education.  Parents and the community could 
have real representation and control over decisions made about the 
schools.  For too long our schools have languished.  Change is 
stymied and frustrated by mayoral vetoes and deals for Superintendent 
Larkin's buddies.  The appointed school board's hands are
tied by 
mayoral relationships to organizations receiving contracts.

For too long New Brunswick schools have had poor quality education.  
Working parents decide to send their children to live with 
grandparents to get a decent education.  Parent activists throw up 
their hands in exasperation when they cannot succeed in reforming the 
schools, eventually sending their own children outside the district.

For too long the district schools have provided educational 
opportunities that depend on which school a child attends and who 
they are.  They have actively fostered inequality in the system, with 
our tax dollars, developing semi-private schools such as the charter 
school and Science and Technology High School.

For too long parents have actively engaged the schools for change and 
have seen their ideas ignored.  Recently a site-placed management 
plan hammered out by parents, teachers, and community members was 
vetoed by Mayor Cahill.  We must have recourse when these situations 
develop, and currently no board member is in an independent position 
to speak out against this injustice.

On June 20th the Board of Education met to discuss plans to privatize 
pre-K education.  The plan required moving 3 year-olds from local 
school areas to trailers at the high school.  A privately owned 
education "client company" with non-union teachers 
and "administrators" would direct the education of these
children.  
While the board met behind closed doors, deciding the fate of our 
children's education, the People's Campaign candidates, Keith
Joseph, 
Diego Morales, and Curtis Warren, took charge of the meeting, 
addressing a crowd of 500 parents, residents, and teachers.  The 
audience took over the meeting, expressing their concerns, and 
condemning the board for standing behind neither the children nor the 
teachers' unions.  Due to public outrage, the board cancelled
plans 
for the trailers, but they still intend to privatize the pre-K 
education.

Kate Smith, president of the New Brunswick Education Association, 
said she discussed the need for a contingency plan months before.  
Her suggestions were not addressed.  Contracting additional teachers 
with Innovative Educational Programs (I.E.P.) represented a direct 
attack on our own union teachers.  It favored a corporation that has 
a track record of high turnover in the last year in the Science and 
Technology High School.

New Brunswick, along with 29 other urban "Abbott v. Burke"
districts 
has waited far too long for funding from the state to address 
overcrowded and inadequate facilities, let alone the new mandated pre-
K programs.  Keith Joseph addressed the board on this point, 
demanding that the board act as "a sword for the people rather
than a 
shield for the state."  He called on them to assist residents in 
organizing a state-wide coalition and send residents to Trenton to 
lobby for the funds.

An elected Board of Education would require members to remain 
accountable and in touch with parents and the community.  The public 
would review the school budget, rather than a Board of School 
Estimates (the mayor, two council members, and two appointed board 
members).  Also, the board would increase from 7 to 9 members.
Only 20 of New Jersey's 550 municipalities have an appointed
school 
board.  It is time that New Brunswick win democratic representation 
on its school board so our schools can experience positive change in 
the near future.

Subject:Platform Point
Message:

Hello.

I was advised to present a possible replacement for the 'college for 
all New Brunswick graduates' point on the platform.  For reference,
it 
currently reads: 

Negotiate with Rutgers University, as a condition any city assistance 
with plans for expansion, new buildings, or new programs in the city, 
to provide open admissions and free college education to all New 
Brunswick High School graduates.

I would suggest the following alternative, to be edited or modified 
however:

"Provide enhanced access to higher education and post-high school 
vocational training for all interested New Brunswick graduates.  
Ensure that high school students receive ample assistance with and 
information on scholarship funds and educational opportunities in the 
county, state and nationwide.  Work to guarantee that economic status 
not bar youth from pursuing their life goals."    

This is fairly general -- but it seems to be appropriate to the level 
of knowledge about "what's out there for NB students after
graduation" 
that we presently possess.

I present this as a temporary measure, until something more specific 
can be put together, discussed, and voted on at a general meeting.  I 
will make an argument about this specifically relating to the 
platform's forthcoming publication in the newspaper in a separate 
message.  

Yours,

Jeremy

Subject:Important
Message:


The newspaper, I understand, is going to be published with a complete 
copy of the platform on one of its pages.  

I would argue that the changes I proposed for the 'college education' 
point be included in upcoming publication.  And I would submit this
to 
be feasible while still respecting democracy at all levels.

Why?

1)  The newspaper will be a definitive statement on the campaign and 
its activities, its foremost piece of literature, at least for a 
number of weeks.  The next general meeting, however, won't come until 
after the newspaper has been published.  Thus there's no way to vote 
on any changes in a general meeting beforehand.

2)  I would have proposed at the last General Meeting that the 
authorization to change the platform point to something less specific 
and more inclusive _as a temporary measure_ be voted upon, had I
known 
about the above (#1) problem.

3)  I think I successfully demonstrated that the platform point as it 
currently stands is either factually flawed, or has a great potential 
to prove difficult to defend under any kind of scrutiny.  Indeed, it 
seems that the problems I pointed out, with all due respect, simply 
weren't thought of when the platform's details were voted upon.  

If I were proposing a new addition to the platform, or a new policy 
proposal instead of the thing about Rutgers, that would be different. 
But I am merely proposing that, in the name of factual accuracy, the 
proposal be replaced with something more general -- a few sentences
of 
very generic rhetoric that is almost certainly implicit in the mere 
guarantee of "College for all New Brunswick Residents".  

4)  It should be noted, furthermore, that nobody spoke up to _oppose_ 
changing that point, nor in defense of that point as it was
originally 
formulated, either at the meeting or on this list.  

In fact, I thought that a tacit agreement to replace that point with
a 
more general, rhetorical placeholder had been reached -- provided
that 
it be eventually replaced with something more specific.  

I openly welcome any criticism of my arguments.  

Yours,

Jeremy

Hey,

No, actually, my main point was that that part -- the part about 
Rutgers University -- should be, at least temporarily, taken out of 
the platform.  I wrote a message explaining this in detail a couple 
of weeks ago; if you can't find it, let me know.  I think I was full 
of coffee, and was feeling excessively logical -- every paragraph in 
it is numbered.  Ha.

It may simply be impossible for any municipal government, in short, 
to do the above.  Impossible in the way that the city of New 
Brunswick cannot, for example, ever aspire to send an army to annex 
Highland Park.  Not impossible in the sense of "not sufficiently 
pragmatic".

Yours,

Jeremy

But that is idealism.

In reality, the City Council has no power to do anything

You're not addressing how this suggestion is prohibited. Here's my case for 
including such general wording.

The city council has jurisdiction over some aspects of land use. The 
planning board has jurisdiction over other aspects. The corporations like 
Devco that masquerade as nonprofits do most of this development. They are in 
some ways tied to the wishes of the city government. We'll eventually have a 
full understanding of these relationships. And when we get in city council, 
we'll have some power to make legislation. Right now the city council has 
the power to do that, and they use it to the favor of corporate interests, 
etc. I think it's safe to say that the power of the council can be used to 
flip the script, so let's suggest that in our platform.

If a group wants to build in the city, they have to get city authorization 
in one way or another. That's negotiating power.

Neither you nor anybody else has demonstrated to me that 
they know what this power is, who has it, and what control
City Council has over this.

I'm not just trying to be hard on you Paul.  This is
addressed to the entire campaign.

It seems that there is more rhetoric floating around these
parts than any specific, tactical plan for what happens
when we win.  We have a great platform, but it's very broad.
We will never win if we cannot demonstrate to people what 
exactly it is we want to do.  It's not enough to point out 
how they're wrong.  Lots of people know they're wrong.  But
they won't vote for People's Campaign by default.  We have
to give them a good reason.  This sort of rhetoric is not a 
good reason.

We are *not* going to win on slogans.  We are not going to
win with rhetoric.  We are not going to win with idealistic
notions of people's councils, people's struggle, people's that,
and people's the other thing.

We are going to get our asses *kicked* with that sort of
mentality.  If we pursue a policy of "Rutgers education for
all NB high school graduates," do you know what we look like?

Idiots.

Newsflash.  Rutgers is a state university.  They don't *have*
to build in New Brunswick.  They can build in Newark, Camden,
and even grand ol' Piscataway.  There's more open space in
Piscataway than there is between George Bush's ears.  Rutgers
won't give a flying fig what demands we make of them.  

C'mon already!  I hate to sound harsh, but people have got to
get serious about these things.  We're running a City Council
campaign.  We're not overthrowing the Czar.  We need facts,
not a whole lot of goddam impassioned revolutionary fluff.

I must apologize -- those who state that a vote must be taken before 
any substantive change can be made in the platform are clearly 
correct.  

However, this might illustrate the need for more frequent general

Subject:Re: platform point - Louise, Paul - Why?
Message:

Louise, Paul,

Louise,
 I really have to ask, *why* don't you support the removal
of "anything"?  I must say, Jeremy has gone to the trouble to
post the details of his proposed amendments three times, once
in a message in excess of two pages.  You could have the courtesy
to respond with something other than "no."  I certainly agree with
the need for everyone to have a vote on the issue of changing
the platform, however lets not protect misinformation under the
guise of democracy.

Paul, 
 What factual information do you have that supports the 
assertion that presence of three city council members will 
be able to provide free Rutgers education to all New Brunswick
Graduates?  What in the world leads you to believe that Rutgers
would have any trouble "purchasing land" from the City of New
Brunswick regardless of who is on the city council ?  Considering
the revenue that is generated for the city of New Brunswick by the 
presence of Rutgers University, would it really be in the best 
interest of the City to thwart any attempted growth of the university?

What sort of information base do we have at our disposal to prove 
that the assertions made in the original draft of the platform can be 
achieved?  Do we know that this can be done?  What good is an
unattainable platform?  I would like to know that we have a clear plan
of attack in order to obtain these goals, otherwise we seem lofty
and foolish.

 I fear that we all suffer from a large lack of information.  I would
like to propose that 'Right To Know' release (at least) a single page
of information to the entire campaign on a weekly basis.  Some short 
informational primer that can be held at the office as well as 
available on-line.  I am pleased that there is a lot of emotional 
drive and passion about these issues, however passion alone will not 
win this.

Sincerely
- Michael

Message:

I would like to invite all to a class in Reevaluation Counseling to be held at my house 218 Townsend this Wednesday July 12th at 7pm- 9:30pm.  This will be the first of several classes to be taught by a friend of mine, Lydia Simas.  Basically it is a form of peer counseling, based on a listening and cathartic process.  It can help people regain a sense of calmness and think better about themselves and others on the campaign.  It has been used by other political campaigns, and utilizing it in the campaign and in our lives can help improve our health, organization, and ultimately success.  The community of people that has developed largely voluntarily to spread this understanding of counseling also works actively toward the liberation of all humans from oppression through work on racism, sexism, agism, class oppression, religious oppression, etc etc etc. For a very watered down version, visit the website at www.rc.org.

Subject:Why I think platform points are political stmts.
Message:

I think this whole big discussion boils down to two political lines: I'm 
saying that the platform and our calls as the campaign are designed to 
express the will of the people and to project their needs onto the political 
and economic systems in New Brunswick. Not every call can be realized right 
away. But there is an important purpose for those calls. We need to 
crystallize in people's minds what kind of future is possible, when people 
have more power. The call to cut a deal with local institutions is a 
political demand by the people. They know they're being exploited by 
powerful institutions and they respond by informing and endorsing our 
political calls.

The reality of current laws and power relationships may not allow for 
immediate imposition of our (the people's) demands. That's because the 
bourgeoisie and imperialist classes designed this system and continually 
contour it to their liking and needs. We know that their needs often run 
counter to the needs of the people. Class conscious folks that I've met on 
the street, etc., will acknowledge that the interests of J&J and other 
bourg-imperialist interests are not the interests of the people.

So, just as the ruling classes put out constant, hard driving lines which 
are often semi-legal or outright illegal: about how they want to privatize 
everything, tax you for everything, steal the public's money with corp. 
welfare, put all black and latino youth in prison, send the cops to take 
everyone's DNA, etc., etc. You get the idea-So do we need to put out our 
lines.

They shape the law and we have to deal with that assuming that we're bound 
to bourgeois notions of electoral politics, or we put out a political call 
for real power to the people and foreshadow future legal, political and 
legislative battles in the name of people's power.

I think we should scrutinize our platform points, but keep in mind that the 
campaign is about changing these relationships which are killing the people 
everyday. And I don't mean to say that we're going to accomplish them with 
three city council seats.

Message:

No way.  

This has nothing to do with differing "political lines."  I will 
agree, however that there is a difference in definition here; 
the definition of the platform.  I'm working from the assumption 
that the platform should be regarded as a list of things that we 
intend to do and provide for the people in New Brunswick - things 
we CAN and WILL do.  I do not see them as a list of "what kind of 
future is possible" -- at that rate we might as well be releasing 
fictional 
stories.  Our job is not that of a "teacher" to the 'enslaved masses 
of New Brunswick' that view point is not only out of line, it's 
insulting.

My concern is that in trying to realize some of these platform
points, we may find they are simply not possible. I hardly think we 
can win the people over with a platform that would be nice, "in 
theory."  
Shouldn't the platform contain what the candidates are
going to try to provide to the city, to their supporters, to the
people?  If we can't make good on our promises, we are lying.  If
we don't at least gauge the feasibility of these points, we are
opening ourselves up to let a lot of people down.

I'm working on this campaign because I see it as an effort to try
and improve the lives of people in New Brunswick.  A lot of people
have been screwed over and this does not have to happen.  I'm not
going to feel comfortable handing someone a list of promises that
we don't know if we can keep.  I would not feel comfortable taking
a person's vote under the same reasoning.  Most importantly, a person
will likely not cast their vote if they feel they will not get what
we are promising.

I am not out to bring social revolution to New Brunswick; I want to 
make life better for those who have been getting the short end 
of the stick.  I would like to see the "success" of  New Brunswick 
lead to better education for the children in New Brunswick, I'd like 
to see new businesses in New Brunswick equal new jobs for the 
resident's of New Brunswick.  I believe in the platform points, I 
believe they are good things.  I simply want to make sure 
we know what we can and can not do.

Am I out of line?

Again, I am asking the same question.  Perhaps I was unclear
before.

In what way do you feel that Jeremy's is "very different" than
the current platform point, or the point that he raised at the 
last general meeting?

I'm not trying to be nitpicky, but my intent was to get
your opinion on why this was a radical departure from what we

Also,

Lifeless stream provokes a lawsuit 

07/07/00

By Alexander Lane
STAFF WRITER

Carlos Cortez knows he isn't supposed to play in the
stream near his New Brunswick home. But he does, along
with packs of other kids who live in the Hamilton
Gardens apartment complex, a collection of low
buildings just feet from the Mile Run Brook. 


When he comes home with muddy shoes, he gets a stern
lecture from his mother, who worries about the craggy
rocks and the tough older kids that hang out there. 


But according to recent tests, more sinister,
invisible dangers lurk in the stream: Lead. Arsenic.
Cadmium. Camphor. PCBs. 


''I've never seen any fish in there," Carlos, 11,
said. "Never." 


Rhodia Inc., a small chemical company upstream from
Carlos' neighborhood, has been polluting the brook for
decades, state environmental officials say. 


Fourteen years ago, a state judge ordered Rhodia to
stop the pollution and clean its land, with monitoring
by the state Department of Environmental Protection. 


On Wednesday, an environmental group sued both Rhodia
and the DEP, saying they allowed the pollution to
continue. 


With the lawsuit looming two weeks ago, the DEP sent a
20-page letter to Rhodia calling it "nonresponsive"
and "administratively deficient" in cleaning up. 


Mile Run Brook cuts through Rhodia's property, and the
stream bank comes right up against Building 11, where
a fragrance ingredient is made. 


A shiny black ooze seeps out from under Building 11
and into the stream, according to the DEP letter, and
groundwater infused with chemicals also bleeds into
the brook. 


The stream water has a bright sheen and the sweet
stench of the fragrance ingredient ethyl vanillin. The
bottom is black. The water cannot support life of any
kind -- not aquatic insect life, much less fish. 


''The contamination from this area has remained
relatively uncontrolled since the discharge was first
observed over 14 years prior," wrote Stephen Maybury,
chief of the DEP's Bureau of Environmental Evaluation,
in the June 22 letter. 


Maybury compared the texture of the seeping product to
molasses. 


''The material going into the stream should not be
going into the stream at this point," he said. 


Rhodia's 37 employees manufacture coumarin, an
ingredient that lends a pleasant scent to nearly every
detergent on the market. 


According to the DEP, the property has suffered
extensively under the French company. A state site
inspection report, written in 1991, documented a long
list of environmental mishaps at Rhodia. 


The report said the company illegally stored toxic
waste in basements in 1981. A few months later, a
worker complained of a rash after handling radioactive
vegetables and soil. A long list of sewer breaks,
shoddy storage, oily seeps, errant drums and other
violations continues past 1986. 


In 1989, 10 to 15 gallons of process water and ethyl
vanillin flowed into the Mile Run Brook after a sewer
line froze, according to the 1991 report. The potent
fragrance ingredient is detectable even in a mix of
one part per billion. 


Plant manager Michael Emery said the company has spent
more than $7 million on environmental improvements
since 1986. Rhodia also has begun removing a tanker of
tainted groundwater every six weeks at a cost of
$10,000 each time, Emery said. 


The DEP letter was in response to a thick document
Rhodia submitted to the state, the company's clean- up
plan. The "Remedial Action Workplan" was to be the
first step in the last stage of a long-term cleanup. 


But the state found shortcomings with the plan.
Officials said Rhodia failed to submit a study of the
brook's ecology and failed to stop the pollution from
Building 11, which is the 19-acre plant's only
operational building. 


Rhodia last had a state-certified lab test the soil
and groundwater on their property in July 1998. The
lab detected toluene, a compound that can cause
leukemia, at 2,400 parts per billion. The state's
limit is 1,000. Cumene was detected at 520 parts per
billion. The maximum limit is 300. 


Nitrobenzene, a cancer-causing chemical that is easily
absorbed into the skin and can cause nausea, headache,
irritability, dizziness, weakness, and drowsiness, was
detected at 2,300 parts per billion. The legal maximum
is 10 parts per billion. 


The chemical camphor was detected at 740,000 parts per
billion. The state has not set a maximum level for the
rare contaminant, but it is known to cause headache,
fainting, arrhythmia, convulsions and tumors. 


Some tests have shown that camphor is the main
ingredient in the black seep. Other tests point to
toluene. Rhodia has not had it tested it enough, the
state said, nor has the company adequately tested the
soil and water in the Mile Run thus far. 


Fed up with the pace of the clean-up, the Edison
Wetlands Association -- the group that sued the state
and Rhodia -- hired the Citizens Environmental
Laboratory of Cambridge, Mass., and South Mall
Analytical Labs of Plainview, N.Y. to test the brook.
They say they found levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead
and PCBs that exceed state maximums. 


The stream cuts through one of the few remaining
industrial areas of New Brunswick. Emery contends that
much of the contamination for which Rhodia is being
blamed comes from years past. 


The Rhodia property was once New Brunswick's municipal
landfill. Rhone Poulenc bought it in 1919. Du Pont
bought it in the 1930s, then sold it back to Rhone
Poulenc in 1955. 


Stopping the contaminated groundwater seepage and
black gunk from oozing out of Building 11 and into the
stream is compounded by the building's proximity to
the stream, Emery said. 


''It's very difficult when it comes to finding a
solution without cutting the heart out of the
company," he said. "My job is to make sure there's a
plant here when my people retire." 


Rhodia now has 30 days to adjust its cleanup plan and
resubmit it to the state.

That's good.  Tell that to your consistuency.  Tell them

Really intelligent.

"Such things?"  What?  The City Council is going to seize
land from Rutgers?  

Or even better, we'll force them to admit everybody from New
Brunswick that wants to go.  As if the academic standards 
at Rutgers haven't fallen enough. 

I'm sorry.  Not everybody in New Brunswick *deserves* to go to
Rutgers.  The demand that everybody who graduates New Brunswick
High School go to Rutgers is completely ridiculous.

Zofia, this is almost beside the point (although I support

Our platform calls for admission of all New Brunswick

Are you comfortable bringing this to people?  Are you 
comfortable showing this to Rutgers students, whose

showing this to Rutgers professors, who are already sick
of the low academic standards to make room for football
players?  For that matter, are you comfortable making this

I have to answer "nay" to all of the above.

I support Jeremy's more reasonable amendment.

Zofia, living next to a brook that has been carrying the run off of these 
contaminents has made me very aware. The water is undrinkable and there are 
times that I even question bathing in it let alone taking a shower. I put 
water in my fridge to drink( after boiling it thinking that would make it 
drinkable) but when I drank it, it had a very strong almost mettalic taste 
and smell. I buy my drinking water now, but I have been plagued by skin 
rashes since I've lived here, 5years. Paul and Tom turned me onto an 
organization that I can go to and possibly get my water tested to find out 
what I'm dealing with. I really appreciate your info.

Subject:Our Program
Message:


At the last General meeting Jeremy suggested that everyone graduateing from
NewBrunswick high school may not want to go to Rutgers.  Perhaps they would prefer a
vocational training or artistic training or county college or whatever.  Everyone
agreed that this was a good point and should be taken into consideration and raised
again.  What has come back is a complete departure from the original platform and from
what was stated at the last general meeting. The propoal is to make the platfrom
"reasonable", "realistic", "acceptable" etc.
Perhaps our platform should have stated more clearly we want "open admissons" at
Rutgers for a start, like they had at CUNY before Ghouliani gutted that with similar
arguements to the ones we are hearing against our current paltform point.  If we
remember the attacks on CUNY's "remedial" programs (which are also currently available
at Rurtgers, Yale, Harvard etc. in Fact Bush 2 and his Daddy's boy Quale spent much
time in these programs).  The question of a education at an IVY League school is not
one of  inttelctual  question but of  financial ability.  The point of admitting New
Brunswick high school graduates at Rutgers would address that fact head on.  I
strongly disagree that academic standars at Rutgers would decrease if poor people were
allowed to attended in fact quite the opposite a healthy dose of reality is just what
is needed at Rutgers.

Finally there is an emerging tendency in our campaign that believes it is more
important for us to know how everything works in the city before we can organize the
people.  That is policy is more important than organizing the people.  But the point
of our campaign is to empower the people.  (the people are students, workers,
proffesionals, small business people, small land lords as oppossed to the big monopoly
capitalists and their goons and stooges). Our slogan is not "Putting policy first".
Our program is not a laundry list of promises.  It is a fighting strategy, without the
mobilization and organization of the people of New Brunswick none of it is possible.
Our Campaign and our candiadtes must be  tools and weapons that the people must weild
to sieze power and enact policy that they themselves determine.  Our purpose as
camapign organizers is to mobilize, organize and guide the people towards the goal of
seizing power. Policy is important but it can not be determined by a small group in a
back room, or maybe it can be... but that is the method of the democatic party
machine.  Our platform is not unrealistic, it was determined by 1000 surveys and voted
on by a 150 people, that is its reality and reasonableness .  If current laws,
ideologies, institutions, and even the economic system stand in the way of enacting
the program than the people will determine how those obtacles need to be transformed
or eliminated. I think that our campaign stands for higher education for all; if there
is something in the way of that I think our campaign should help people to remove the
obstacle. Our campaign should definetly not play the role of explaining why their
aspiations are unrealistic.  We are not a shield for the status quo our campaign must
be the sword of the people.

	First and foremost you really should define how Jeremy's point is a
"complete departure" from the original drafting.  Until you define that, I
will disregard your comment as a baseless assertion.  Also, what is the
point in
having 'reasonable' 'realistic' and 'acceptable' in quotes?  I think its
fairly clear
that (as adjectives) the words themselves are in no way negative.  Do
you find these words to be negative or you are implying that there is a
secret conspiracy afoot which is using these words as some sort of a
disguise  ?
This post reads as though you are warning against some sort of lurking evil

Rutgers is not an Ivy league school, and I assure you MANY wealthy students
are
declined yearly.

If you open the doors to a university based on a factor other than a
measurement of
intellectual performance (ie: geographical location) you are guaranteed to
lower the
average of academic standards.  This is easily proven to anyone who attended
high school
(an educational facility in which the students are admitted by location).
What we find
in the average high school is usually several programs of varied difficulty,
for students
of varied "talent/achievement" levels (remedial, standard, honors, etc).
Saying you do not believe in this is preposterous and somewhat frightening.

Who said knowing "everything" -- I said knowing something about the promises
we are
making.   We should ensure that we can provide what we claim before we
organize, lest we
run the risk of organizing around something we may not be able to achieve.
Do you really
find this notion to be absurd?

How can you empower people if you are not clear on what you can do for them,
what can really be achieved?  What are we organizing around if we are not
armed
with this knowledge?  What power can we give to people without that?

Who the hell said anything about putting policy first?

Keith, I regard a promise as a guarantee to do something.  I maintain that
the program is
a list of promises.  Yes people need to be organized, yes people need to be
mobilized, but
the program is in no way a strategy; a strategy is a guideline that leads to
an end.  The
platform as it is written today is simply the end, with the occasional vague
notion
of achieving some goal.

More accurately, the campaign is the glue between the disconnected people of
New Brunswick,
it intends to provide the unity from which the power is derived.  In my
mind, as that glue,
we must not only encourage working together and "mobilization" however arm
people with
information.  Information not only about corruptions in the existing
government, but also
what they can do to change things, to overcome them.  It is very easy to
point a finger
and say something is not working.  It's hard to derive a solution.

Saying you are going to "mobilize" someone is about as meaningful as a
million other
buzzwords that exist in society today.  Mobilize them to do what?  To take
back their
rights?  What does that mean?  A lot of shallow words with very little
meaning.

What does this mean?

The platform points are good.  Also after speaking with Brian and Frank for
some
time the other night, I have a much stronger sense that many things on the
platform
can and will be achieved.   Determination by surveys or votes, however, does
not
guarantee 'reasonableness'.

Again, I think it's OUR job to understand what changes/transformations need
to be made,
so we can give this information to the people.  I think many of the full
time activists
on-board have a much better shot at researching this information than
someone who works
2 jobs a day to put food on the table, don't you?

For all the passion in this campaign, we need twice as much FACT.  I am glad
that people
believe in this, however our "mission" is not simply to rile people up, it's
to give them
information they could not have.  To really "arm" people, with their rights.
We should
not simply tell people things are bad, we must tell them how they can help
make it right.
Collecting adjectives such as "organization" or "mobilization" is not good
enough.  We need
to tell people (or at least know) what we will do once we have achieved
organization and
mobilization.

Very tired . . .

Let the record show that one of "the people's" candidates

Evidentally the only person who needs a healthy dose of
reality is you, Keith.

It stands to reason (by all the laws of logic) that if you admit
students based upon locality instead of merit that your standards
*must* decrease.  Unless you believe that people are necessarily
more intelligent by virtue of being poor.

Again, in the interests of gaining the support of Rutgers students,
Rutgers faculty, and, most importantly, the residents of the city
of New Brunswick, we should call for improved access to higher
education -- be it the University or technical training -- and
remove all bars to it based upon financial level.

I'll be so kind as to *not* embarrass you by responding to this
burst of emotional rhetoric with the cold impassiveness of reason
and reality.  Mike did a good enough job -- I agree with what he said.

Unfortunately, your opponents -- Cook, Recine, and Schrum --
will not do the same in a debate.  I'd suggest a change of
attitude between now and then.

Residents wonder: Where can we go?

Published in the Home News Tribune 7/09/00

By JAKE STUIVER
STAFF WRITER

Once, it was a jewel of downtown New Brunswick.

Gov. Morgan F. Larson was its first guest in 1929, and the top-floor 
penthouse of the building originally known as The Woodrow Wilson Hotel held 
the city's most swinging parties and prestigious events.

Now, human corpses, stairwell feces, rotting food, 3-month-old beer empties, 
rats and mice are the main attractions at the Monument Park Hotel. That, and 
a group of residents teetering on homelessness.

After numerous highs and lows and changes in name and ownership over the 
past 70 years, the eight-story building at 10 Livingston Ave. is a few 
months away from becoming rubble.

Its new owner, the New Brunswick Development Corp., wants to make way for 
the 15-story Heldrich Plaza hotel and conference center that would cover the 
entire block.

The problem is, the hotel isn't exactly a hotel anymore. That is, its 
patrons usually don't check out the next day. Some of them haven't checked 
out for more than 10 years.

Many of the 50 or 60 residents and families still living at the hotel are 
there because of the relatively low living costs (usually about $800 a month 
and no utility expenses) and the fact that they were placed there by social 
services.

Add that to the 245-unit housing project down the street also slated for 
demolition by year's end for another redevelopment plan, and the city's 
poorest residents are all scrambling to find new places to live.

DevCo acquired the hotel for $2.7 million through bankruptcy court May 1 
after its prior owner, Donald Cresitello of Morristown-based Tello 
Enterprises, failed to restore the business to its early glory and ran into 
financial problems.

Within a week, a foul stench led the new owners to a dead body that had 
allegedly been sitting in one of the rooms since at least a few days prior 
to the property transfer. Another tenant's corpse turned up a few weeks 
later in a bizarre incident with a prostitute.

Though Cresitello denies it, representatives of DevCo and the firm hired to 
manage the site until demolition claim he pulled out all the phone wires, 
and they invested in restoring service to tenants.

While many residents are looking for new homes, they're grumbling that as 
long as they pay rent at the hotel, they're entitled to have somebody clean 
up the hallways and stairwells, which are full of trash and, in some places, 
human waste.

Until last week, when reporters began inquiring about the hotel's condition, 
the bar and basement were covered in food and glass empties from a party 
residents said the former managers had before they cleared out in May.

Some of the residents, including fifth-floor tenant Glenda Reaves, said they 
feel like the owners are trying to give them incentives to leave quickly.

"That is an absurd out-and-out lie," said Mitch Broder of One-Zero Hotel 
Management and Raritan Property Management, the firm DevCo hired to run the 
building. "To the contrary, we've bent over backward to be as accommodating 
as we can . . . to respond to any requests. We've turned on phones for 
people that we know are imminently moving, at huge expense for us. We have a 
full-time cleaning person cleaning the building. We have an exterminator. 
We've upgraded fire and electrical systems."

The messes in the halls and stairwells, Broder said, should have been 
brought to his attention instead of to the press.

New Jersey hotels face inspection, overseen by the state Department of 
Community Affairs, every five years. As long as the building is still 
standing and operational, it's subject to health and fire standards, DCA 
spokesman John Patella said.

The Monument Park Hotel's demolition is targeted for October. Its next 
inspection is due in September.


Moving the poor
Residents in the nearby New Brunswick Homes public housing are slowly 
getting out.

Some are finding affordable housing in the area. Others are hoping the city 
keeps promises for spots in the new low-income units planned for the site 
and other locations downtown.

Being public-housing tenants, however, can mean expedited Section 8 vouchers 
and other assistance that the hotel tenants won't get.

There's nothing Middlesex County can offer the tenants other than its 
standard homeless services such as rental assistance, said county Freeholder 
Jane Brady, chair of the Human Services Committee.

The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development focuses on family 
units, but there's also a need for what's known as single-room occupancy, 
she said.

"The problem is that there is just nothing out there for these people," she 
said. "They are looking for very low-income places to
live, and there just isn't any in this county. It is very disturbing that we 
are losing what was our last remaining single-room-occupancy unit."

The city plans to build low-income units at George Street and Remsen Avenue 
and in the soon-to-be-replaced Lord Stirling School, but those would go to 
Homes residents first, Mayor Jim Cahill said. Anything left after all the 
Homes residents are moved could go to former hotel residents if they 
qualify, he said.

Issues such as transportation, proximity to work and social services make it 
desirable for the residents to stay in the city, but most options would be 
better than living at the hotel, the mayor said.

"The hotel has not been well run, it has not been well managed," he said, 
adding many people have been moving out on their own. "As these numbers 
dwindle, it becomes easier to focus on the remaining residents."

Residents are organizing to learn and demand their rights.

A new group in the city called Advocates to Empower the Poor, headed by the 
formerly homeless Victor Luna, has been working to rally tenants and get 
them legal counseling.

A few hotel residents, such as Debra Key, have taken matters into their own 
hands by holding tenant meetings and consulting with Middlesex County Legal 
Services Corp.

Jose Abreu, a staff attorney with Legal Services' housing unit who's been 
working closely with tenants at the hotel, said he's encouraging them to 
challenge the notices to move out.

The notices were issued in May with July 31 deadlines, but that might not be 
adequate, Abreu said. He said he considers DevCo a private entity that must 
provide 18 months' notice.

Even if a judge deems DevCo a government agency, which needs to give only 
three months' notice, the letters contain no language about the type of 
mandatory relocation assistance the owner will provide, he said.

The residents don't have money to put down for moving costs and security 
deposits, and they're entitled to aid from the landlord
casting them out, he said.

The management should also offer help finding new homes, considering the 
low-rent housing market is so saturated with Homes and hotel residents 
pouring out simultaneously, he said.

Residents have been getting varying amounts of money as part of their 
agreements to leave.

"The only thing they've offered us is moving assistance," Key said. "Where 
are we going to move to? They're just trying to slide us up under the door. 
We're just asking for what's right, and they're trying to find every way 
around it."

Once a Palace
When the New Brunswick Hotel Corp. opened the Woodrow Wilson in 1929, one 
newspaper headline read "New Brunswick Crowns with Laurel its $850,000 
Hostelry."

The opening ceremony guest list included U.S. senators and congressmen, 
state officials and Rutgers University President John
M. Thomas.

Its suites, which include a bedroom, kitchenette and main area not much 
bigger than the bathroom, were once touted as the latest in comfort.

Its history is long and winding, but two things are clear: In 1940, it 
underwent the first of many name changes, to the Roger Smith Hotel; Sometime 
in the 1970s, the hotel began losing clientele, part of a citywide 
recession.

Cresitello said he bought the building in 1986 after it had been closed for 
several years, possibly because of problems with the city.

He said he invested about $7.5 million in renovations and reopened it as a 
Days Inn in 1988. He said there were problems with the Days Inn company, and 
in the early '90s he converted to a Howard Johnson's, soon to become the 
Monument Park Hotel.

"At that point, we took in whatever customers we could take," he said. "Some 
were long-term, some were welfare."

Much of the city's revitalization was supposed to happen 10 years ago, and 
the delay hurt the hotel industry, Cresitello said.

"We just figured the town wasn't ready for us," he said. "We got caught in 
the stall. We were never fully able to recover from it."

Now that redevelopment's day has come, the main redeveloper sees 
Cresitello's failure as DevCo's gold mine.

DevCo wants to raze the entire block between Livingston Avenue and New 
Street to build the Heldrich Center, which will also house a Rutgers 
work-force development school and a huge parking garage.

About 75 percent of the block is on the way to DevCo control, but most of it 
needs to go down before the hotel to make room for the collapse of the 
taller building, DevCo President Chris Paladino said.

"Getting the hotel was the cornerstone of the acquisition," Paladino said. 
"Without that, we would not have been able to move forward."

Paladino doesn't expect everybody to be out of the hotel until September, 
and he said DevCo is doing what it can to help find housing.

He noted, however, that it's still a hotel, not an apartment building, and 
that its rates aren't exactly poverty-level.

"At $800 a month, people are not homeless," he said. "$800 is not an 
insignificant amount of money."

He also noted Heldrich will create 500 jobs, plus another 3,000 during 
construction, and will provide training programs to employ people from the 
area.

Ultimately, DevCo is hoping to restore the block's luster.

On the inside
That doesn't mean much to the Lopez family, having lived on the hotel's 
fourth floor for the past eight years.

Ceasar Lopez, 26, drives to work at USA Detergents in North Brunswick but 
stays at the hotel because his 1-year-old son, Ceasar Jr., has Scimitas 
syndrome and has to see five doctors a month at city hospitals.

His wife, Anna Ramirez, 27, sits by Ceasar Jr. most of the time to make sure 
his ventilator unit, which takes up one-third of their tiny living room, 
stays operational.

The couple would love to have a bigger place but can't find one they can 
afford that's close enough to the hospitals.

When the notice to vacate arrived in May, Lopez was floored.

"It got everybody crazy," he said. "Nobody was expecting that."

Not everybody is as reluctant to leave as Lopez.

For Glenda Reaves, 47, of the fifth floor, the push out the door marks the 
end of a long, horrible nightmare at Monument Park.

A long-neglected ceiling leak has left her with mice, exposed asbestos and 
permanently mangled hands.

Condensation from the air conditioner upstairs ate through the ceiling 
panels right above the center of her main room, and for the  past two 
summers she's had her floor constantly covered in towels and bowls.

Once, while she was hanging towels out the bathroom window to dry, the loose 
frame slammed down on her hands and left her fingers twisted. She said she's 
suing the former owner.

Reaves said Advocates to Empower the Poor found her a real-estate company 
that got her into a Hampton Club residence subsidized by her social-services 
payments, and she's moving there next week, although the hotel's new 
management has been letting her use a seventh-floor room in the meantime.

Maybe at her new home, she hopes, she won't have to sleep on a cot mattress 
on the floor because there'll be room for both her and her 15-year-old 
daughter to have separate beds.

"I'm not a dirty person," she said, gesturing toward her makeshift bedroom 
by the towel pile. "But right now, living for the next day. It's all I can 
do. I don't want to live like this ever again."

Subject:Let's all be "reasonable" shall we?
Message:

Jeremy raises excellent points indeed.  He also did it in a way that was 
professional and with tact.  I think we could all learn a thing or two.  
First, Keith, people in New Brunswick who filled out the 1000 surveys (I 
don't have a copy of the survey--but I think I'm not mistaken) sited that 
education and the accessibilty of higher education was among one of the most 
important issues in NB, they didn't say that they wanted or thought that 
every high school graduate in NB should be accepted into Rutgers.  This 
platform point was the campaign's way of accomodating for what we regard as 
an important issue.  Also, if we are not to be policy wonks (in X's words) 
than we must be flexible in our platform.  Not to the extent that we will 
abandon our belief that the people of NB should have the power of running 
the city, but in the way in which we pursue the important issues that people 
have informed us about (education, police brutality etc.)  There are many 
angles that we have not looked at yet.

For example, not only is it unreasonable to say that a state university 
should accept students from only one of the towns that houses its many 
campauses, not only is it shortsighted to believe that all NB high school 
students even WANT to go to college, but let's be honest--is going to 
college the end all be all of having a better life and education?  Of course 
not.  I would be happier saying that the city should give heavy subsidies to 
students from NB to go to college--and for god's sake!  let's concentrate on 
giving these public high school students some resources while they're in 
high school still.  Let's concentrate on giving them a true education by 
treating our teachers fairly and giving them the resources to prepare these 
kids for life and if they so choose for the higher education of their 
choosing.  College nothing...  it'll only get you so far.

I think there has been a great deal of word and idea-bending in this debate. 
  It's senseless.  For example, I highly doubt that Mike and Jim believe 
that low income families will bring down the educational standards of 
Rutgers.  (Although, Mike and Jim--I think you could both relax a bit with 
the whole educational standards argument--money determines a school's 
rankings not the students).  In closing, I will repeat myself, not only do 
we need to organize and outreach to everyone we can--but we must continually 
develop ourselves and organize eachother within the campaign.  I think we 
should discuss this platform point at the next general meeting.

Yours,
Nikki "my dog's ain't with it" Adler ;-)

One thought I had to reconcile some of the issues we are discussing is,

1. As a platform identify a general final goal - ex - jobs with a living wage for all NB residents - and then indicate specific concrete things that we would consider doing as an initial idea of a step toward that goal.  I think both sorts of goals are important.  Im not sure whether now is the time to make any actual promises regarding specific steps - we need more citizen participation before taking a particular course.

2. Also maybe we can set up an info library at the office with copies of all sorts of information and documents and make it available to residents to copy.  Any process steps to improve info distribution and eliminate hoarding of info/ info bottlenecks which I admit as RTK I have been reponsible for in part.

At the last General meeting Jeremy suggested that everyone 
graduateing from NewBrunswick high school may not want to go to 
Rutgers.  Perhaps they would prefer a vocational training or artistic 
training or county college or whatever.  Everyone agreed that this 
was a good point and should be taken into consideration and raised 
again.  What has come back is a complete departure from the original 
platform and from what was stated at the last general meeting. The 
propoal is to make the 
platfrom "reasonable", "realistic", "acceptable" etc. 
[unquote]

Well, first of all, let's just establish that no modifications of the 
platform are about to take place until voted upon at the next General 
Meeting.  So nobody is claiming that what I tried to express thereby 
gave legitimacy to a rewrite of that platform point without a binding 
vote.  Perhaps General Meetings are too infrequent?

Otherwise, I don't see on what basis you can sensibly protest -- your 
tone is certainly one of protest -- that "What has come back is a 
complete departure from the original platform".  For all that has 
taken place is informal discussion, and the submission (solely to the 
mailing list) of a very tentative replacement for the Higher Ed point.
Everyone is indeed welcome to discuss these things further, here or 
elsewhere, and they will certainly be submitted for very active 
consideration at the General Meeting.  (Hopefully, the means will 
soon exist in the office on Redmond for people who don't have 
computers to access this list.)    
 
I apologize if I was not terribly clear -- I was not -- at the last 
meeting, but I most certainly meant that the whole point, 
including "negotiating with Rutgers" should be called into question.

[quote]
... Perhaps our platform should have stated more clearly we 
want "open admissons" at Rutgers for a start, like they had at CUNY 
before Ghouliani gutted that with similar arguements to the ones we 
are hearing against our current paltform point.  If we remember the 
[..unquote]

This manner of arguing, though probably unintentional, comes across 
as a cheap demonizing tactic.  There are no Giuliani sympathizers, 
young Giulianis, or Giulianis-in-an-alternate-universe in this 
campaign, I am fairly certain.  

And more importantly, what is CUNY?  CUNY is the City University of 
New York.  Rutgers is the State University of New Jersey.  We're 
dealing with a qualitatively different kind of city government-local 
university relationship.

attacks on CUNY's "remedial" programs (which are also currently 
available at Rurtgers, Yale, Harvard etc. in Fact Bush 2 and his 
Daddy's boy Quale spent much time in these programs).  The question 
of a education at an IVY League school is not one of  inttelctual  
question but of  financial ability.  The point of admitting New 
Brunswick high school graduates at Rutgers would address that fact 
head on.  I strongly disagree that academic standars at Rutgers would 
decrease if poor people were allowed to attended in fact quite the 
opposite a healthy dose of reality is just what is needed at Rutgers.
[unquote]

Yes, but in the final analysis, this can only be framed in terms of a 
statewide strategy.  A city council can be part of a statewide 
strategy of pushing for reform from below -- city councils can take 
activist roles to some extent at higher echelons of government.  But 
this activist role is clearly secondary.  (By "activist role", I'm 
not referring to 'Peoples' Councils' or whatever -- that's a 
completely different thing)

Oh, and let me repeat this :

Open admissions does not guarantee a high graduation rate at 
Rutgers.  Rutgers very frequently lowers its admissions standards for 
students from school districts like New Brunswick, Jersey City, 
Bridgeton, Camden, wherever.  But it only works so hard to guarantee 
that these students stay in Rutgers for four or five years and 
graduate successfully.  And, to be frank, Rutgers is a large and 
unsupportive environment no matter what you do to it.  Remedial 
programs can do alot for reading and math skills, for example, 
but 'cultural capital' is a bit more of a problem -- knowing how to 
be a student.  Indeed, that is one of the virtues of County Colleges 
as preparatory institutions for people who want to go on to a school 
like Rutgers.

[quote]
Finally there is an emerging tendency in our campaign that believes 
it is more important for us to know how everything works in the city 
before we can organize the people.  That is policy is more important 
than organizing the people.  But the point of our campaign is to 
empower the people.  (the people are students, workers, 
proffesionals, small business people, small land lords as oppossed to 
the big monopoly capitalists and their goons and stooges). Our slogan 
is not "Putting policy first". Our program is not a laundry list of 
promises.  It is a fighting strategy, without the mobilization and 
organization of the people of New Brunswick none of it is possible. 
Our Campaign and our candiadtes must be  tools and weapons that the 
people must weild to sieze power and enact policy that they 
themselves determine.  Our purpose as camapign organizers is to 
mobilize, organize and guide the people towards the goal of seizing 
power. Policy is important but it can not be determined by a small 
[unquote]

"Seizure of power" is still a fragment of imagery.  Nobody is 
literally "seizing power".  Power is asserted through the 
construction, organization and revitalization of institutions, not 
seized.  A literal seizure of power is violent, or usually implies 
violence.    

Let me provide this simple framework:  The ultimate assertion of 
power is all against one strongman;  the ultimate assertion of 
strength is one strongman over all.  Strength and power should not be 
conflated.  (This model can be found most definitively in Thomas 
Hobbes)  

There is, finally, a difference between analysis and rhetoric that 
should be recognized!  And, let's not forget, rhetoric can be 
analyzed, and analysis can shape rhetoric. 

[quote]
group in a back room, or maybe it can be... but that is the method of 
the democatic party machine.  Our platform is not unrealistic, it was 
determined by 1000 surveys and voted on by a 150 people, that is its 
reality and reasonableness .  If current laws, ideologies, 
institutions, and even the economic system stand in the way of 
enacting the program than the people will determine how those 
obtacles need to be transformed or eliminated. I think that our 
campaign stands for higher education for all; if there is something 
in the way of that I think our campaign should help people to remove 
the obstacle. Our campaign should definetly not play the role of 
explaining why their aspiations are unrealistic.  We are not a shield 
for the status quo our campaign must be the sword of the people. 
[unquote]

And we should recognize the limits of the General Will as a concept.  
Namely, the Will of the People is something that is always being 
interpreted and reinterpreted -- even the will of an individual comes 
about only through self-interpretation and criticism of oneself and 
one's environment.  The campaign doesn't know the Will of the People 
in some magical, unmediated way.   

There is room both for specialization and democracy.  Don't set up a 
false opposition between Policy and Democracy.  That is utterly 
absurd.  What, are thousands of people going to get together in 
Buccleuch Park every day to debate the minutae of traffic light 
regulations, or whether park benches should be made out of spruce or 
mahogany?  Democracy consists of accountability and trust, but trust 
implies distance.  The Peoples' Campaign seems to stand for there 
being the right degree and kind of distance between the represented 
and the representatives.  

Yours,

Jeremy

With respect to "citizen participation" let me just affirm
and expand upon what you appear to be saying:

A significant element in the campaign's work is researching, 
assessing, and making contacts with various organizations, activist 
efforts, religious institutions, etc, in New Brunswick and, in 
relevant cases, outside of New Brunswick.  Insofar as the work 
of 'policy wonks' relates to this realm of activity -- expanding the 
base of participating organizations/public-minded interests and, as a 
consequence, participating individuals -- it is quite democratic. 

Since the operative ideal here is citizen participation, and alot of 
citizen participation involves indirect participation through the 
institutions of "civil society", it has to be established 1) what the 
goal is and 2) how the institutions of civil society will be either 
worked with or fostered by the city council -- and, how public funds 
and resources at the county, state, or federal level will be 
utilized.  Since we're only at the point of attempting to get three 
city council members elected, this is particularly important.  The 
alternative to empowering the community through working with and 
fostering 'civil society' is, well, patronage, corruption and 
violence.  So, positing "goals" and how we will begin to pursue them 
consists in putting forward the very terms of that pursuit -- a 
statement of method.

Sounds like a good idea.

Agenda tomorrow - 99 Bayard Street building is going to be included in the redevelopment plan.  

I havent been tracking planning since I moved over to education.  Heldrich Plaza is not up for approval this time either, although it might be wise to go to the meeting and ask why the City didnt apply for funds for relocation of residents (the answer Glen Patterson gave me is that the residents didnt qualify as permanent residents since they are technically living in a hotel).  It seems like there is a chance that Dev Co could be classified as a private agency - in that case, they should give residents 18 months before eviction (Legal Services opinion).  If they are classified as a govt entity - just 3 months are required I believe and they are operating under this - and in this case I believe that Dev Co is the designated redeveloper, although I wnated to confirm that with Mr. Clarke of the NB Housing Authority, the redevelopment authority of New Brunswick.  Designated redevelopers must apply to NBHA for approval. Anyway because of this hotel status the City (Or NBHA or DevCO, I am not certain which) applied for relocation funds from the state ONLY for the businesses and for the residents NOT living in the hotel.   If the residents had been classified otherwise (Im not certain how much leeway there is in interpreting this by the state and by the city) or if the City had chosen to think of the residents  otherwise we could have gotten state funds to assist the residents, and a law protecting them requiring that their relocated housing is at least comparable would have applied.  

I know Keith has been working with the residents.  It might be worth going to the pb mtg with the residents tomorrow to demand more information (acquiese that the 18 mth eviction rule applies) , relocation funds, etc..  Also someone might want to check with Jose Abreu at Legal Services to determine DevCos official status, the status of the legal battle at this point and see if theres any way people can go at this as a group rather than individually, legally.

Residents wonder: Where can we go?

Published in the Home News Tribune 7/09/00

By JAKE STUIVER
STAFF WRITER

Once, it was a jewel of downtown New Brunswick.

Gov. Morgan F. Larson was its first guest in 1929, and the top-floor

penthouse of the building originally known as The Woodrow Wilson
Hotel held 
the city's most swinging parties and prestigious events.

Now, human corpses, stairwell feces, rotting food, 3-month-old
beer empties, 
rats and mice are the main attractions at the Monument Park Hotel.
That, and 
a group of residents teetering on homelessness.

After numerous highs and lows and changes in name and ownership
over the 
past 70 years, the eight-story building at 10 Livingston Ave.
is a few 
months away from becoming rubble.

Its new owner, the New Brunswick Development Corp., wants to
make way for 
the 15-story Heldrich Plaza hotel and conference center that
would cover the 
entire block.

The problem is, the hotel isn't exactly a hotel anymore. That
is, its 
patrons usually don't check out the next day. Some of them haven't
checked 
out for more than 10 years.

Many of the 50 or 60 residents and families still living at the
hotel are 
there because of the relatively low living costs (usually about
$800 a month 
and no utility expenses) and the fact that they were placed there
by social 
services.

Add that to the 245-unit housing project down the street also
slated for 
demolition by year's end for another redevelopment plan, and
the city's 
poorest residents are all scrambling to find new places to live.

DevCo acquired the hotel for $2.7 million through bankruptcy
court May 1 
after its prior owner, Donald Cresitello of Morristown-based
Tello 
Enterprises, failed to restore the business to its early glory
and ran into 
financial problems.

Within a week, a foul stench led the new owners to a dead body
that had 
allegedly been sitting in one of the rooms since at least a few
days prior 
to the property transfer. Another tenant's corpse turned up a
few weeks 
later in a bizarre incident with a prostitute.

Though Cresitello denies it, representatives of DevCo and the
firm hired to 
manage the site until demolition claim he pulled out all the
phone wires, 
and they invested in restoring service to tenants.

While many residents are looking for new homes, they're grumbling
that as 
long as they pay rent at the hotel, they're entitled to have
somebody clean 
up the hallways and stairwells, which are full of trash and,
in some places, 
human waste.

Until last week, when reporters began inquiring about the hotel's
condition, 
the bar and basement were covered in food and glass empties from
a party 
residents said the former managers had before they cleared out
in May.

Some of the residents, including fifth-floor tenant Glenda Reaves,
said they 
feel like the owners are trying to give them incentives to leave
quickly.

"That is an absurd out-and-out lie," said Mitch Broder of One-Zero
Hotel 
Management and Raritan Property Management, the firm DevCo hired
to run the 
building. "To the contrary, we've bent over backward to be as
accommodating 
as we can . . . to respond to any requests. We've turned on phones
for 
people that we know are imminently moving, at huge expense for
us. We have a 
full-time cleaning person cleaning the building. We have an exterminator.

We've upgraded fire and electrical systems."

The messes in the halls and stairwells, Broder said, should have
been 
brought to his attention instead of to the press.

New Jersey hotels face inspection, overseen by the state Department
of 
Community Affairs, every five years. As long as the building
is still 
standing and operational, it's subject to health and fire standards,
DCA 
spokesman John Patella said.

The Monument Park Hotel's demolition is targeted for October.
Its next 
inspection is due in September.


Moving the poor
Residents in the nearby New Brunswick Homes public housing are
slowly 
getting out.

Some are finding affordable housing in the area. Others are hoping
the city 
keeps promises for spots in the new low-income units planned
for the site 
and other locations downtown.

Being public-housing tenants, however, can mean expedited Section
8 vouchers 
and other assistance that the hotel tenants won't get.

There's nothing Middlesex County can offer the tenants other
than its 
standard homeless services such as rental assistance, said county
Freeholder 
Jane Brady, chair of the Human Services Committee.

The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development focuses
on family 
units, but there's also a need for what's known as single-room
occupancy, 
she said.

"The problem is that there is just nothing out there for these
people," she 
said. "They are looking for very low-income places to
live, and there just isn't any in this county. It is very disturbing
that we 
are losing what was our last remaining single-room-occupancy
unit."

The city plans to build low-income units at George Street and
Remsen Avenue 
and in the soon-to-be-replaced Lord Stirling School, but those
would go to 
Homes residents first, Mayor Jim Cahill said. Anything left after
all the 
Homes residents are moved could go to former hotel residents
if they 
qualify, he said.

Issues such as transportation, proximity to work and social services
make it 
desirable for the residents to stay in the city, but most options
would be 
better than living at the hotel, the mayor said.

"The hotel has not been well run, it has not been well managed,"
he said, 
adding many people have been moving out on their own. "As these
numbers 
dwindle, it becomes easier to focus on the remaining residents."

Residents are organizing to learn and demand their rights.

A new group in the city called Advocates to Empower the Poor,
headed by the 
formerly homeless Victor Luna, has been working to rally tenants
and get 
them legal counseling.

A few hotel residents, such as Debra Key, have taken matters
into their own 
hands by holding tenant meetings and consulting with Middlesex
County Legal 
Services Corp.

Jose Abreu, a staff attorney with Legal Services' housing unit
who's been 
working closely with tenants at the hotel, said he's encouraging
them to 
challenge the notices to move out.

The notices were issued in May with July 31 deadlines, but that
might not be 
adequate, Abreu said. He said he considers DevCo a private entity
that must 
provide 18 months' notice.

Even if a judge deems DevCo a government agency, which needs
to give only 
three months' notice, the letters contain no language about the
type of 
mandatory relocation assistance the owner will provide, he said.

The residents don't have money to put down for moving costs and
security 
deposits, and they're entitled to aid from the landlord
casting them out, he said.

The management should also offer help finding new homes, considering
the 
low-rent housing market is so saturated with Homes and hotel
residents 
pouring out simultaneously, he said.

Residents have been getting varying amounts of money as part
of their 
agreements to leave.

"The only thing they've offered us is moving assistance," Key
said. "Where 
are we going to move to? They're just trying to slide us up under
the door. 
We're just asking for what's right, and they're trying to find
every way 
around it."

Once a Palace
When the New Brunswick Hotel Corp. opened the Woodrow Wilson
in 1929, one 
newspaper headline read "New Brunswick Crowns with Laurel its
$850,000 
Hostelry."

The opening ceremony guest list included U.S. senators and congressmen,

state officials and Rutgers University President John
M. Thomas.

Its suites, which include a bedroom, kitchenette and main area
not much 
bigger than the bathroom, were once touted as the latest in comfort.

Its history is long and winding, but two things are clear: In
1940, it 
underwent the first of many name changes, to the Roger Smith
Hotel; Sometime 
in the 1970s, the hotel began losing clientele, part of a citywide

recession.

Cresitello said he bought the building in 1986 after it had been
closed for 
several years, possibly because of problems with the city.

He said he invested about $7.5 million in renovations and reopened
it as a 
Days Inn in 1988. He said there were problems with the Days Inn
company, and 
in the early '90s he converted to a Howard Johnson's, soon to
become the 
Monument Park Hotel.

"At that point, we took in whatever customers we could take,"
he said. "Some 
were long-term, some were welfare."

Much of the city's revitalization was supposed to happen 10 years
ago, and 
the delay hurt the hotel industry, Cresitello said.

"We just figured the town wasn't ready for us," he said. "We
got caught in 
the stall. We were never fully able to recover from it."

Now that redevelopment's day has come, the main redeveloper sees

Cresitello's failure as DevCo's gold mine.

DevCo wants to raze the entire block between Livingston Avenue
and New 
Street to build the Heldrich Center, which will also house a
Rutgers 
work-force development school and a huge parking garage.

About 75 percent of the block is on the way to DevCo control,
but most of it 
needs to go down before the hotel to make room for the collapse
of the 
taller building, DevCo President Chris Paladino said.

"Getting the hotel was the cornerstone of the acquisition," Paladino
said. 
"Without that, we would not have been able to move forward."

Paladino doesn't expect everybody to be out of the hotel until
September, 
and he said DevCo is doing what it can to help find housing.

He noted, however, that it's still a hotel, not an apartment
building, and 
that its rates aren't exactly poverty-level.

"At $800 a month, people are not homeless," he said. "$800 is
not an 
insignificant amount of money."

He also noted Heldrich will create 500 jobs, plus another 3,000
during 
construction, and will provide training programs to employ people
from the 
area.

Ultimately, DevCo is hoping to restore the block's luster.

On the inside
That doesn't mean much to the Lopez family, having lived on the
hotel's 
fourth floor for the past eight years.

Ceasar Lopez, 26, drives to work at USA Detergents in North Brunswick
but 
stays at the hotel because his 1-year-old son, Ceasar Jr., has
Scimitas 
syndrome and has to see five doctors a month at city hospitals.

His wife, Anna Ramirez, 27, sits by Ceasar Jr. most of the time
to make sure 
his ventilator unit, which takes up one-third of their tiny living
room, 
stays operational.

The couple would love to have a bigger place but can't find one
they can 
afford that's close enough to the hospitals.

When the notice to vacate arrived in May, Lopez was floored.

"It got everybody crazy," he said. "Nobody was expecting that."

Not everybody is as reluctant to leave as Lopez.

For Glenda Reaves, 47, of the fifth floor, the push out the door
marks the 
end of a long, horrible nightmare at Monument Park.

A long-neglected ceiling leak has left her with mice, exposed
asbestos and 
permanently mangled hands.

Condensation from the air conditioner upstairs ate through the
ceiling 
panels right above the center of her main room, and for the 
past two 
summers she's had her floor constantly covered in towels and
bowls.

Once, while she was hanging towels out the bathroom window to
dry, the loose 
frame slammed down on her hands and left her fingers twisted.
She said she's 
suing the former owner.

Reaves said Advocates to Empower the Poor found her a real-estate
company 
that got her into a Hampton Club residence subsidized by her
social-services 
payments, and she's moving there next week, although the hotel's
new 
management has been letting her use a seventh-floor room in the
meantime.

Maybe at her new home, she hopes, she won't have to sleep on
a cot mattress 
on the floor because there'll be room for both her and her 15-year-old

daughter to have separate beds.

"I'm not a dirty person," she said, gesturing toward her makeshift
bedroom 
by the towel pile. "But right now, living for the next day. It's
all I can 
do. I don't want to live like this ever again."

Zofia.
whereas that may be the opinion of the one person you talked to and MCC is 
no Harvard, many people, (especially working class kids who can't afford or 
get into Rutgers) successfully use it as a stepping stone to four year 
colleges. It is supposed to be one of the better county colleges in the

With the mention of community colleges I just wanted to share that discussion.  I was not promoting my own view but relating what someone else had said, since he is not on email.  I guess my point was that we need alot of input to promote policies on education, because together people have the best knowledge about what opportunities there are and could be.

Another idea that Luis had is to turn the library into a real resource for economic and employment development with more computers, and hired staff to teach people how to use them.

Sorry if you got a copy of this. I havent seen it posted yet.

Agenda tomorrow - 99 Bayard Street building is going to be included in the redevelopment plan.  

I havent been tracking planning since I moved over to education.  Heldrich Plaza is not up for approval this time either, although it might be wise to go to the meeting and ask why the City didnt apply for funds for relocation of residents (the answer Glen Patterson gave me is that the residents didnt qualify as permanent residents since they are technically living in a hotel).  It seems like there is a chance that Dev Co could be classified as a private agency - in that case, they should give residents 18 months before eviction (Legal Services opinion).  If they are classified as a govt entity - just 3 months are required I believe and they are operating under this - and in this case I believe that Dev Co is the designated redeveloper, although I wnated to confirm that with Mr. Clarke of the NB Housing Authority, the redevelopment authority of New Brunswick.  Designated redevelopers must apply to NBHA for approval. Anyway because of this hotel status the City (Or NBHA or DevCO, I am not certain which) applied for relocation funds from the state ONLY for the businesses and for the residents NOT living in the hotel.   If the residents had been classified otherwise (Im not certain how much leeway there is in interpreting this by the state and by the city) or if the City had chosen to think of the residents  otherwise we could have gotten state funds to assist the residents, and a law protecting them requiring that their relocated housing is at least comparable would have applied.  

I know Keith has been working with the residents.  It might be worth going to the pb mtg with the residents tomorrow to demand more information (whether that the 18 mth eviction rule applies) , relocation funds, etc..  Also someone might want to check with Jose Abreu at Legal Services to determine DevCos official status, the status of the legal battle at this point and see if theres any way people can go at this as a group rather than individually, legally.

Zofia,

Is that not precisely the point that was raised?  The ethic of a student is
something that needs to be cultivated right out of NBHS -- worst case, it
should be corrected at a county college.  It is hardly the responsibility of
a State university to countermand the shortcomings of public education at
the expense of those who have studied hard their entire lives.

I have two desks, if they're needed; they may well otherwise end up 
at Goodwill.  

There is always the Rutgers surplus store for that sort of thing, 
over on Livingston.  Lots of old tables, desks, chairs.

Im sorry,

I think my comment was misinterpreted.  The point Luis was making is that he felt the preparation offered at MCC was not enough to launch individuals into any real careers.  The reference to playing cards was to underline that students noted the lack of seriousness and intensiveness of the courses of instruction  available to them there.  Of course, one anecdote does not a policy make, but it sheds some light onto what students experience.

July 15th is her birthday, and he is naming the day Sisterhood Day in her memory.  There will be speeches and ice cream.  All are invited to join in the spirit of the day.

2.  At 2 pm back at the office there will be canvass training.  This is a great place to invite new people and become familiar with the campaign - the training is alot of fun with skits etc.

3.  If you know people who are not already involved in the campaign but would like to organize for an elected school board, please, send them my way:  (732) 729-1087.  I am canvassing this weekend and I would love to have people join the committee with me.  This should be a great opportunity to get to know the community and become involved in the most highly identified issue of concern in New Brunswick - community control over children's education.

Subject:BOE sigs
Message:

Hi everybody, Zofia has indicated that she's planning to canvass separately 
for BOE sigs. I think we need to adopt more of a team approach for this 
important operation.

I don't know how this has been decided in tactical committee, but it seems 
to me we have the best chance to get the BOE question on the ballot is to 
incorporate intensive BOE drives into the canvass. We can do this by 
canvassing the verified registered voters, as with the petitions for 
candidacy. I think we should concentrate these votes in the middle class 
areas, and areas that we have recorded as coming out strong for elected BOE 
in past years.

Additionally:

Since the BOE signatories have to be registered voters, recorded by the 
county before the city clerk will approve their sigs, any voters registered 
less than a month before we hand in BOE sigs probably will not be counted as 
registered by the county, much less the city clerk!

Also:

I find that I spend most of my time with people convincing them to become 
supporter households, something I've been very successful with. In doing 
that, I'm concentrating on building political unity with them, convincing 
them to take on the campaign tasks as their own. So I often don't get in the 
BOE sig because there's so much to talk about.

I think that's cause to have some canvassing concentrated on getting these 
sigs. I'll definitely take part in planning the turfs and 
organizing/training on this issue. People, let me know what you think. Paul

Subject:platform as a tool
Message:

a thought i had this morning:

as a campaign, we really need to understand the value of our campaign 
platform. in essence, it is a tool (picture a hammer) that we should start 
using to shape the national and local discourse. we should advirtise our 
platform, we should write about it, send it out all over the country. we 
should soapbox on the street about it. just go down the list, and explain 
each point. i bet people would stop to listen to that.

the platform is our tool; it is the essence of the campaign. left-wing 
intellectuals and academics spend years analyzing the merits of each of our 
policy proposals, but in our case, we're actually trying to get them 
implemented (in my mind, that's the difference between being progressive and 
being a revolutionary!). this is surely UNIQUE, and we should promote it as 
such.

i'm wondering if any effort is being made to contact mainstream and 
left-wing press on the national level to let them know about us. I'm 
thinking we should really step into the leadership; there's this great 
chaotic void in progressive politics. it screams for leadership, and on the 
local level, i think we have some serious claims.

we need national outreach to complement our local outreach. maybe we should 
put together a "flying squadron" of sorts - an active outreach team that can 
travel around, and make our case to the rest of the state/nation/etc. with 
information, written presentations, etc.

any comments? i would like to talk about these things seriously - ie. how 
should we go about doing this in concrete terms. maybe we need to combine 
the media and outreach committees to form a new team?

Message:

The second edition of our campaign newspaper goes to print 
tomorrow.  We should have it in our hands by Thursday.

Congratulations and much thanks to everyone who helped work
on it.  Especially Mike Long who put in many hours laying it
out.  And thanks to Dahlia and Stephanie for pulling through 
at the last minute with a tremendous translation job.  And
of course thanks to everyone else who had any involvement in
this difficult project.

Celebrations are in order.  All are invited to my place this
Friday night for a party.  Tell people who are not on this
list.  

Already we have to think about the next paper, though.  We
worked harder on this paper than the last one.  For the next
one we have to work smarter.  

There's going to be an organizational meeting for the next 
release on Wednesday, July 26, 8 PM at 230 Sandford St, Flr 1.
We are going to decide, amongst other things:

	+ How many pages we want
	+ What issues we need to cover
	+ What information we need from RTK
	+ Who will write what articles
	+ Who will do layout (we need at least two people this time)
	+ Who will take pictures
	+ A schedule for article submission, layout, and 
	  copy-editing

Everyone on the campaign, especially whoever wants to have 
input on the paper is strongly encouraged to attend.  Anybody 
that wants to help work on the paper is encouraged to attend.  
If you cannot make this meeting, but you want to contribute advice or
help out in any way, then please email me, and I will contact you.

The goal is to get the next paper out by the week of 
August 20, 2000.  That gives us ample time to get it right,
but it will only work with everyone's help and input.  

Hope to see you all there.

Jim

I agree.  We also cannot forget the local arena.  We need to explain to local people in how our platform is doable.  I had a gentleman circle two thirds of the platform points for me yesterday and say, I took economics, and it seems to me like your costs will overrun your revenues with this platform.  I explained to him a number of things about New Brunswick and the additional point of self-determination which brings organizers out of the woodwork.  We need to elaborate on how the current plan is feasible - and we have the resources to do this now.  Finally, we also need to present to people how we plan to work with the federal and state governments to put forward our agenda.

Hi everyone, as you may know , we are doing the youth league at wright 
place. we had a very successful canvass last week where we signed up about 
15 parents to come out one Sunday a month to participate. There are a lot of 
kids there. We still need help from anyone who can do it. We are meeting 
Sunday at 2pm at the office, we will have a brief meeting to make signs and 
to plan our day and then we will go over there.
If people can do the canvass at 12, come over after, I think it is in the 
same area this week.

Also,if people can donate the items below or or know someone who does, 
please let me know:

- large and small soccor balls and footballs
- wiffle balls and bats
- arts stuff: markers, crayons, stickers, hand stamps,face paint,paper, 
chalk, poster board,stencils etc
- whistles
- balloons
- the little vest things to wear to differentiate the teams
- cones
- blankets, or sheets
- cups, juice, cooler
-anything else

Tell your friends, it should be lots of fun and I'd like to go out there 
with a strong showing this Sunday. Call me with any questions 732-890-0995
THANKS!!!

Just a reminder to all women interested, the next women's caucus meeting is 
this friday at 7pm at the office. The last meeting was very positive and 
productive, but a little small. We are finalizing the pamphlet of how the 
issues in the platform effect women specifically. Hope to see you there. 
Maybe we will go out afterwards as well...

I think the gentleman who crossed off those platform points was doing the 
work of the city machine. I think we should emphasize how are platform is 
the will of the majority of New Brunswick, and contrast it with the 
unresponsiveness, extreme waste and corruption of the Machine.

The form, the style of government that we're pushing is just as important as 
the content of the platform. We're telling people on the canvass that we 
need them to take democracy into their own hands. That if they relate to the 
issues we're talking about, THE PEOPLE need to take to the streets and visit 
their neighbors and their friends and engage in discussion about what 
democracy is.

I say our job in the campaign is to agitate constantly about what democracy 
is and what it means in New Brunswick.

The following is an excerpt from Milan Kundera's book, "Immortality".  I
found it pertinent to the campaign and in any case, philosophy cloaked in
literature speaks much more clearly to our daily lives than the most
profound explicit theories of sociology, politics, or economics.  Any
comments are appreciated...

--- 

Goethe urged Bettina (in one of his undated letters) to "step out of
herself."  Nowadays we would say that he reproached her for being
egocentric.  But was he justified in doing so?  Wh ofought for the
rebelling Tyrolean mountaineers, for the posthumous fame of Petofi, for
the life of Mieroslawski?  Was it he, or she?  Who was constantly thinking
of others?  Who was always ready for self-sacrifice?

Bettina.  There is no doubt about it.  Yet Goethe's reproach is not
thereby refuted.  For Bettina never stepped out of her self.  No matter
where she went, her self fluttered behind her like a flag.  What inspired
her to fight for Tyrolean mountaineers was not the mountaineers but the
bewitching image of Bettina fighting for the mountaineers.  What drove her
to love Goethe was not Goethe but the seductive image of the child-Bettina
in love with the old poet.

Let us remember her gesture, which I called the gesture of longing for
immortality : first she placed her fingertips to a spot between her
breasts, as if she wanted to point to the very center of what is known as
the self.  Then she flung her arms forward, as if she wanted to transport
that self somewhere far away, to the horizon, to infinity.  The gesture of
longing for immortality knows only two points in space: the self here, the
horizon far in the distance; only two concepts: the absolute that is the
self, and the absolute that is the world.  That gesture has nothing in
common with love, because the other, the fellow creature, the person
between these two poles (the self and the world) is excluded in advance,
ruled out of the game, invisible.

A twenty-year-old youth who joins the Communist Party or, rifle in hand,
goes off to the hills to fight for a band of guerrillas is fascinated by
his own revolutionary image, which distinguishes him from others and makes
him become himself.  It begins with a festering, unsatisfied love for his
self, a self he wants to mark with expressive features and then send (by
the gesture of loging for immortality I have already described) onto the
great stage of history, under the gaze of thousands; and we know from the
example of MYshkin and Nastasia Filipovna how such a keen gaze can make a
soul grow, expand, get bigger and bigger until at last it rises to heaven
like a beautiful, brightly lit airship.

What makes people raise their fists in the air, puts rifles in their
hands, drives them to join struggles for just and unjust causes, is not
reason but a hypertrophied soul.  It is the fuel without which the motor
of history would stop turning and Europe would lie down in the grass and
placidly watch clouds sail across the sky.

Christiane did not suffer from hypertrophy of the soul and did not yearn
to exhibit herself on the great stage of history.  I suspect that she
preferred to lie on her back in the grass and watch the clouds float by.
(I even suspect that she knew happiness at such times, something a person
with a hypertrophied soul dislikes seeing, because he is burning in the
fire of his self and is never happy.)  Romain Rolland, friend of progress
and tears, thus did not hesitate for a moment when he had to choose
between her and Bettina.

Subject:Re: [nbpeoplescampaign] platform as a tool
Message:

hey paul,

i think there's a component of this discussion that you're not seeing. i 
wouldn't necessarily write off this man's comments by saying he's "doing the 
work of the machine". maybe he is. or maybe he's just an economist (a 
scientist), whose first impulse when looking at a platform of policy 
proposals is to say "how are we going to pay for this?"

yes, the focus in on people's democracy, YET we can't ignore our 
responsibility to take the issues of the platform to the next level by 
examining HOW we're going to begin to get these things. if we don't have a 
plan about how we will start to attain these things we will look very 
foolish. why? because responding "this is the will of the people" may be the 
truth, but they (the people) will be looking to us to help them get these 
things going. i'm not saying change our demands because they are not 
economically feasible AT ALL. my point is that we need to provide an 
alternative plan to the current flow of revenues and expenditures (to be 
specific). we must be clear on every point int he platform, and have some 
kind of initial PLAN as to how we want to get it working...

doing this does not contradict the emphasis on people's democracy.

i don't know if my above explanation is clear, so here's a hypothetical: if 
someone responded to me when i was trying to canvass them the same way that 
that man responded to zofia, then why not respond, "well, yes, according to 
way the budget is currently constructed we can't afford these things. why? 
well, we don't collect nearly any of the property taxes we should be getting 
from J&J, RWJ, etc., which really cuts into the city's revenues. however, by 
demanding that all businesses be taxed equally (eliminating corportate tax 
breaks), there might just be a surplus, through which we could begin to 
finance all of the programs proposed by the campaign...."

i hope that example clarifies my point.

peace,
kristina

Yes, I'm fully aware of the real budgetary and policy aspects which guide

Subject:The platform as a large stone tablet given to us from "Above".
Message:

(I shouldn't but it seems I'm a sucker for this argument)

Kristina is totally on the ball here, no one is saying
snip the platform to bits.  No one is saying we should
circle platform points to cross them out, however I
think circling platform points is a good idea.  I think
questioning the platform SHOULD be encouraged.  This
is NOT the end all.  It IS a work in progress.

HORT-CIRCUITING INITIATIVE.  

What does this even mean?  Paul, there is no conspiracy.  
Or maybe I want you to believe that.  Maybe I work for the
machine, eh?  Now what?

Paul, there is no conspiracy.  

You are not only tossing this out in the air but your backing
for the argument is inane: "Well, they say we don't have
information, but they don't have any either."

This is getting tiresome very quickly.

If you wish to regard the platform as some holy document
etched in stone, hell, I certainly can't stop you.  But
I think it's a mistake.

Message:

Furthermore, to say that the platform is unquestionably the "will of the
people" is the height of arrogance, to say the least.  What percentage of
the population has reviewed the surveys from which the platform was
constructed?  And, furthermore, who chose the questions on those surveys?  

It is precisely this sort of "tendency in the campaign" that led me to
post the Kundera quote.  Let us not get drunk on our preconceived notions
of what the "will of the people" might be based on the surveys and the
vote at the convention alone. (I might ask what percentage of the
community turned out for the convention, as to the latter -- the will
of campaign activists is not synonymous with the will of the people.) The
phrase itself and particularly the context and substance behind it might
as well serve Ceaucescu's Romania as the People's Campaign.  Is that the
sort of imagery we wish to condone?

Paul, I wonder why you changed the name of the thread.  Are you perhaps
becoming flustered at this discussion, and the title is your fashion of
alerting your stalwart comrades to the usurpation of the will of the

Face-to-face interaction is undoubtedly very useful to you, as it ensures
that no one else but the immediate participants of the "face to face"
discussion will catch a glimpse of the idiosyncracies of your argument.
No thanks, let us have the conversation on neutral ground, not at your
house on Saturday.  That is the purpose of the mailing list.

"Years of experience and lots of mistakes is very instructive for our
campaign. "

Whose experience, whose mistakes?  Whose campaign?  Mind clearing that up?
I find it intriguing how the implication here is that in your mind,
your involvement with NJFO is synonymous with the People's Campaign, and
the campaign is synonymous with the will of the people.  If you  think
drawing this implication is far-fetched, please be more explicit when you
say "experience, mistakes, campaign".  

"It's not an accident that experienced canvassers are reporting around 50%
interest of residents in becoming a supporter household in one form or
another.  We've agitated for many years, and now we're learning at an
astronomical rate, by doing it for real...."

What does this mean?  I am attempting to understand you, Paul, I read your
words many times now.  I simply don't understand how it is in any respect
salient to the subject that has been discussed. 

Why does it matter how many years you have been agitated, err, agitating?
The difference between agitation and a campaign is that you are no longer
trying to simply throw mud at the establishment's platform.  It is your
responsibility to come up with an alternative -- a functional alternative,
not something that merely sounds good and earns the support of 50% of the
households.  It does in fact take more than that to effect change, and it
certainly takes more than that to get elected.  Wait until the first
debate and see how little years of agitating contribute to your success in
that.

I think anybody who treats a resident of this community, 
offering constructive criticism on the platform, as a traitor to the 
campaign is himself a tool of the machine.  

I think anybody who generalizes our platform as the "will of
the majority," as if this were some reified, immalleable
concept, and then procedes to attack others for disagreeing
with it, is entirely simple-minded and authoritarian.

I think anybody who does not get the idea that we are running
a serious electoral campaign and continues to think we can win
based upon rhetoric is himself very unresponsiveness.  He is
himself very wasteful.  He is what some might call God's Prize Oaf.

Well.  How about that?

Well, it's not entirely unique -- but that's probably a good thing.  
There are other efforts out there similar to the NB Peoples'
Campaign. 
The point is to demonstrate that the Campaign is part of a general 
trend, tendency, or movement (either the narrow or broad sense of 
'movement').  Not to say that the Campaign might not prove to be 
unique in a variety of ways.  But it's not alone, and that's 
important.

I'm 

I know this has been at least mentioned within the media committee, 
though until very recently time was being monopolized for the final 
stages of production for the newspaper.  

Things are particularly ripe right now in the Left media for 
potentially getting a little attention here or there, say in The 
Progressive, Mother Jones, In These Times, maybe The Nation.  
Something like that.  There's web magazines, of course.  I do not 
doubt that quite a number of such publications will be doing features 
on "Third Party Politics", in which some mention of the Campaign
might 
be possible.  There are unions too, of course, and other
organizations 
with internal publications -- I'd imagine UNITE has some sort of 
magazine or newsletter that it distributes to its members.  Besides 
courting the attention of journalists, we can always submit things 
ourselves, of course.  This, of course, requires time and manpower.

Well, the problem may be that there's not enough opportunities for 
members of any and all committees (and perhaps members of the general 
public as well) to have discussions face-to-face in an organized 
fashion.

Subject:childcare at Gen. mtg
Message:

Hi all

Since we never decided which committee would do childcare this month, and 
instead of taking a committee completely out of the meeeting, I thought I 
would try to get volunteers to do childcare this Saturday. We  can do shifts 
of one hour (2-3, 3-4, 4-5) so no one misses the entire meeting. I really 
encourage everyone to do this, otherwise I will have to pick volunteers

Dear Mr./Ms. Chimuranga,

We are always glad to answer any question about the 
People's Campaign. I will try to address all the points 
you have raised to your satisfaction.

The People's Campaign is a multinational coalition 
fighting for democracy in New Brunswick. Our campaign is 
based on a platform which was developed by 1,000 New 
Brunswick residents whom we surveyed door-to-door all 
over New Brunswick from the Memorial Homes to College 
Avenue and from Remsen Avenue to Wright Place. The 17 
points on our platform were all rated "very important" 
in the surveys. We have embraced this plaform developed 
by the people and we promote it in all neighborhoods 
throughout the city. The People's Campaign platform was 
debated, amended and voted on at the People's Convention 
which we held on May 13, 2000 at Paul Robeson School. 
Over 150 people attended throughout the day, 
representing in fairly equal numbers the Afro-American 
community, the Latino community, and the Euro-American 
community.  

Our volunteers come from all neighborhoods and each 
chooses their own way to work for the campaign based on 
the time they can spare. Close to one hundred homes have 
already signed up as People First Houses: they register 
everyone in their home to vote and distribute campaign 
literature on their block. Many of our door-to-door 
canvassers are young people who do not have yet family 
responsibilities and have more free time to commit to 
the campaign.  

We promote democracy and we practice democracy. Not 
everyone in the Campaign agrees with every point on the 
platform but we all unite to promote it because we 
respect the democratic majority decision of the people 
of New Brunswick as expressed by the 1,000 surveys and 
as was voted on unanimously by 150 participants at our 
convention. Within the Campaign, we openly debate and 
dicuss all disagreements and decide on all issues by 
majority vote.    

(2) IT IS FULL OF PROGRAMS  MAKES THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE US 
MORE 
> DEPENDENT ON YOUR PROGRAMS AS OPPOSED TO DOING FOR 
SELF LIKE WE  AS A 
> PEOPLE NEED TO DO......(

The Platform is not a list of promises but a guide to 
action for everyone in the city to gain their democratic 
rights. We struggle for community control. Every point 
on the platform stresses that the people of New 
Brunswick themselves must take charge of all programs in 
the city which are rightfully theirs since they pay for 
all of them with their taxes. Not a single point on the 
platform will be won without a committed struggle by the 
whole community. Not a single point aims to make 
anyone "dependent" on the city authorities as is the 
case today since the people of New Brunswick currently 
have no say over education, development, police conduct, 
etc. We demand that ALL positions in the city be 
elected, from the School Board to the Planning board. 
That is why one of our slogans is: Unite, Organize, 
Seize Power!

3) WHY DO WE NEVER HEAR FROM  THE PEOPLE WHO 
> YOU HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE  IN TO LEAD US? 

Our 3 candidates, Curtis Warren, Keith Joseph and Diego 
Morales, were chosen out of a field of seven at the 
People's Convention on May 13. They have spoken at a 
number of public events in the past months. Since the 
People's Campaign does not have the backing of big 
corporations and developers (as does the city machine), 
it takes us a little more time to get to everyone, which 
is why we began to campaign early. Curtis, Keith and 
Diego have now cleared up their schedules and will be 
going door to door throughout New Brunswick for the next 
three months (a commitment which I seriously doubt any 
of the current City machine incumbents would even 
consider). 

(4) WHERE DID THIS GUY 
> DIEGO COME FROM ? FORM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE LATINO 
SISTER DANNY WAS 
> SELECTED AT YOUR CONVENTION?   DID YOU GET RID OF HER? 
IS THIS THE 
> TYPE OF DEMOCRACY THAT YOUR GROUP PROMOTES..?    

Danny Rosado was indeed chosen at the People's 
Convention as one of our three candidates. To our great 
dismay, she found out a week later that she was not 
eligible to run because her naturalization process would 
not be completed by the June 6 deadline when candidates 
must file their petitions. The democratically elected 
Steering Committee of the Campaign quickly selected the 
next eligible candidate from the Convention who was 
Diego Morales. Danny remains on the Steering Committee 
of the campaign and was elected president of the Latino 
Committee. All of this information was made available 
immediately on the e-group and throughout the Campaign. 
All of us have told Danny that we count on her to be a 
People's Campaign candidate for the next City Council 
elections in two years. 

Diego Morales has taken his responsibilities as a 
candidate very seriously and proven his leadership by 
helping to rally the people of New Brunswick with a 
rousing speech at the last meeting of the Board of 
Education, bringing about the defeat of the city 
machine's criminally neglectful proposal to fire all pre-
K union teachers and pack the city's youngest children 
in trailers by the High School. More Information on 
Diego, Curtis and Keith is available in the latest issue 
of the People's Campaign newspaper currently being 
distributed all over the city.

I am glad to see we agree that we want Mayor Cahill out. 
Mr. Cook, unfortunately, has decided to run with Mayor 
Cahill and all of his accomplices. He did not oppose the 
city machine throughout his term as a councilman and 
didn't even publicly speak out against the widespread 
police corruption recently exposed in the Home News, or 
the Board of Education's anti-children policies, or the 
massive expulsion of Public Housing residents (at 
Memorial Homes and Monument Park Hotel) from the city, 
or the simple fact that New Brunswick does not have a 
public pool. In fact, Mr. Cook didn't say much of  
anything about the city until the People's Campaign 
began to organize and he rushed to speak out against us 
without ever talking to us. If you can tell us anything 
at all about the "hell" of a job he is doing, please do. 
Until then, to the question: "WHO is Jimmy Cook working 
for and WHO do they give hell to?", we answer: he works 
for the city machine that gives hell to the great 
majority of the people of New Brunswick. 

I hope these answers begin to address your questions. I 
encourage you to attend our next general meeting on 
Saturday August 19 at 2PM at the New Brunswick Library 
so that we may further discuss the task at hand which is 
to organize all residents to defeat the city machine 
that violates all of our democratic rights in their vain 
attempt to hold on to all power forever.

In unity, 

Xavier Hansen
Campaign Manager

Mr./Ms. Chimuranga,

I cannot count the number of people whom I have surveyed who have told me that they support the campaign but a) are afraid of the repercussions of participating or b) have no hope that these folks can be routed, after 25 years of bad experiences and losses and blatant racism and classism since the lost Save Our City Campaign in the 1970's.   I am white and I have had numerous people of color and white people, both men and women tell me, that its fine for me to be identified with the campaign, but they fear they would be killed (!)  One man said, where do you live?  I live in Schwartz Robeson, and I am not protected here.  Whether this would happen or not it gives you an idea of the degree of disenfranchisement in this town.  To give you a concept of the level of daring this reaches, a prominent white middle class, well connected and successful political challenger had her family threatened and she had to withdraw from the political scene.

OK, my level of frustration with this issue is high, so heres another note.  Yes, we would love more people to come out with us on the streets and be seen supporting us.  I was over at Wright Place-Schwartz Robeson THIS SUNDAY and spoke with a fantastic women who earnestly assured me of her support.  I quote almost verbatim:

"I have a city job so I cannot be seen supporting you.  You know, these jobs are political.  But I support you completely.  The only place where they can't see me is the polls. And I will vote for you there."

I was trying to figure out a way with her so she could be protected and more than just a bystander in the campaigning process - perhaps we could drop off newspapers and she could pass them around to friends without anyone noticing.  This all starts to remind me of the days when my dad and I smuggled books into Poland with different covers and my relatives would write what they really meant inside the folds of our Christmas cards.  That is what this town is - there is no democracy here.

I told her, well, once we gain momentum it will become safer and then perhaps you can come out.  She agreed but hesitantly - b/c it may never be safe enough for her.

Am I upset at this situation?  Hell, yes!

Message:

For the record, one woman I surveyed by Ward had tried to pursue the state welfare reform program WorkFirst that requires people to work for their public asistance.  She had no car, and the affordable childcare was poor quality and far from the home.  She said when she was working for WorkFirst she would have to leave the house around 5am in the morning, to walk her 3 young children (I would say 1, 3, and 5 yrs old) across town to catch a bus to childcare which was in a different town and of poor quality, before even getting to work.  The situation was untenable.  She had to give up the work.  Childcare for all residents, Improved public transportation means people can become financially independent. This is about BREAKING the bonds of dependency, for women in particular.   At this point the city is planning to spend an inflow of public transportation funds from the state/Fed on Rutgers students and commuters to NYC.  NO RECOGNITION that there are other people living in New Brunswick.  I raised this at the City Council meeting one month ago and noone stepped in from the Council to acknowledge this point.  In fact that was this city council meeting where council members were referring to Remsen Ave residents as "the element" responsible for all the litter in the town and Jimmie Cook did not contradict that statement.  It took the business administrator to step in and say something.  The topic of the day was litter cleanup education for the children of "the element" and Jimmie Cook said this was his top priority.  Check the minutes of the meeting.

Mr. CHIMURANGA

I would like to answer some of your questions, I also have a few of my own.
First, no one in our campaign has "demonized" Mr. Cook.  In fact we have never
mentioned him in any of our literature, although we would be happy to debate him and
the other two machine candiadtes as well.

I think that your assessmnet that the platform advcates dependency is just wrong. The
platform was voted on by 150 people and based on one thousand surveys. In fact it is a
program for self-relaince and self-determiantion.  None of the points on the platform
is possible without the full partcipation of the majority of New Brunswick's people.
You have stated twice that you belive otherwise. Could you explain how rent control,
community control over schools and the police is dependency?

You think that Afro-Americans should organize themselves independently and then form
coalitions.  You are entitled to your opinion but I think that the people have
indicated otherwise. We are uniting on principles of equality and mutual respect.  But
since  your opinion diffres,  I would like to know what  your councilman Mr. Cook is
doing to organize the Afro-American community?

No one in our campaign has attacked Rev. Soaries.  In fact, the commmets you refer to
were made in a juvenile tirade against one of our candidates; I guess they didn't tell
you about that.

If I can ask you three quetsions.
1) How come you use a fake e-mail adress?
2) Could you explain what Mr. Cook has done for the people of New Brunswick since he
has been a city councilman?
3) Could you ask Mr. Cook if he and his two friends would like to debate?

Candidate for New Brunswick City Council

From: 	"Sara Hinkley" <shinkley@...>
To:	"Greg LeRoy" <goodjobs@...>
Date: 	7/25/00 6:07PM
Subject: 	Corporate Mobility and Subsidies

As we said two weeks ago, GJF believes that with today's skilled-labor
shortage, there ought to be a  reallocation of development subsidies to
programs that produce more skilled labor --  GED, ESL, Adult Literacy, real
training for workers leaving welfare, and "carrots" for  employers to adopt
high-road practices such as lifelong learning and career ladders.

Now comes massive confirming evidence. Yesterday's New York Times had a long
Page 1 article showing that corporations are relocating *within the U.S.* at
more than twice the rate of just six years ago. It concludes that the
relocations are driven by the companies' quest for more (and cheaper) labor.
Yet despite the fact that the relocations are happening for hard market
reasons, public officials continue to subsidize the "new" facilities. Those
of us in the plant closing movement began decrying this practice 15 years
ago, saying that capital is already very mobile, so it makes no sense to
subsidize even more mobility.

It is one more example of how economic development in American has strayed
from its original intent.  Instead of leveraging investment that would not
occur otherwise, taxpayer dollars are often used to jump the parade of
market trends. Public officials, of course, love those
parade-marshal uniforms!

SHIFTING WORKPLACE
A special report.
A New Corporate Wanderlust Puts a Quiet Brake on Salaries
By LOUIS UCHITELLE

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Not long after W. Lee Nutter took over last year as
chairman of Rayonier Inc., a big wood and pulp company with headquarters in
Stamford, Conn., he called in a top executive, Jack O'Grady, and asked, "Why
are we here?"

The reasons, in fact, had peeled away. Modern technology now allowed the
company to distance itself from New York's financial markets and still have
complete instant communications. More of Rayonier's timberland and mills
were in the Southeast, and Jacksonville beckoned with $2.7 million in public
subsidies. And, in a booming economy, managers and executives were
increasingly expensive. Moving to an office tower here this summer cut
executive labor costs.

Twenty-eight people transferred from Stamford, but others declined to
relocate and 44 men and women, mostly executives, are being hired locally at
salaries that are at least 10 percent lower, on average, than those paid in
Stamford. In relocating, Rayonier shrank the headquarters staff to 72 from
85. And the new executives expect less. "Salaries in the Southeast do rise
more slowly than in the Northeast," said Mr. O'Grady, who is senior vice
president for administration.

Companies have been migrating for decades, of course, moving operations both
within the United States and overseas for many reasons, including the search
for cheaper labor. But since 1996, corporate migration within the country
has soared, roughly doubling to more than 11,000 moves a year, according to
Site Selection Magazine of Atlanta, the only organization, public or
private, to track the phenomenon. At the same time, the emphasis has shifted
from factories, the traditional migrants, to every type of service
operation, and across a range of jobs, from Rayonier's six-figure executives
down to call center operators earning $7 an hour.

The increasing restlessness of American business is beginning to be noticed
by economists, government officials and industry groups. "Corporate
migration within the United States is definitely accelerating," said Allen
J. Scott, a geographer at the University of California at Los Angeles who
specializes in economic issues. "The booming economy is prodding companies
to relocate or expand in new places."

As labor shortages and competition for workers drives up wages in one city,
companies have shifted work or have expanded in another location, where the
same tasks can be done at lower pay. This movement helps to answer one of
the big questions about the recent economy: How has the United States
managed to achieve its lowest unemployment rate since the 1960's and yet not
experience as much upward pressure on wages as it has during past booms,
even when labor markets were not as tight as they are today?

Various explanations have been offered by economists for the failure of
labor shortages to give a bigger kick to wages in the record long expansion
that started in 1991: weaker unions, the greater use of temporary workers, a
minimum wage that has lost value, a flood of immigrant workers, layoffs and
job insecurity, global competition. Often overlooked, however, has been the
impact of the stepped-up rate of corporate migration, which adds another
critical element to the mix.

But if lower labor costs drive the process, technology greases the way.
High-speed telecommunications and fiber-optic lines, now available almost
everywhere in the country, allow a Rayonier to communicate as easily from
Jacksonville as from Stamford, and they also allow a great variety of
service companies to link operations in different cities, as if these
operations were all in one office.

In addition, the talent pool is more evenly spread across the country in the
1990's than in earlier generations, said Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard
economist, meaning "you can find similar labor forces and similar amenities
in many more places in America."

While technology facilitates corporate migration, so does the growing use of
call centers to deal with the public. Many companies use centers to take
orders for merchandise, to service credit cards, to handle securities
transactions, to give investment advice, to help owners of computers solve
software problems, to collect debts, to sell insurance, to help people
navigate the Internet. No one has yet counted all the call center operators,
not even the Labor Department, but their importance is beginning to rival
that of assembly line workers 50 years ago. And call centers, generally
requiring only telephones and desk-top computers, are much more mobile than
factories.

Mid-sized cities in the Southeast and Southwest are prime targets of the
corporate migration, cities like Charlotte, Memphis, Phoenix and
Jacksonville. But companies have also been drawn in growing numbers to the
Midwestern states or to Maine or Pennsylvania or Kentucky -- to any place,
in fact, that offers lower wages and public subsidies. Maine has fewer than
6,000 people making shoes, less than half the number it had in 1985, but
out-of-state retailers, banks, pharmaceutical companies, even a newspaper
clipping service, have placed operations in the old shoe towns, re-employing
workers.

"Companies are searching for pockets of unemployment," said Steven H.
Levesque, commissioner of Maine's Department of Economic and Community
Development, "and Maine has these pockets."


Spreading the Jobs: Mobility Restrains Wage Momentum

he stepped-up corporate migration has spread jobs and living standards more
evenly across the country than in some earlier expansions. Rather than
expand several of its operations in New York or New Jersey, for example,
Merrill Lynch has gradually added 2,000 employees here in Jacksonville,
locating them in four imposing pink stone office buildings on a bucolic site
in a suburban office park.

For a migrating company, the money saved in labor costs often goes into
earnings, helping to explain the extraordinary profitability of American
business in recent years, economists say. And by lowering labor costs,
corporate migration serves to keep inflation under control. But it also
serves as a counterweight to the social benefit of a low unemployment rate.
The ability to move almost any kind of work easily gives employers a more
powerful response to the demands of their employees for greater pay.

"Not just the greater mobility, but the threat of it helps to hold down
wages," Mr. Katz said.

Even so, average hourly earnings have risen faster than inflation in the
boom years since 1996, the first time that has happened for so long a
stretch since the 1960's and early 70's. But compare the 1990's with those
earlier decades and a more complex story emerges. Wages moved up more
persistently in the 60's as the unemployment rate fell. In response, the
inflation rate also rose more in the 60's than it did in the 90's. Corporate
migration has helped, in effect, to hold down labor costs and prices.

Public attention has focused on manufacturers that shift factories abroad,
particularly to Mexico and the Far East. But corporate migration within the
United States, which dawdled along at fewer than 5,200 occurrences annually
from 1980 through 1994, jumped in the late 1990's to more than 11,400,
according to Site Selection's research.

The organization's totals cover not only corporate migrations but also the
initial investments of newly started companies. Because only the largest
start-ups are counted, however, they represent only 10 percent of each
year's total, says Jack Lynes, Site Selection's executive editor. The
totals, including the start-ups, reached 12,702 in 1999. Before 1995, the
high point was 5,686 in 1989, the last full year of the previous expansion.

Responding to a request for data on corporate migration, the American
Management Association polled 63 of its chief executives last month, asking
by e-mail whether they intended to relocate their headquarters. Forty-two
percent said they had either recently relocated or were actively considering
doing so.

"You have to conclude that relocating operations is very much on the agenda
of corporate America," said Eric Greenberg, the association's director of
surveys.

The continuing migration of millions of families to the Sun Belt and the
Mountain States serves as a magnet for many companies. The labor force has
grown more rapidly in these regions than in the Northeast or Midwest. In
Jacksonville, for example, the labor force has been growing at 3 percent a
year since 1990, or three times as fast as the national average.

As a result, skilled executives -- accountants, financial analysts,
personnel managers and computer specialists -- are finally as easy for
Rayonier to find here as they are in the Northeast, Mr. O'Grady says.

"These are people who have moved for the amenities of life," said Edward
Glaeser, a Harvard economist, "and in some long-run sense their wages are
going to be relatively low because they want to be there."

Rayonier is the 19th large company to move an operation to Jacksonville this
year, or expand one here, and the company is still unpacking. Paintings are
propped against a wall in the conference room, waiting to be hung. Potted
plants will also decorate the room, Mr. O'Grady promises, and out in the
lobby the black plastic counter encircling the receptionist's station will
soon be changed for a green marble one, matching the green in the new
carpet.

Rayonier's headquarters had been in Stamford for 20 years and in Manhattan
for 30 years before that. Its new executives in Jacksonville earn $85,000
and up, some as much as $175,000 a year. For that sort of money, Mr. O'Grady
said, the pickings are better and the turnover less.

"You have more people competing for our jobs at this pay range," he said.
And the quality is better. In the Northeast, you get a personnel executive,
for example, with experience only in workmen's compensation, Mr. O'Grady
explained. "Here, for the same pay, they also have experience in medical and
dental insurance and 401(k) plans. You get a broader experience base."

There are other advantages. Office space is cheaper, and because
headquarters is now "closer to the bulk of our operations," Mr. O'Grady
said, fewer executives are needed. The company likes to promote from within,
but getting promising employees to transfer to Stamford was harder and more
expensive than bringing them here is likely to be. Housing costs are less,
the climate milder, and the beaches spectacular. The championship Jaguar
football team also figures as a draw in the Rayonier calculation, Mr.
O'Grady said.

"I have a new condo here," said Mr. O'Grady, who transferred to Jacksonville
himself in the spring, "and I asked my neighbors, 'Where are you from?' and
I would bet 80 percent are from other places."


Have Jobs, Will Travel: More Places Seen as Viable Locales

ompanies that once put down deep roots are also showing up in Colorado,
Idaho, Texas, Nevada, Utah, Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio -- just about everywhere.

But the South is still a favorite. People have been migrating to the South
for more than a generation, and now their children, those raised and
educated in Jacksonville, for example, are everywhere at Merrill Lynch.
William A. Bridy, Merrill's senior director in Jacksonville, often recruits
graduates of the University of North Florida, whose campus, with 12,000
students, is only three miles away. Recent graduates are among the 25
"profilers" stationed at Merrill's suburban campus.

Merrill developed profiling at its Somerset, N.J., office, using the
profilers to build a database of biographical information on new clients for
use as a tool in selling more services. The expansion, seven months ago, was
in Jacksonville and Denver.

Here a profiler's starting wage of $26,000 is 10 to 20 percent less than in
New Jersey, Mr. Bridy said. "There is not the demand for New Jersey wages,"
he said, adding that if labor costs do rise, Jacksonville will become less
attractive. That is beginning to happen in Denver. "The problem you have
there is turnover, which is higher than Jacksonville," Mr. Bridy said.

Sometimes the corporate migration is only a few counties away. Pressed by
the Big Three automakers to hold down prices, some parts manufacturers are
shifting from the Detroit environs to Traverse City and other locations in
upstate Michigan, where wages are lower. Principal Financial Group, which
manages pension plans for thousands of companies, found that wages were
rising in Des Moines, its headquarters city, for the counselors who field
telephone calls from people seeking information about their plans or
shifting investments. So work has been moved, through computer links, to
offices in Waterloo and Ottumwa, Iowa, where wages for counselors with the
same skills are 5 to 10 percent lower than in Des Moines.

Burrelle's Information Services is a constant migrant. The company employs
nearly 2,000 people who cull newspaper, magazine, video and Internet
citations for corporate customers. As wages rose in Livingston, N.J., its
headquarters, and business grew, the company added an office in Salt Lake
City, then Presque Isle, Me., and most recently in Houlton, Me. -- all in a
successful effort to keep the hourly wage of most of the employees below
$10.

"The unemployment rate is a little higher in Houlton than in Presque Isle
because it does not have an airport and tends to be bypassed by other
companies," said Robert Waggoner, chief executive at Burrelle's. "You have
to be adventurous in finding new places."


Vying for Better Jobs: Towns Try to Draw the Better Wages

hile Maine, with an unemployment rate of 5 percent or more in many towns and
cities, vies to attract lower-wage jobs -- or any jobs -- Jacksonville is
taking a different tack. The unemployment rate here has fallen to 3.1
percent from 6.6 percent in 1992, and with the pressure reduced to bring in
jobs, whatever they pay, the Chamber of Commerce and the Economic
Development Commission are trying to attract companies with jobs that pay
more than $31,000.

Boeing, the aerospace giant, is one beneficiary. Servicing and overhauling
aircraft is a growing part of its business, but rather than expand repair
centers in Wichita, Seattle or St. Louis, where mechanics earn $20 an hour
and up, Boeing has opened a center in Jacksonville. So have Northrop Grumman
and Jet Turbine Services. Skilled mechanics, trained in the Navy and
mustering out here, sign on for $18 an hour or less.

"You go where the workers are," said Dee Burcham, manager of Boeing's
Jacksonville repair center.

The Navy has a big presence in Jacksonville, but part of its complex, Cecil
Field, an air station, was closed and turned over to the city last fall. Now
the city is leasing hangar space to Boeing and others for the give-away
price of $1.50 a square foot.

"We are pump priming," said Paul Krutko, a director of the Economic
Development Commission. "Later the rates will go up."

Mr. Beecham, the Boeing manager, whose 55 employees will rise to 120 by
January, acknowledges that Cecil Field's subsidized facilities were an
important lure. "All we had to do was organize a work force and we were up
and running," he said. But he gave equal billing to "the availability of
knowledgeable aviation mechanics and electricians" at $18 an hour or less.

They are people like Michael Zipp, 39, who trained in the Marines as an
aviation electrician. He joined Grumman in Bethpage, N.Y., in the early
1980's, long before its merger with Northrop. Earning $17.50 an hour, with a
wife and four children, he could not make ends meet on Long Island, he said.
So he quit in 1988, moved himself and his family to nearby St. Augustine,
where Grumman had an operation, and rejoined the company at $10 an hour.

Even at that lower wage, he says, he could finally afford to pay his bills
and, for the first time, purchase a home. Only now, more than a decade
later, has his wage risen back to its old level of $17.50 an hour. He is
aware that people with his skills earn more elsewhere in the country. The
starting wage in Wichita, for example, where Boeing also has operations, is
$25 an hour, he says.

Why not move? "I'm settled here," he said.


Son of Call Center: Jacksonville Chafes at Label, and Jobs

acksonville got its start in economic development as a mecca for call
centers, thanks to AT&T, which set up a center here in 1983, after the phone
company's breakup, to handle queries from shareholders whose stock was
split. Inexpensive land drew more call centers, and Florida's status as a
largely nonunion, right to work state.

Public subsidies also helped. They still do, although they are angled now
toward companies like Boeing and Rayonier, which is receiving from the city
a $1.8 billion cash grant for bringing its headquarters here and additional
"incentives," as Mr. O'Grady calls them, from the state government.

But for all the efforts of the city fathers to bring higher paying jobs to
Jacksonville, the call centers still play a dominant role. America Online,
Citibank, Bank of America, MediaOne all have a big presence here. "We have
gone from being a call center town to wanting to not be called a call center
town," said Faye Kullberg, director of human resources for MediaOne.

Few companies employ more people here than a descendant of the original AT&T
call center, now part of a company called Convergys, based in Cincinnati.
Convergys has 37 call centers nationwide, with 45,000 employees, including
4,500 here. The operators do not mention Convergys; they take on the
identity of the companies that purchase its services. A recent client is
AT&T Wireless, whose cell phone customers get a Convergys operator when they
call an 800 number for help.

But Convergys has not expanded recently in Jacksonville. The pay for call
center operators has risen by about $2 an hour in the last 18 months, to
between $10 and $12 an hour. Turnover is also rising, and Jacksonville is
losing its luster as a suitable site for low-wage call centers. So Convergys
opened its newest center in Brownsville, Tex.

"We pay the same in Brownsville as in Jacksonville," said Frank Kelly, a
Convergys executive, "but the unemployment rate there reached 14 percent,
and we were able to hire very good people. They consider our job to be a
white collar job."

Subject: 	Subsidies: Eroding State Revenues?

A  recent report by the Congressional Research Service suggests that the
"economic war among the states" is causing state corporate income tax rates
to plummet. The report, attached here, documents the fact that the effective
rate of state and local taxes on corporate profits averaged 6.5% in the
1980s, but dropped to an average of 4.9% between 1990 and 1998, and stood at
just 3.8% in 1998 -- or a drop in the effective rate of more than 41%
comparing the 1980s to 1998.

Although the report does not explore the cause or causes of this sharp
decline, it concludes that "[p]erhaps the most obvious explanation is the
tax competition among states to attract businesses." As a major source of
the decline, it cites the increasingly common state practice of abandoning
the traditional three-factor formula for allocating profits for taxation
(equally weighting jobs, assets and sales in the state) and either
double-weighting sales or allocating taxes based entirely on sales. Such
changes are often demanded by large manufacturing companies which have large
asset bases and large workforces in a state, but sell
nationally/internationally. The net effect is to greatly reduce their state
corporate income taxes.

The CRS finding is consistent with other observers who have noted that after
many federal corporate income tax loopholes were closed in 1986, and after
federal rates were raised in 1993, many corporations turned their
tax-cutting energies to the states. There, they discovered that by packaging
corporate tax cuts as "economic development," they could play states against
each other and win cuts no longer available from Uncle Sam.

Corporate income taxes make up only about 7% of state tax revenues. Due to
robust growth in personal income, the erosion in corporate tax rates has
been masked in most states. But corporate income tax revenues are quite
volatile and are more sensitive to the business cycle than most other
sources. So the next recession may only further reduce the share of state
revenues coming from corporate profits.

Hi everyone.

The first Sunday of Youth League went great! We played soccer and football, 
papermached balloons (thanks Alyssa!)and made posters with about 35 kids. It 
was a lot of fun, we had many kids involved with creative ideas of what they 
want to do in the league. Thank you to all our volunteers who came out.

I am emailing everyone to remind them that we are doing it every Sunday for 
six weeks. We meet at 2pm at 149 Redmond st (go around back) to discuss the 
previous week, what could be done better and to plan activities for the 
upcoming week, then we all go over to the field. If you canvass from 12-2 
(which is very much encouraged) you can meet up with us at 245 at the field, 
call me for directions.

Please call me or email me with any questions 732-890-0995. I hope to see 
you all there this week, we really need people since many will be out of 
town.

Also, we still need art supplies if you got them and does anyone know of a 
good place to get a wiffle ball and bat, walmart was a no go.

Thanks

People I am speaking with are concerned that not enough people will go to vote in the spring.  Moving the date to November would make it easier for voters and would guarantee greater representation, and a coalition could be organized to move the day.  Of course, we should work towards election days being off for folks because so many have to work.
The point is to jointly with the BOE issue address any attacks on voters that make the election process more difficult., since the BOE will be a bigger win for true democracy that way. 

If the fiscal year makes it a challenge, others who have called for this must have thought of this and found a way to address it - I will have to look into it.

I think so much of the history of New Brunswick has been about the struggle for representation because of harsh disenfranchisement of different groups, and the real necessity of clutching onto any and all wins made in this area.  What we are struggling with is the confusion of representation which has been able to grant some positive change, in the form of increased jobs going to a few members of those groups, possibly Section 8's, etc., some oversight of the most egregious errors, implementation of some new programs; the confusion of this with the gaining of real power to ensure that conditions in the town change systematically and substantively FOR ALL, not the lucky few recipients within each group, who get the new jobs or program - ie school administration and quality, redevelopment, youth activities, housing, etc. etc.  I think many people feel they have struggled so hard to get the representation that they do have at this point, and are afraid to rock the boat because the machine has tolerated this and in fact used it as political patronage, and they do not want any new factor that may shift the resource flows that have developed over time.

I agree that groups should organize themselves.  What you see in our general meetings is groups that have organized themselves formally or informally are able to put forward their proposals - so this step must happen in a sense first.  At the same time, I think that if the group has not yet been organized to perfection those people still need to jump in to the fray in order to influence it, otherwise the opportunity is missed.  And what I am learning in this campaign is also not to compromise ones ultimate goals in order to gain a measure of support.

IN THE EIGHTH CIRCLE OF THIEVES



by E. L. DOCTOROW


Click here for our special election-season website.



Eased into governance
by years and years of conservative ideology, the corporations of America
today effectively oversee the Congress, the regulatory agencies and indeed
the presidency itself. There is no Article in the Constitution that recognizes
the supracitizenship of conglomerates; nothing is written that grants enlarged
and pre-emptive voting rights to business organizations and their trade
groups. But as Washington is run today, major issues of public policy are
bent and distorted by these multiheaded Brobdingnags who bribe Congress
with their money and coddle it with their lobbies, so that time and time
again socially desirable legislation in the public interest, whether having
to do with public health or safety, environmental protection, preservation
of our natural resources or any other issue of clear relevance to the entire
society, is defeated, sabotaged or transmuted by language into its perverse
opposite.

Yes, you say, tell me about it. But this is the recurrent truth
of Washington, so rhythmically repetitive as to be its heartbeat, the way
it pumps. Corporations that pit themselves against the manifest needs of
the American people according to the issues that arise take turns as enemies
of the people. Nothing else on Capitol Hill occurs so reliably and regularly.
It so prevails as a political fact of life that it is hardly news. It has
been a long, long time since it was news. It is now only and obviously the
way things are. Banking, oil, lumber, pharmaceuticals, weaponry, communications
and electronics, chemicals, meat and poultry--whatever the industry, you'll
find it striding with a proprietary mien through the corridors of power.
But in the name of what kind of Constitution?

Apologists will cite the
First Amendment, speak of the American or God-given right of people to function
in their own interest. That is just what democracy is, they say, a raucous
contention of interests that historically proves out as the genius of our
system; it is what we have always done in this country right from the start,
when frontiersmen in coonskin caps and leggings came to town, and later
the men in cutaways and top hats, everyone, always, grabbing their representatives
by the lapels and demanding to be represented.

But conglomerated organizations
of capital are not exactly people. They are compositions of human talents
formatted to their purposes. They are dedicated networks of artificial intelligence.
They think and feel in numerical abstractions. They will advertise their
employees as their human face, they will give themselves hearts and souls
in their television commercials, but as institutions they are dimensionally
beyond the humans who work for them or the shareholders who gamble in their
stock. They transform themselves, take on or divest themselves of companies,
move across national boundaries, restructure, wax and wane, merge with others
of their ilk in an institutionalized dynamic that leaves even their executives
irrelevant. They are profit manufactories that accumulate people or rid
themselves of people according to the transhuman logic of their balance
sheets. And for the loyalty they demand and receive, the quid pro quo is
to absolve those working for them who act inhumanely on their inhuman behalf.
* * *

In effect corporate entities that function in Washington to achieve
benefits for themselves--tax loopholes, contracts, entitlements, dismantling
of regulatory acts--regardless of the overall social effect, pre-empt the
idea of the larger community, the national ideal, the United States as the
ultimate communal reality. A just nation is not envisioned but a confederacy
whose people are meant to live at the expense of one another. Such social
Darwinism finds the presumptions of democracy naïve. The corporations
that will farm our lands, insure our lives and our health, finance our homes,
entertain us, power our cars, light our lamps... ask only one thing in return:
that we recognize two forms of citizenship, common and preferred.

How contemptuous
this all is, what an enormous humiliation to a society of free people. We
may ask those who speak of this corrupt and corrupting system as a kind
of speech that mustn't be tampered with, if to privilege the free speech
of corporations with vast treasuries on those grounds is not undeniably
to squelch the speech of others who don't have the same resources. Or if,
in fact, this huge application of money to the political process that so
depreciates the power of the individual voter is not a de facto poll tax,
with the expected minorities, Afro-American, Hispanic, joined in their disfranchisement
by the white citizenry.

To consider the elected politician in all this
is to mourn the days when amateurism was part of the political culture.
Somewhere along the line political officeholding became a profession. To
keep working, politicians have regularly to come like buskers into the street,
sing their song and dance their jig and hold out their hats. In the best
of them, this ritual has to induce a degree of self-hatred. Television is
the major reason campaigning is so monstrously expensive. The airwaves are
owned by the public, but that is irrelevant to the broadcast licensees,
who charge commercial rates for programming in the public interest... and
then contribute heavily to campaigns, so that no one who is elected will
get up in Congress and say what a swindle it is for the broadcasters to
charge the public for the use of airwaves the public owns.
* * *

The fundraising
dinners are affairs of the wealthy. If you are a politician, the fatter
the check that comes in, the greater your indebtedness. Your conscience
becomes an instrument of self-deception. Some politicians are entirely at
ease with this, either because they are themselves wealthy and are one with
their contributors, or so reliably conformed to the values of the plutocracy
that they rise up fully banked--as for example the Governor of Texas, noted
for his rigorous support for the death penalty and for the civil rights
of heavily polluting industries, who miraculously appeared in all the papers
two years before the primaries as a front-runner and who now floats atop
a campaign fund of $80 million.

What kind of political culture does the
politician cheerfully acknowledge, who can say, as Republican Senator Orrin
Hatch has said, that to back reform of the system of campaign money-raising
would be an idiotic thing for his party because it collects more money than
the opposition? What degree of public alienation can a politician like Senate
majority leader Trent Lott depend on, who has brazenly said in sponsoring
legislation written by corporate lobbyists... that after all they are the
specialists in their field, who know the issues better than anyone else?
These are the remarks of senators confident of a general population so numbed
and alienated that barely 50 percent of eligible adults bother to vote in
national elections. These are the flaunted values of politicians who know
of the conglomerate-owned press culture, that there will be no editorial
muckraking from the "in depth" journalists of the broadcast media, that
the rampant corruption in Washington, the vast, deep and dangerous mutant
character of the present state of things, will not be defined for what it
is, and that who speaks of the bewildering broad front of failure and mendacity
and carelessness of human life in so much of our public policy in tones
any louder than muted regret will be marginalized for this indecorous transgression
as a leftist, a bleeding-heart liberal or perhaps a raging populist, but
in any event someone so out of the "mainstream" as not to be taken seriously.
How many in Congress today have the integrity, the strength, to distinguish
the interests of their districts or their states from the interests of their
heavy donors? How many think there is a difference? How many can honestly
admit to themselves that the big money is their constituency? To hear the
points of view of some of these people, how they have become so much the
forces that have bought them, is to realize they are no longer guilty of
hypocrisy, having been transmogrified.

The instructive image here is from
Dante's Inferno, Canto XXV. We are in a pouch of the Eighth Circle, where
the thieves are kept. A monstrous lizardlike serpent leaps onto one of the
thieves, wraps its middle feet around his belly, pins his two arms with
its forelegs and, wrapping its rear feet around his knees, swings its tail
up between his legs and sinks its teeth into his face. And so intertwined,
monster and thief, they begin to melt into each other like hot wax, their
two heads joining, their substances merging, until a new third creature
is created, though somehow redolent of both of them. And it slowly slithers
away into the darkness.
* * *

Back in 1787, when the Constitutional Convention
had done its work and the drafted Constitution was sent out to the states
for ratification, the public's excitement was palpable. Extended and vigorous
statehouse debates echoed through the towns and villages, and as, one by
one, the states voted to ratify, church bells rang, cheers went up from
the public houses and in the major cities the people turned out to parade
with a fresh new sense of themselves as a nation.

Everyone marched--tradespeople,
workingmen, soldiers, women, clergy. They had floats in those days, too--most
often a wagon-sized ship of state, called the Union, rolling through the
streets with children waving from the scuppers. Philadelphia came up with
a float called the New Roof, a dome supported by thirteen pillars and ornamented
with stars. It was drawn by ten white horses, and at the top was a handsome
cupola surmounted by a figure of Plenty, bearing her cornucopia.

The ratification
parades were sacramental--symbolic venerations, acts of faith. From the
beginning people saw the Constitution as a kind of sacred text for a civil
society. Indeed, the voice of the Constitution is scriptural. It ordains.
It empowers itself to give law endlessly into the future. Like the Bible,
it requires interpretive commentaries that themselves have the authority
of law because its principles must be applied to a multitude of situations.
And where its prophecy has been false, as in the infamous Article IV, which
made a slave in one state a slave in all, the national calamity of a civil
war ensued before the text could be amended.

Today, the Constitution with
its Bill of Rights and further amendments rules us with a set of behavioral
prescriptions that, if we lived up to all of them, would make us a truly
free and righteous people. When the ancient Hebrews broke their covenant
they suffered a loss of identity and brought disaster upon themselves. Our
burden too is unmistakably covenantal. We may point to our 200-some years
of national survival as an open society, constitutionally sworn to a degree
of free imaginative expression that few cultures in the world can tolerate;
we may regard ourselves as an exceptional, historically self-correcting
nation whose democratic values locate us just as surely as our geography...
and yet we know at the same time that all through our history we have brutally
excluded vast numbers of us from the shelter of the New Roof, we have broken
our covenant again and again with a virtuosity verging on damnation and have
been saved only by the sacrificial efforts of Constitution-reverencing patriots
in government and out of government--Presidents, senators, Justices, abolitionists,
muckrakers, suffragists, striking workers, civil rights activists.
 What
is to be done now, when the Constitution is subjected to corporate-groomed politicians
who read it as no more than a postmodern self-deconstructing text? The present
wide-open, scandalous system of campaign financing is rationalized by a
rightist ideology that portrays the federal government as stiflingly bureaucratic,
intrusive and inimical to the natural rights of a free people. In the lifetimes
of many of us the federal government has been just the opposite, a means
of redress, redemptive justice and societal healing, as, for instance, when
it enacted the Depression measures of the thirties and the Great Society
legislation of the sixties. Today the corporate rightists in Congress mean
to privatize the Social Security system, vouch the public school system
out of existence and do whatever they can to limit if not decimate the regulatory
agencies established to control their worst business excesses. By the logic
of their thinking even the National Office of Weights and Measures could
be construed as an impediment to business practices.

It is not that members
of Congress--or indeed the media or the American public--are not aware of
the inequity of the present money-soaked system of political life in our
country. But to what extent that system is responsible for the grotesque
distortions of our present priorities--with the resultant poverty of so
many children; the way our jails proliferate for the incarceration of black
men, with more and more penal systems run privately for profit; the drift
into monopolization of our media and means of communication, with fewer
and fewer mega-corporations controlling more and more of what we read, see,
hear or understand as the news; or the cost of health insurance policies
that insure people until they get sick; the inequitable tax structure; the
international trade agreements that rescind our environmental laws; the
list is long--and how all of this is connected to the system of unrestricted
and flamboyant political donations may not be always appreciated by the
public or acknowledged consistently even by those members of Congress who
have voted to reform the laws of campaign finance.

In fact, campaign finance
reform as a phrase has been bruited about so long and to so little effect
and is so yawningly dull, dreary and unresounding, it makes one wonder if
it's not partly responsible for the conditions it has so far failed to address.
Perhaps there is a basement office somewhere in Washington where mischievous
lexicographers of a certain political orientation have the assigned task
of finding the words and phrases to defuse the issues that threaten the
interests of their employers. If so, campaign finance reform has done its
work well. Because what is hidden in that modest little phrase is the vision
of an honest, vigorously realized democratic republic.
* * *

To effect
a true and thoroughgoing reform would not change the innately raucous competition
of interests among us, but neither would it provide for the amplification
of some of those interests to a level that is deafening. It would amount
to a kind of revolution of our national political behavior; it would bring
people of talent and vision into political life who are not now available
to the nation; it would be breathtaking, predictive of a new authentic polyvocal
Union; and with the possibility, at last, of addressing our entrenched social
and economic inequities, the distortions of our priorities and what is grotesque
about our public institutions, we would begin to come out of the terrible
alienation that afflicts us and think again of the beauty of our national
promise. We would hope to fashion ourselves more recognizably to the ideal
of human rights implicit in our Constitution.

Perhaps, then, we should
not rely on Congress to find the votes to pass a true and thorough reform
bill that restores to us our dignity as citizens. A genuine ad hoc social
movement may be required, a state-by-state struggle by referendum, issue-specific
ratings at election time, an Internet-organized lobby to end all lobbies,
but in any event something--some great public outcry to flatten back the
ears of the distinguished colleagues in their paneled chambers.

To imagine
such glory is to invoke the idealism of Walt Whitman. Whitman did not buy
the elitist presumption of classic conservatism--that it was in the nature
of some to lead and most to follow--even as it claimed to recognize its
responsibility (as it does not now in its corporatized form) to look after,
to take care of, as one looks after or takes care of children or pets. He
saw it as a terrible depressant of human energies. He understood American
democracy's breakout potential to enlarge the dimensions of human life,
and thought that if the discourse was truly national, the communications
omni-directional, the minds of a populace living in neighborly freedom could
constellate into a universe that we hadn't yet dreamed of. That is why when
he walked the streets of nineteenth-century New York, Whitman embraced everything
he saw. He loved the multitudes, the industry of working people; he loved
the ships in the harbor, the traffic on Broadway. But he was not naïve.
He knew the newspaper business from which he made his living relied finally
for its success on the frail shoulders of itinerant boys and girls, street
urchins who lived on the few cents they made hawking the papers at every
corner. Thousands of vagrant children lived in the streets of the New York
Walt Whitman loved. Yet his exultant optimism and awe of human capacity
was not demeaned; he could carry it all, the whole society, and attend like
a nurse to its illnesses, but like a lover to its fair face.

And so must we.

its forelegs and, wrapping its rear feet around his knees, swings its tail
up between his legs and sinks its teeth into his face. And so intertwined,
monster and thief, they begin to melt into each other like hot wax, their
two heads joining, their substances merging, until a new third creature
is created, though somehow redolent of both of them. And it slowly slithers
away into the darkness.
* * *

Back in 1787, when the Constitutional Convention
had done its work and the drafted Constitution was sent out to the states
for ratification, the public's excitement was palpable. Extended and vigorous
statehouse debates echoed through the towns and villages, and as, one by
one, the states voted to ratify, church bells rang, cheers went up from
the public houses and in the major cities the people turned out to parade
with a fresh new sense of themselves as a nation.

Everyone marched--tradespeople,
workingmen, soldiers, women, clergy. They had floats in those days, too--most
often a wagon-sized ship of state, called the Union, rolling through the
streets with children waving from the scuppers. Philadelphia came up with
a float called the New Roof, a dome supported by thirteen pillars and ornamented
with stars. It was drawn by ten white horses, and at the top was a handsome
cupola surmounted by a figure of Plenty, bearing her cornucopia.

The ratification
parades were sacramental--symbolic venerations, acts of faith. From the
beginning people saw the Constitution as a kind of sacred text for a civil
society. Indeed, the voice of the Constitution is scriptural. It ordains.
It empowers itself to give law endlessly into the future. Like the Bible,
it requires interpretive commentaries that themselves have the authority
of law because its principles must be applied to a multitude of situations.
And where its prophecy has been false, as in the infamous Article IV, which
made a slave in one state a slave in all, the national calamity of a civil
war ensued before the text could be amended.

Today, the Constitution with
its Bill of Rights and further amendments rules us with a set of behavioral
prescriptions that, if we lived up to all of them, would make us a truly
free and righteous people. When the ancient Hebrews broke their covenant
they suffered a loss of identity and brought disaster upon themselves. Our
burden too is unmistakably covenantal. We may point to our 200-some years
of national survival as an open society, constitutionally sworn to a degree
of free imaginative expression that few cultures in the world can tolerate;
we may regard ourselves as an exceptional, historically self-correcting
nation whose democratic values locate us just as surely as our geography...
and yet we know at the same time that all through our history we have brutally
excluded vast numbers of us from the shelter of the New Roof, we have broken
our covenant again and again with a virtuosity verging on damnation and have
been saved only by the sacrificial efforts of Constitution-reverencing patriots
in government and out of government--Presidents, senators, Justices, abolitionists,
muckrakers, suffragists, striking workers, civil rights activists.
 What
is to be done now, when the Constitution is subjected to corporate-groomed politicians
who read it as no more than a postmodern self-deconstructing text? The present
wide-open, scandalous system of campaign financing is rationalized by a
rightist ideology that portrays the federal government as stiflingly bureaucratic,
intrusive and inimical to the natural rights of a free people. In the lifetimes
of many of us the federal government has been just the opposite, a means
of redress, redemptive justice and societal healing, as, for instance, when
it enacted the Depression measures of the thirties and the Great Society
legislation of the sixties. Today the corporate rightists in Congress mean
to privatize the Social Security system, vouch the public school system
out of existence and do whatever they can to limit if not decimate the regulatory
agencies established to control their worst business excesses. By the logic
of their thinking even the National Office of Weights and Measures could
be construed as an impediment to business practices.

It is not that members
of Congress--or indeed the media or the American public--are not aware of
the inequity of the present money-soaked system of political life in our
country. But to what extent that system is responsible for the grotesque
distortions of our present priorities--with the resultant poverty of so
many children; the way our jails proliferate for the incarceration of black
men, with more and more penal systems run privately for profit; the drift
into monopolization of our media and means of communication, with fewer
and fewer mega-corporations controlling more and more of what we read, see,
hear or understand as the news; or the cost of health insurance policies
that insure people until they get sick; the inequitable tax structure; the
international trade agreements that rescind our environmental laws; the
list is long--and how all of this is connected to the system of unrestricted
and flamboyant political donations may not be always appreciated by the
public or acknowledged consistently even by those members of Congress who
have voted to reform the laws of campaign finance.

In fact, campaign finance
reform as a phrase has been bruited about so long and to so little effect
and is so yawningly dull, dreary and unresounding, it makes one wonder if
it's not partly responsible for the conditions it has so far failed to address.
Perhaps there is a basement office somewhere in Washington where mischievous
lexicographers of a certain political orientation have the assigned task
of finding the words and phrases to defuse the issues that threaten the
interests of their employers. If so, campaign finance reform has done its
work well. Because what is hidden in that modest little phrase is the vision
of an honest, vigorously realized democratic republic.
* * *

To effect
a true and thoroughgoing reform would not change the innately raucous competition
of interests among us, but neither would it provide for the amplification
of some of those interests to a level that is deafening. It would amount
to a kind of revolution of our national political behavior; it would bring
people of talent and vision into political life who are not now available
to the nation; it would be breathtaking, predictive of a new authentic polyvocal
Union; and with the possibility, at last, of addressing our entrenched social
and economic inequities, the distortions of our priorities and what is grotesque
about our public institutions, we would begin to come out of the terrible
alienation that afflicts us and think again of the beauty of our national
promise. We would hope to fashion ourselves more recognizably to the ideal
of human rights implicit in our Constitution.

Perhaps, then, we should
not rely on Congress to find the votes to pass a true and thorough reform
bill that restores to us our dignity as citizens. A genuine ad hoc social
movement may be required, a state-by-state struggle by referendum, issue-specific
ratings at election time, an Internet-organized lobby to end all lobbies,
but in any event something--some great public outcry to flatten back the
ears of the distinguished colleagues in their paneled chambers.

To imagine
such glory is to invoke the idealism of Walt Whitman. Whitman did not buy
the elitist presumption of classic conservatism--that it was in the nature
of some to lead and most to follow--even as it claimed to recognize its
responsibility (as it does not now in its corporatized form) to look after,
to take care of, as one looks after or takes care of children or pets. He
saw it as a terrible depressant of human energies. He understood American
democracy's breakout potential to enlarge the dimensions of human life,
and thought that if the discourse was truly national, the communications
omni-directional, the minds of a populace living in neighborly freedom could
constellate into a universe that we hadn't yet dreamed of. That is why when
he walked the streets of nineteenth-century New York, Whitman embraced everything
he saw. He loved the multitudes, the industry of working people; he loved
the ships in the harbor, the traffic on Broadway. But he was not naïve.
He knew the newspaper business from which he made his living relied finally
for its success on the frail shoulders of itinerant boys and girls, street
urchins who lived on the few cents they made hawking the papers at every
corner. Thousands of vagrant children lived in the streets of the New York
Walt Whitman loved. Yet his exultant optimism and awe of human capacity
was not demeaned; he could carry it all, the whole society, and attend like
a nurse to its illnesses, but like a lover to its fair face.

And so must we.

IN THE EIGHTH CIRCLE OF THIEVES



by E. L. DOCTOROW


Click here for our special election-season website.



Eased into governance
by years and years of conservative ideology, the corporations of America
today effectively oversee the Congress, the regulatory agencies and indeed
the presidency itself. There is no Article in the Constitution that recognizes
the supracitizenship of conglomerates; nothing is written that grants enlarged
and pre-emptive voting rights to business organizations and their trade
groups. But as Washington is run today, major issues of public policy are
bent and distorted by these multiheaded Brobdingnags who bribe Congress
with their money and coddle it with their lobbies, so that time and time
again socially desirable legislation in the public interest, whether having
to do with public health or safety, environmental protection, preservation
of our natural resources or any other issue of clear relevance to the entire
society, is defeated, sabotaged or transmuted by language into its perverse
opposite.

Yes, you say, tell me about it. But this is the recurrent truth
of Washington, so rhythmically repetitive as to be its heartbeat, the way
it pumps. Corporations that pit themselves against the manifest needs of
the American people according to the issues that arise take turns as enemies
of the people. Nothing else on Capitol Hill occurs so reliably and regularly.
It so prevails as a political fact of life that it is hardly news. It has
been a long, long time since it was news. It is now only and obviously the
way things are. Banking, oil, lumber, pharmaceuticals, weaponry, communications
and electronics, chemicals, meat and poultry--whatever the industry, you'll
find it striding with a proprietary mien through the corridors of power.
But in the name of what kind of Constitution?

Apologists will cite the
First Amendment, speak of the American or God-given right of people to function
in their own interest. That is just what democracy is, they say, a raucous
contention of interests that historically proves out as the genius of our
system; it is what we have always done in this country right from the start,
when frontiersmen in coonskin caps and leggings came to town, and later
the men in cutaways and top hats, everyone, always, grabbing their representatives
by the lapels and demanding to be represented.

But conglomerated organizations
of capital are not exactly people. They are compositions of human talents
formatted to their purposes. They are dedicated networks of artificial intelligence.
They think and feel in numerical abstractions. They will advertise their
employees as their human face, they will give themselves hearts and souls
in their television commercials, but as institutions they are dimensionally
beyond the humans who work for them or the shareholders who gamble in their
stock. They transform themselves, take on or divest themselves of companies,
move across national boundaries, restructure, wax and wane, merge with others
of their ilk in an institutionalized dynamic that leaves even their executives
irrelevant. They are profit manufactories that accumulate people or rid
themselves of people according to the transhuman logic of their balance
sheets. And for the loyalty they demand and receive, the quid pro quo is
to absolve those working for them who act inhumanely on their inhuman behalf.
* * *

In effect corporate entities that function in Washington to achieve
benefits for themselves--tax loopholes, contracts, entitlements, dismantling
of regulatory acts--regardless of the overall social effect, pre-empt the
idea of the larger community, the national ideal, the United States as the
ultimate communal reality. A just nation is not envisioned but a confederacy
whose people are meant to live at the expense of one another. Such social
Darwinism finds the presumptions of democracy naïve. The corporations
that will farm our lands, insure our lives and our health, finance our homes,
entertain us, power our cars, light our lamps... ask only one thing in return:
that we recognize two forms of citizenship, common and preferred.

How contemptuous
this all is, what an enormous humiliation to a society of free people. We
may ask those who speak of this corrupt and corrupting system as a kind
of speech that mustn't be tampered with, if to privilege the free speech
of corporations with vast treasuries on those grounds is not undeniably
to squelch the speech of others who don't have the same resources. Or if,
in fact, this huge application of money to the political process that so
depreciates the power of the individual voter is not a de facto poll tax,
with the expected minorities, Afro-American, Hispanic, joined in their disfranchisement
by the white citizenry.

To consider the elected politician in all this
is to mourn the days when amateurism was part of the political culture.
Somewhere along the line political officeholding became a profession. To
keep working, politicians have regularly to come like buskers into the street,
sing their song and dance their jig and hold out their hats. In the best
of them, this ritual has to induce a degree of self-hatred. Television is
the major reason campaigning is so monstrously expensive. The airwaves are
owned by the public, but that is irrelevant to the broadcast licensees,
who charge commercial rates for programming in the public interest... and
then contribute heavily to campaigns, so that no one who is elected will
get up in Congress and say what a swindle it is for the broadcasters to
charge the public for the use of airwaves the public owns.
* * *

The fundraising
dinners are affairs of the wealthy. If you are a politician, the fatter
the check that comes in, the greater your indebtedness. Your conscience
becomes an instrument of self-deception. Some politicians are entirely at
ease with this, either because they are themselves wealthy and are one with
their contributors, or so reliably conformed to the values of the plutocracy
that they rise up fully banked--as for example the Governor of Texas, noted
for his rigorous support for the death penalty and for the civil rights
of heavily polluting industries, who miraculously appeared in all the papers
two years before the primaries as a front-runner and who now floats atop
a campaign fund of $80 million.

What kind of political culture does the
politician cheerfully acknowledge, who can say, as Republican Senator Orrin
Hatch has said, that to back reform of the system of campaign money-raising
would be an idiotic thing for his party because it collects more money than
the opposition? What degree of public alienation can a politician like Senate
majority leader Trent Lott depend on, who has brazenly said in sponsoring
legislation written by corporate lobbyists... that after all they are the
specialists in their field, who know the issues better than anyone else?
These are the remarks of senators confident of a general population so numbed
and alienated that barely 50 percent of eligible adults bother to vote in
national elections. These are the flaunted values of politicians who know
of the conglomerate-owned press culture, that there will be no editorial
muckraking from the "in depth" journalists of the broadcast media, that
the rampant corruption in Washington, the vast, deep and dangerous mutant
character of the present state of things, will not be defined for what it
is, and that who speaks of the bewildering broad front of failure and mendacity
and carelessness of human life in so much of our public policy in tones
any louder than muted regret will be marginalized for this indecorous transgression
as a leftist, a bleeding-heart liberal or perhaps a raging populist, but
in any event someone so out of the "mainstream" as not to be taken seriously.
How many in Congress today have the integrity, the strength, to distinguish
the interests of their districts or their states from the interests of their
heavy donors? How many think there is a difference? How many can honestly
admit to themselves that the big money is their constituency? To hear the
points of view of some of these people, how they have become so much the
forces that have bought them, is to realize they are no longer guilty of
hypocrisy, having been transmogrified.

The instructive image here is from
Dante's Inferno, Canto XXV. We are in a pouch of the Eighth Circle, where
the thieves are kept. A monstrous lizardlike serpent leaps onto one of the
thieves, wraps its middle feet around his belly, pins his two arms with
its forelegs and, wrapping its rear feet around his knees, swings its tail
up between his legs and sinks its teeth into his face. And so intertwined,
monster and thief, they begin to melt into each other like hot wax, their
two heads joining, their substances merging, until a new third creature
is created, though somehow redolent of both of them. And it slowly slithers
away into the darkness.
* * *

Back in 1787, when the Constitutional Convention
had done its work and the drafted Constitution was sent out to the states
for ratification, the public's excitement was palpable. Extended and vigorous
statehouse debates echoed through the towns and villages, and as, one by
one, the states voted to ratify, church bells rang, cheers went up from
the public houses and in the major cities the people turned out to parade
with a fresh new sense of themselves as a nation.

Everyone marched--tradespeople,
workingmen, soldiers, women, clergy. They had floats in those days, too--most
often a wagon-sized ship of state, called the Union, rolling through the
streets with children waving from the scuppers. Philadelphia came up with
a float called the New Roof, a dome supported by thirteen pillars and ornamented
with stars. It was drawn by ten white horses, and at the top was a handsome
cupola surmounted by a figure of Plenty, bearing her cornucopia.

The ratification
parades were sacramental--symbolic venerations, acts of faith. From the
beginning people saw the Constitution as a kind of sacred text for a civil
society. Indeed, the voice of the Constitution is scriptural. It ordains.
It empowers itself to give law endlessly into the future. Like the Bible,
it requires interpretive commentaries that themselves have the authority
of law because its principles must be applied to a multitude of situations.
And where its prophecy has been false, as in the infamous Article IV, which
made a slave in one state a slave in all, the national calamity of a civil

of heavily polluting industries, who miraculously appeared in all the papers
two years before the primaries as a front-runner and who now floats atop
a campaign fund of $80 million.

What kind of political culture does the
politician cheerfully acknowledge, who can say, as Republican Senator Orrin
Hatch has said, that to back reform of the system of campaign money-raising
would be an idiotic thing for his party because it collects more money than
the opposition? What degree of public alienation can a politician like Senate
majority leader Trent Lott depend on, who has brazenly said in sponsoring
legislation written by corporate lobbyists... that after all they are the
specialists in their field, who know the issues better than anyone else?
These are the remarks of senators confident of a general population so numbed
and alienated that barely 50 percent of eligible adults bother to vote in
national elections. These are the flaunted values of politicians who know
of the conglomerate-owned press culture, that there will be no editorial
muckraking from the "in depth" journalists of the broadcast media, that
the rampant corruption in Washington, the vast, deep and dangerous mutant
character of the present state of things, will not be defined for what it
is, and that who speaks of the bewildering broad front of failure and mendacity
and carelessness of human life in so much of our public policy in tones
any louder than muted regret will be marginalized for this indecorous transgression
as a leftist, a bleeding-heart liberal or perhaps a raging populist, but
in any event someone so out of the "mainstream" as not to be taken seriously.
How many in Congress today have the integrity, the strength, to distinguish
the interests of their districts or their states from the interests of their
heavy donors? How many think there is a difference? How many can honestly
admit to themselves that the big money is their constituency? To hear the
points of view of some of these people, how they have become so much the
forces that have bought them, is to realize they are no longer guilty of
hypocrisy, having been transmogrified.

The instructive image here is from
Dante's Inferno, Canto XXV. We are in a pouch of the Eighth Circle, where
the thieves are kept. A monstrous lizardlike serpent leaps onto one of the
thieves, wraps its middle feet around his belly, pins his two arms with
its forelegs and, wrapping its rear feet around his knees, swings its tail
up between his legs and sinks its teeth into his face. And so intertwined,
monster and thief, they begin to melt into each other like hot wax, their
two heads joining, their substances merging, until a new third creature
is created, though somehow redolent of both of them. And it slowly slithers
away into the darkness.

Back in 1787, when the Constitutional Convention
had done its work and the drafted Constitution was sent out to the states
for ratification, the public's excitement was palpable. Extended and vigorous
statehouse debates echoed through the towns and villages, and as, one by
one, the states voted to ratify, church bells rang, cheers went up from
the public houses and in the major cities the people turned out to parade
with a fresh new sense of themselves as a nation.

Everyone marched--tradespeople,
workingmen, soldiers, women, clergy. They had floats in those days, too--most
often a wagon-sized ship of state, called the Union, rolling through the
streets with children waving from the scuppers. Philadelphia came up with
a float called the New Roof, a dome supported by thirteen pillars and ornamented
with stars. It was drawn by ten white horses, and at the top was a handsome
cupola surmounted by a figure of Plenty, bearing her cornucopia.

The ratification
parades were sacramental--symbolic venerations, acts of faith. From the
beginning people saw the Constitution as a kind of sacred text for a civil
society. Indeed, the voice of the Constitution is scriptural. It ordains.
It empowers itself to give law endlessly into the future. Like the Bible,
it requires interpretive commentaries that themselves have the authority
of law because its principles must be applied to a multitude of situations.
And where its prophecy has been false, as in the infamous Article IV, which
made a slave in one state a slave in all, the national calamity of a civil
war ensued before the text could be amended.

Today, the Constitution with
its Bill of Rights and further amendments rules us with a set of behavioral
prescriptions that, if we lived up to all of them, would make us a truly
free and righteous people. When the ancient Hebrews broke their covenant
they suffered a loss of identity and brought disaster upon themselves. Our
burden too is unmistakably covenantal. We may point to our 200-some years
of national survival as an open society, constitutionally sworn to a degree
of free imaginative expression that few cultures in the world can tolerate;
we may regard ourselves as an exceptional, historically self-correcting
nation whose democratic values locate us just as surely as our geography...
and yet we know at the same time that all through our history we have brutally
excluded vast numbers of us from the shelter of the New Roof, we have broken
our covenant again and again with a virtuosity verging on damnation and have
been saved only by the sacrificial efforts of Constitution-reverencing patriots
in government and out of government--Presidents, senators, Justices, abolitionists,
muckrakers, suffragists, striking workers, civil rights activists.
 What
is to be done now, when the Constitution is subjected to corporate-groomed politicians
who read it as no more than a postmodern self-deconstructing text? The present
wide-open, scandalous system of campaign financing is rationalized by a
rightist ideology that portrays the federal government as stiflingly bureaucratic,
intrusive and inimical to the natural rights of a free people. In the lifetimes
of many of us the federal government has been just the opposite, a means
of redress, redemptive justice and societal healing, as, for instance, when
it enacted the Depression measures of the thirties and the Great Society
legislation of the sixties. Today the corporate rightists in Congress mean
to privatize the Social Security system, vouch the public school system
out of existence and do whatever they can to limit if not decimate the regulatory
agencies established to control their worst business excesses. By the logic
of their thinking even the National Office of Weights and Measures could
be construed as an impediment to business practices.

It is not that members
of Congress--or indeed the media or the American public--are not aware of
the inequity of the present money-soaked system of political life in our
country. But to what extent that system is responsible for the grotesque
distortions of our present priorities--with the resultant poverty of so
many children; the way our jails proliferate for the incarceration of black
men, with more and more penal systems run privately for profit; the drift
into monopolization of our media and means of communication, with fewer
and fewer mega-corporations controlling more and more of what we read, see,
hear or understand as the news; or the cost of health insurance policies
that insure people until they get sick; the inequitable tax structure; the
international trade agreements that rescind our environmental laws; the
list is long--and how all of this is connected to the system of unrestricted
and flamboyant political donations may not be always appreciated by the
public or acknowledged consistently even by those members of Congress who
have voted to reform the laws of campaign finance.

In fact, campaign finance
reform as a phrase has been bruited about so long and to so little effect
and is so yawningly dull, dreary and unresounding, it makes one wonder if
it's not partly responsible for the conditions it has so far failed to address.
Perhaps there is a basement office somewhere in Washington where mischievous
lexicographers of a certain political orientation have the assigned task
of finding the words and phrases to defuse the issues that threaten the
interests of their employers. If so, campaign finance reform has done its
work well. Because what is hidden in that modest little phrase is the vision
of an honest, vigorously realized democratic republic.
* * *

To effect
a true and thoroughgoing reform would not change the innately raucous competition
of interests among us, but neither would it provide for the amplification
of some of those interests to a level that is deafening. It would amount
to a kind of revolution of our national political behavior; it would bring
people of talent and vision into political life who are not now available
to the nation; it would be breathtaking, predictive of a new authentic polyvocal
Union; and with the possibility, at last, of addressing our entrenched social
and economic inequities, the distortions of our priorities and what is grotesque
about our public institutions, we would begin to come out of the terrible
alienation that afflicts us and think again of the beauty of our national
promise. We would hope to fashion ourselves more recognizably to the ideal
of human rights implicit in our Constitution.

Perhaps, then, we should
not rely on Congress to find the votes to pass a true and thorough reform
bill that restores to us our dignity as citizens. A genuine ad hoc social
movement may be required, a state-by-state struggle by referendum, issue-specific
ratings at election time, an Internet-organized lobby to end all lobbies,
but in any event something--some great public outcry to flatten back the
ears of the distinguished colleagues in their paneled chambers.

To imagine
such glory is to invoke the idealism of Walt Whitman. Whitman did not buy
the elitist presumption of classic conservatism--that it was in the nature
of some to lead and most to follow--even as it claimed to recognize its
responsibility (as it does not now in its corporatized form) to look after,
to take care of, as one looks after or takes care of children or pets. He
saw it as a terrible depressant of human energies. He understood American
democracy's breakout potential to enlarge the dimensions of human life,
and thought that if the discourse was truly national, the communications
omni-directional, the minds of a populace living in neighborly freedom could
constellate into a universe that we hadn't yet dreamed of. That is why when
he walked the streets of nineteenth-century New York, Whitman embraced everything
he saw. He loved the multitudes, the industry of working people; he loved
the ships in the harbor, the traffic on Broadway. But he was not naïve.
He knew the newspaper business from which he made his living relied finally
for its success on the frail shoulders of itinerant boys and girls, street
urchins who lived on the few cents they made hawking the papers at every
corner. Thousands of vagrant children lived in the streets of the New York
Walt Whitman loved. Yet his exultant optimism and awe of human capacity
was not demeaned; he could carry it all, the whole society, and attend like
a nurse to its illnesses, but like a lover to its fair face.

And so must we.

Dear Mr. Chimera:

 In reference to you commenting that others besides the candidates
make comments, remember to include yourself.

 Also, I never knew your family name was "Chimeranga@...".
Could you please tell us how you ever managed to spell that as
a small school child? I ask because it seems that your spelling
skills have deteriorated since then.  

 I look forward to your unsubstantiated rhetoric and argumentativeness
once again. Consider a career in comedy; you have a future there!!!

           Midnight closings at issue: City liquor-license revisions
tabled 

           Published in the Home News Tribune 8/01/00 

           By FRANCES CARROLL
           STAFF WRITER

           The City Council yesterday tabled an ordinance that
would have put out of business every establishment
           that serves alcohol in and around a residential zone
and forced all other liquor-license holders to close up
           shop at midnight.

           The ordinance, introduced quietly two weeks ago, was
drafted under the guise of a measure to cut down
           on the noise at businesses that offer live music and
dancing, but if adopted it could have forced the closure
           of restaurants like the renowned Frog & Peach.

           All other bars and restaurants that hold liquor licenses
would have had
           to close at midnight, regardless of where they were
located or if they
           featured music.

           The proposed ordinance would have created a new license
and rules for
           "cabarets," and in the first section makes reference
to businesses that sell
           alcohol and offer live music and dancing.

           However, in the second section the scope of the ordinance
becomes
           much broader.

           While Webster's New World Dictionary defines cabaret
as "a
           restaurant or cafe with dancing, singing, skits, etc.
as entertainment," the
           New Brunswick council defined the word cabaret for
the purposes of
           the ordinance as "a premises licensed for on premises
retail sale of
           alcohol beverages."

           That would include nearly every business in New Brunswick
that holds a liquor license, which number
           about 80, officials said. Only those operating with
a plenary retail consumption license would be required to
           apply for the new cabaret license, at $350 for the
first year and $200 for each year thereafter.

           Shortly after the council tabled the ordinance for
two weeks for "more discussion," City Attorney William
           Hamilton indicated the broad definition of cabaret
may have been an oversight and said he should be
           blamed because he drafted the document.

           But Council President Joseph Schrum said he knew exactly
what he was voting for when he voted to
           introduce the ordinance and that was no liquor licenses
in primarily residential neighborhoods and all
           businesses that serve alcohol to close at midnight,
two hours earlier than the current mandated 2 a.m.
           closing time.

           "We sure woke everybody up, didn't we," said Schrum,
who declined to comment further on that
           statement.

           Both he and Councilman Robert Recine said the ordinance
will not be adopted in its current form, and the
           council may opt to drop the issue all together in
the end. They said they ideally want to come up with a
           compromise that will answer residents who repeatedly
complain about noise, crowds and disturbances in
           and around taverns that feature live music but which
won't put tavern owners out of business.

           "We're trying to keep the quality of life in town,"
said Schrum. "They're trying to make money, which I
           respect, but we have people in these neighborhoods
who want to sleep at night."

           The ordinance as introduced said no cabaret could
operate in a residential zone or if 60 percent or more of
           properties within 250 feet of the premises are zoned
residential. It also said no business could be operated
           as a cabaret later than midnight, except for New Year's
Eve.

           Local bar and tavern owners found out about the proposed
ordinance slowly through word-of-mouth last
           week, and many yesterday were under the impression
it was solely a ban on live music after midnight. That
           ban alone could signal the end of New Brunswick's
growing reputation as a destination for up and coming
           musical talent not to mention kill the after-theater
business, they said.

           Club owners said their business was hurt when the
city rolled back weekend closing from 3 a.m. to 2 a.m.
           in 1995.

           Many tavern owners say they would lose so much business
by not offering music after midnight they could
           be forced to close.

           Many patrons don't show up until 11 p.m. or after,
and if there's no music customers are not "just going
           to sit down after midnight drinking and staring at
each other," said Steve Flaks, owner of the Melody Bar on
           French Street which features music seven nights a
week.

           If the ordinance is adopted as is, it would be a death
sentence for the Court Tavern, agreed Bobby Albert,
           owner of the Church Street club which has featured
live music for nearly 20 years in what is considered a
           commercial area.

           Albert said his tavern, which over the years has featured
bands which have gone on to national stardom
           such as the Smithereens and the Spin Doctors, has
never had a complaint about noise in 20 years.

           Stan Weinberg, owner of the Plum St. Pub on Hamilton
Street said "There's a lot of talent out there and
           by playing these bars it opened up a lot of doors
for them. Now they want to shut it down."

           Hamilton said it was noise complaints from residents
who live near the Plum St. Pub and D'Gala Cafe on
           Commercial Avenue that prompted the proposed ordinance.
Both of those bars had conditions placed on
           their liquor licenses in June limiting live music
to 11 p.m. or midnight and requiring an off-duty police officer
           to be on site on weekends, he said.

           Kermit Wade, manager of the Harvest Moon restaurant
and nightclub on George Street, said that
           restaurants in the city also would be adversely affected
by the restrictions.

           "Live music is a good way to unwind (after a meal),"
Wade said. "We have bands almost every night."

           The city would also suffer as it will become less
appealing as a destination for business travelers, Wade
           said.

           "The Hyatt (on Albany Street) has conferences and
(attendees) like to go out," Wade said. "What will
           there be to do at night?"

           The council placed a midnight cut-off on live jazz
and R&B music at Delta's Bar & Grill on Dennis Street
           when it opened seven months ago in the middle of the
RiverWatch development, said owner Josh Suggs.
           The restriction was placed on Delta's liquor license,
but Suggs hoped to have it lifted in the near future. 

           Staff writer Chris Jordan contributed to this report.

Subject:chimeranga == liberation struggle in Africa
Message:

FYI.

Hit your favorite search engine and search for chimeranga.
It (apparently) roughly translates to liberation struggle.

Also, 'Taji' was a factory in Iraq that was bombed.

What fun . . .

To all interested parties:

The Media Committee meets Wednesday nights at 8pm, at Jim's house.  
Today is, of course, Wednesday!

It is strongly desired that people interested in becoming involved in 
the many activities of the committee -- article composition, layout 
and design, flyers, and to some extent working with the Press -- stop 
by.  

We are ESPECIALLY in need of someone to help out with layout for the 
newspaper, especially later on this month.  We have one person 
overburdened with this particular task.

Message:

this is the third email i've received regarding the bar closing. i think it 
would be appropriate, and a damn good idea, if someone composed a letter in 
response, and forwarded it out to these same people.

this is a perfect opportunity to bash the current council ( i have to say 
it: they are the biggest fools i've seen in trying to pass something like 
this right before an election!!!!) and PROMOTE the People's Campaign.

perhaps a candidate should draft up a letter? i think we should follow up on 
this soon, so as to not lose the momentum of all these events...

Dear friends, 

Women put up with a lot of crap, but
this year's Presidential farce has to
take the cake. 

We now have four men on the "two"
major party tickets running for the
White House. Neither candidate,
Democrat nor Republican, even
bothered to CONSIDER a woman for
Vice President, let alone appoint one.

Women: 53% of the population -- the
MAJORITY gender -- and once again,
there is ZERO representation. The
minority still rules, still calls the
shots, still holds the reins of power.
That's called "apartheid."

You know what amazes me? That
neither Gore nor Bush even tried to
PRETEND they were considering a
woman for Vice President! In the past,
the all-male Presidential candidates
have at least "floated" some names, or
said "so-and-so" was on "the short
list." They thought women might be
upset if it looked like they were being
ignored. So they played the game of
interviewing "Pat Schroeder" for the
job, or mentioning "Elizabeth Dole" as
a "possibility." 

No more. 

This year, in what appears to be a
political version of "battered women's
syndrome," guy politicians have
discovered that they don't have to do a
damn thing to placate women voters.
They are convinced women will just
take it -- in silence.

And just as Dick Cheney is the true
face of George W. Bush, Joe Lieberman
is the true face of Al Gore.
Lieberman's number one financial
backer in Connecticut is the insurance
industry -- and when they say "jump,"
he leaps. He even opposed Clinton's
watered-down health insurance bill. He
is an enemy of affirmative action. He
has voted for tax cuts for the rich,
voted for NAFTA, supports a form of
prayer ("the minute of silence") in the
public schools (and the granting of
vouchers to help fund religious
schools), and joined Al Gore as one of
only 10 Democrats in the Senate who
supported Bush the First in starting
the Gulf War. 

In short, a real guy's guy.

Of course, not to beat a dead Corvair,
there is a candidate who is now,
according to Tim Russert on "Meet the
Press" last Sunday, polling between
11% and 15% in some surveys, and
has chosen a woman as his running
mate. His name is Ralph Nader and HER
name is Winona LaDuke. She is a
Harvard graduate from Minnesota and
a Native American. She has a bunch of
wild ideas women usually come up
with, the kinds of things that probably
keep them off the other tickets -- like,
everybody should be guaranteed
insurance if they get sick, or working
moms and kids deserve day care, or
maybe we shoud build a few less
submarines in Connecticut and build a
few new schools in the Bronx. Stuff
like that. Chick stuff, ya know. Stuff
us guys ain't got time for.

Ralph and Winona have tripled their
standing in the polls since they
started. There is a momentum taking
place and maybe, just maybe, the
majority - women - will rise up and
say enough of this male apartheid.

Yours,

           New Brunswick Tomorrow president resigns 

           Published in the Home News Tribune 8/11/00 

           By SHARON WATERS
           STAFF WRITER

           The president of New Brunswick Tomorrow, Stephen H.
O'Connor, has resigned effective Nov. 1 to
           pursue completion of a doctorate degree.

           The board of directors will meet next week to discuss
a replacement, O'Connor said. The organization
           hopes to fill the position before O'Connor leaves,
said NBT Chairman Chris Kjeldsen.

           O'Connor said his decision was based solely on the
need to complete his thesis and final requirements for a
           doctorate degree in urban planning and policy development
from the Edward J. Bloustein School at Rutgers
           University.

           It was a difficult decision because his nearly five
years at NBT were very gratifying, O'Connor said.

           "A large part of me is here and it's sometimes hard
to walk away," he said.

           The time requirements of managing a small nonprofit
extend to all hours of the day and night and also
           through the weekend and did not allow him to devote
enough time to his thesis and family, O'Connor said.

           He hopes to graduate next June when his son Ryan,
17, will graduate from high school. O'Connor also has
           a daughter, Katie, 15.

           NBT's board of directors appointed O'Connor as president
in December 1995. He previously worked as
           executive director of the New Jersey Housing Assistance
Corp.

           O'Connor's proudest accomplishments at NBT are expanding
the scope of programs and increasing the
           annual operating budget about 2 1/2 times during his
tenure, he said. The private nonprofit agency that
           addresses social-service issues in the city has about
3 million of programs now versus about $1 million five
           years ago, he said.

           NBT also oversees the social-services component of
the federal HOPE VI project that involves
           demolishing the public New Brunswick Homes high-rises
and replacing them with new mixed-income
           housing, as well as relocating residents and helping
them attain self-sufficiency.

           The resignation will have no effect on NBT's role
in the HOPE VI project, O'Connor said.

           "Everything is in the implementation stage and all
the key players are in place," he said.

           NBT created the program's design and oversees it,
but Catholic Charities actually provides services to the
           residents, O'Connor said. The people working in the
field are still in place, he added. 

           NBT provides oversight and advisory roles for the
HOPE VI project, said O'Connor. He also noted that
           NBT's vice president, Jeffrey M. Vega, manages almost
all the programmatic aspects of NBT.

Message:


Housing agency has a good record

           As executive director of the New Brunswick Housing
Authority, I take great offense from your July 25
editorial, which made the unsubstantiated statement the authority
is not "the most trusted public agency in the city." This unprovoked
statement cannot go unanswered. 

           Here are just a few examples of the trust that has
been placed in us by our residents, the city and the federal
government.

           On Sept. 16 and 17, as Tropical Storm Floyd caused
the Raritan River to swell over its banks and began
taking over the land on which the New Brunswick Homes sit, our
residents trusted us as we provided them with food, transportation
and lodging; protected their belongings; and returned them to
their homes in a timely fashion. No major injuries occurred.

           City officials have trusted us to act as New Brunswick's
redevelopment authority. We have assisted in the
financing of over $400 million of revitalization over much of
the last 25 years.

           Through the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the New Brunswick Housing Authority has been given
the opportunity to change the face of public housing in New Brunswick.
By entrusting us with a $7.4 million grant, HUD has shown they
believe we can not only provide more suitable public housing,
but more importantly integrate those on the lowest rungs of the
income ladder back into the community. This HOPE VI grant has
allowed us to leverage an additional $35 million that will be
used to
not only re-house our residents but also provide them with the
necessary social services to survive in the private housing market.

           Kevin Quince
           EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
           NEW BRUNSWICK HOUSING AND REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY

Mr. Quince conveniently forgets that while the city was busy bailing out the 
well-to-do residents of the new-fandangled "Renaissance" condos, not to 
mention the police station, the NB Homes residents had to fend for 
themselves as the flood waters rose around their homes.  Also, it was on 
account of the extraordinary efforts of NJFO & Co. that forced the city to 
relocate the NB Homes residents into motels rather than sucking it up on the 
flea-bitten mattresses on the cramped & damp Lord Stirling gym floor. -MS

National Guard Is Prepared to Deploy 3,000 Troops in
L.A.
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer
http://www.latimes.com
The California National Guard is prepared to deploy as
many as 3,000 soldiers to help quell any civil disorder during the 
Democratic
National
Convention. In addition to supporting law enforcement, the troops will 
assist
firefighters in a plan that includes the use of the Los Alamitos-based 
Weapons
of Mass
Destruction team to combat acts of chemical, biological or nuclear 
terrorism.
Maj.
Gen. Paul D. Monroe Jr., the Guard's
adjutant general in Sacramento, said the preparations
are precautionary.
Soldiers and equipment can be deployed within 24 hours
after they are requested by local officials, he said. "The Los
Angeles Police Department is running the security program for the DNC. We 
were
not
included in the [local] planning," Monroe said. "It's felt that they have 
enough
law
enforcement personnel available to them to handle any problem. But we would
be negligent if we didn't plan for any eventuality."
In preparing for the Democratic convention, the LAPD will be supported by 
the
Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, California Highway Patrol and officers 
from
various
police departments in nearby counties. The security
teams will include federal agents assigned to protect Vice President Al Gore 
and
other
officials. State authorities are still smarting from the 1992 Los Angeles 
riots,
which
caught the Guard unprepared. Political indecision and lack of
coordination in Sacramento led to delays in mobilizing
the Guard, and some soldiers were sent to riot areas without ammunition.
This time, Guard officials began preparations in January. The plan took 
effect
last
Friday and will remain in place through Aug. 18. "For the past two years, 
there
have
been concerns from the electric utilities regarding a severe drain on
the power system in the summer months. Brownouts are a
very real possibility, as is a heat emergency in the Los Angeles
area," said the 31-page operational plan. The warning about possible power
shortages
is especially timely after the hot weather that has led to high electrical 
usage
and
taxed the state's power grid. "Nobody can predict what's going to
happen," Monroe said. "But we prepare for the eventuality in case we're 
called."
But
preparedness does not mean that soldiers
will be quartered in local armories during the convention. "We have not been
asked to
stage forces or to be prepared that way," Monroe said.
Instead, the Guard's plan
said that "on 24 hours notice [the Guard] .. will
deploy up to three 1,000-person response teams to the Los Angeles area in
support of
civilian authority." The troops probably will assemble at Camp San Luis 
Obispo
and the
Armed Forces Reserve Center in Los Alamitos and then convoy to Los
Angeles. In 1992, a large number of soldiers were sent
to the Los Angeles riots without locking plates in their M-16 assault 
rifles,
preventing the weapons from being fired fully automatic. This time 
commanders
were
ordered to have locking plates "installed and functional" by July 31.

Message:

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Revitalization, not Gentrification!

Dear Editor:

(Regarding the Aug. 6, Star Leger expose on Newark development trends)

At a recent commemoration of the 1967 Newark Rebellion sponsored by the 
People�s Organization for Progress (P.O.P.), community artist and poet Halim 
Sulliman lamented that the current administration is turning �Brick City 
into Stick Town.�

This potent  metaphor describes the treacherous path of development being 
forced on the city by the likes of Newark�s deputy mayor, Al Faiella.  In 
his self-styled �reactive� manner, Faiella called community activist Nancy 
Zak �shortsighted� for criticizing the James administration�s policy of 
catering to profit-driven developers whose shoddy construction projects 
undermine the fabric of city neighborhoods.

Dean Urs Gauchat of the NJ School of Architecture correctly pointed out that 
these developers must rely on the Zoning Board�s support.  Only such a 
rubber stamp committee of political appointees would allow the destruction 
of sound historic brick buildings while constructing flimsy stick houses on 
poisoned soil, and variances encouraging developers to maximize their 
wallets while minimizing the integrity of their work.

But neither should we embrace City Councilperson Amadour�s desire to follow 
Hoboken�s lead in saving the historic buildings while yuppifying the poor, 
working-class communities with chic middle-class zombies who don�t know 
where they are.  The James Administration�s �dance with the devil�opers 
means that residents continue to get burned as the debate on how best to 
gentrify (ethnically cleanse) Newark rages on.  Indeed, asking the market 
frenzied land-snatchers and wealthy business elite to determine the future 
of Newark is like asking the fox to look after the chicken coup.

This city needs a democratically determined central plan for revitalization 
that preserves the integrity of Newark�s historic neighborhoods, focuses on 
the needs of its working-class residents, and concretely supports it�s local 
artists through grants and specific zoning for an indigenous arts district.

Matthew Smith, Newark

PUBLIC EDUCATION IMPROVEMENTS STALLED IN CONGRESS

    Since 1965, the Elementary Secondary Education Act (ESEA) has governed 
federal education programs for kindergarten through 12th grade. Congress is 
required to review ESEA every five years and make  changes to address issues 
facing students in our public schools. For the first time in 35 years, it is 
unlikely that Congress will complete ESEA.

At issue is whether federal dollars, which account for approximately 7% of 
funding for public education, should be targeted to improve student 
achievement and teacher quality.

Congress� failure to adequately address the following issues is stalling 
passage of ESEA:

* Repairing and modernizing schools. More than 14 million children in the 
United States attend schools that need extensive repairs. Students learn 
better in safe, modern schools with the latest technology, not in 
dilapidated, overcrowded classrooms.

* Reducing class size. Research shows that class size reduction in grades 
1-3, combined with a qualified teacher, leads to higher student achievement 
in reading and math. In the current school-year, approximately 1.7 million 
children are expected to benefit directly by being educated in smaller 
classes.

* Strengthening accountability. To ensure that in local school disctricts 
federal funds are targeted to raising academic standards, improving teacher 
quality, and improving student achievement, school  districts must be held 
accountable for student performance.

HERE�S WHAT YOU CAN DO!

* Help spread the word; work with friends and family to distribute this 
alert in your community.

* Call your members of Congress at 202/224-3121 and urge them to continue to 
target federal education funding to improving student achievement and 
raising academic standards.

Subject:HNT: Board of Ed , Censure of Martin Arocho
Message:


As seen in today's Home News:

NEW BRUNSWICK: City's board of ed censures president 


Published in the Home News Tribune 8/16/00 
By SHARON WATERS
STAFF WRITER

City board of education President Martin Arocho was censured
at last night's board meeting for violating the School Ethics
Act with a 1998 vote in favor of awarding a $415,000 contract
to his employer, the Puerto Rican Action Board. 

The state School Ethics Commission, which operates under the
state Department of Education, determined Arocho had violated
a state statute and ordered the board of education to post and
read in public the resolution of censure.

"To me, they imposed the least of the penalties. I don't think
I did anything wrong by voting for the contract," said Arocho,
noting the contract had been voted for in the past by the board.
"I didn't think it was affecting me or PRAB." 

Possible sanctions are a reprimand, censure, suspension from
the school board or removal from the school board.

Arocho had asked the commission for a reprimand, which would
have been privately issued, but the commission reaffirmed a public
censure was appropriate.

"It's a reasonably appropriate penalty, but I think Arocho should
have been suspended. His action was contrary to well-established
law but suspensions are rare so I have go along with the decision,"
said New Brunswick activist Brian Villa.

Last year Villa filed a complaint against Arocho and board member
Edwin Gutierrez for voting on a July 1998 resolution awarding
a $415,583 contract to the nonprofit PRAB to provide preschool
for city 4-year-olds.

Villa says the two board members should have abstained from the
vote because they were both listed as members of PRAB in a board
flier and because Arocho worked for PRAB. He also challenged
Gutierrez's appointment to the board by Mayor Jim Cahill because
he is a city employee working in the Community Development Division.

The commission found that Arocho was not a member of PRAB at
the time of the vote, but he was an employee of the organization,
and therefore was in violation of a statute that prohibits school
officials from acting on any matter in which they or an immediate
family member has a direct financial involvement.

The commission dismissed the complaints against Gutierrez, finding
that Gutierrez's employment with the city did not constitute
a substantial conflict, and that Gutierrez was not a member of
PRAB at the time of the vote in 1998. Gutierrez was a founding
member of PRAB in 1971 and served on the group's board of trustees
until 1991.

Villa has appealed the commission's finding on Gutierrez.

Cuba: The Illusive Island

September 9 to October 14

The Works of Afro-Cuban Realist Painter Raul Villarreal

Reception -Saturday September 9, 2000   4pm to 8pm

Raul Villarreal's realism is steeped in the symbology of Santeria,
romantic Cuban/Spanish mythology and nationalism.  Like many Cubans,
Villarreal yearns for his Cuban home, his culture, his people, his religion,
experienced as a child and a young man  in Cuba.  To Villarreal, the island 
is like an illusive woman, one he can see but cannot reach.  Using his 
traditional colors and those of the nature of the island, Villarreal, 
dresses his women in the colors of Orishas and surrounds them by the hungry 
Cuban landscape. He makes no bones about expressing the connectedness of 
Cuban life to its African religious roots.  At the same time Villarreal 
involves himself in a personal romance with the figure, his brush becoming 
the hand or fingers that smooth the flesh of his island women, as if to 
soothe them in their hunger to find again, the homeland.  A hunger, that has 
some silent lust, some longing, some pain and always behind it all the 
constant yearning desire.

A New Jersey painter, Raul Villarreal is a graduate of New Jersey City 
University, under the tutelage of Professor of Art and Artist of renown Ben 
Jones.  Villarreal is from the city of San Francisco De Paula, the town in 
which Hemingway lived.  His father was considered to be Hemingway's Cuban 
son and Villarreal grew up with the legend of Hemingway and the great 
artists that were part of La Finka as part of his youth's education.

He is the outgrowth of a tradition of Cuban realism, that other family 
members have practiced in generations past, and whose works still hang in 
the home of Earnest Hemingway.

Gallery Hours: During exhibits- Wednesdays 1pm to 6pm; Saturdays and
Sundays 11am to 6pm.  Other times by appointment.

NEW BRUNSWICK PEOPLES� CAMPAIGN
149 REDMOND STREET
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ 08901
732/545-5756
												


							August 19, 2000

Elaine Flynn
Middlesex County Clerk
1 JFK Square
New Brunswick, NJ 08901

		Re: 	New Brunswick Municipal Question
			November 2000 General Election

Dear Ms. Flynn:

	On behalf of the New Brunswick Peoples� Campaign, I
am writing to provide a suggestion as to the
appropriate language to appear on the November 2000
ballot in respect of the municipal question to be
voted on by the voters of New Brunswick regarding the
change of the board of education from an elected to an
appointed board.  We believe that pursuant to N.J.S.A.
19:14-1 et seq., you are the official responsible for
preparing the phrasing of this question.  In the event
you are not, we are also sending copies of this
letters to other officials who may be responsible for
this task, and by copy of this letter to them, we ask
them to adhere to the same suggestions.

	As you know, both statutory and case law impose a
number of requirements with respect to public
questions to voted upon by the electorate.  This case
law is fully applicable to public questions involving
boards of education.  N.J.S.A. 19:60-1(b); N.J.S.A.
19:3-6.

	In particular, this body of law emphasizes that
questions must be clearly written, easily understood
by all voters, and address the heart of the matter to
be voted upon, without technical or otherwise
confusing language.  In addition, certain questions
(including this one) must include an interpretive
statement which must likewise meet certain criteria of
clarity, informativeness, and fairness.  Thus, as to
the question itself, N.J.S.A. 19:3-6 provides:

Any public question voted upon at an election shall be
presented in simple language that can be easily
understood by the voter.  The printed phrasing of said
question on the ballots shall clearly set forth the
true purpose of the matter being voted upon.  
(emphasis added); see also Board of Ed. of Hackensack
v. City of Hackensack, 63 N.J. Super. 560 (App. Div.
1960).

In addition, the interpretive statement must be
drafted following similar principles.    Last year, in
Morris Bd. of Freeholders v. State, 159 N.J. 565, 582
(1999), the Supreme Court reaffirmed earlier precedent
mandating clarity of interpretive statements:

Questions put to the voters must be accompanied by an
interpretive statement that serves as an aid to
understanding the matter under consideration.  See
N.J.S.A. 19:3-6 (mandating "brief statement
interpreting the ... [question] and setting forth the
true purpose of the matter being voted upon");  see
also Gormley v. Lan, 88 N.J. 26, 37 (1981) (stating
interpretative statement is designed to "help the
voter understand more about the amendment than the
public question tells him, for the purpose of aiding
him in his decision").  The interpretative statement
should "get to the heart of the matter as understood
by those who are knowledgeable about it."  Gormley,
supra, 88 N.J. at 37.   Put another way, the
interpretive statement should always be informative
and fair.  Id. at 37-38;  Kimmelman v. Burgio, 204
N.J. Super. 44, 53 (App. Div. 1985).
(emphasis added).  In sum, the question and statement
must be informative, fair, and easily understood. 
This text on the ballot must be drafted in a manner to
state �clearly� what is being voted upon; to get to
the heart of it; and to aid in informing the voter of
his or her decision.

	The Peoples� Campaign believes that the language
actually chosen when this same question was placed on
the ballot in previous years (and which, presumably,
might provide a guide to choosing the text of the
question this year), does not comport with the
applicable legal requirements.  More particularly, the
1998 ballot question asked voters to decided whether
New Brunswick �which is governed by the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 18A:9-2 - Type I school districts, be
governed by the provisions of N.J.S.A. 18A:9-3 - Type
II school districts?�  This question sheds absolutely
no light on what is being asked of voters unless the
voter engaged in extensive statutory research on the
meaning and implications of each of those statutes. 
Thus, the question, by failing to disclose that its
objective is a change from an elected to an appointed
board, on its face, clearly violates the requirements
of N.J.S.A. 19:3-6, mandating that a question be posed
in �simple language that can be easily understood by
the voter� and �set[ting] forth the true purpose of
the matter being voted upon.�  A decision to use that
same text in the upcoming election would be a clear
violation of law.

	The interpretive statement chosen in 1998 is equally
out of compliance with the law.  Although the 1998
interpretive statement disclosed the general nature of
the change being presented to voters, it was done in a
confusing manner, including a superfluous statement
about appeals of budget decisions to the Commissioner
of Education, which would occur under both an elected
and an appointed board of education.  Morris Board of
Freeholders, supra, mandates that the statement must
�help the voter understand� the question for the
express purpose of �aiding him in his decision� and
must �get to the heart of the matter� without
superfluous or confusing language that fails to
identify both the current system and the effect of
approval of the question.  The interpretive statement
in 1998, contrary to Morris Board of Freeholders, was
neither �informative� nor �fair� and its use in the
upcoming election would also be a clear violation of
that mandate.  

	In that regard, we suggest the following question and
interpretive statement be placed on the ballot to
ensure compliance with the above-quoted statutes and
decisional law:

MUNICIPAL QUESTION

	Shall the school district of the City of New
Brunswick, which is now governed by the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 18A:9-2 (mayorally-appointed board of
education with budget ratified by Board of School
Estimate) be governed instead by the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 18A:9-3 (elected board of education with
budget ratified by voters)?

INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT
Approval of the question would result in New
Brunswick�s board of education being elected by the
voters of the school district, and the budget being
ratified by the voters of the school district. 
Currently, board members are appointed by the mayor
and the budget is ratified by the Board of School
Estimate.

	If you have further questions about this, please do
not hesitate to contact me.  I look forward to hearing
a response from you shortly so that any differences of
opinion about the text of the question may be resolved
in time for the printing of the ballot.


Respectfully submitted,

Subscribers:

Frank is correct in his comments that the posting of George W.
is divisive. Louise is also correct --in my personal assessment--
 of what George W. practical policies represent for the future
of the nation. 

Perhaps subject matters --which I believe are off-topic-- are
better left being posted through other procedures.

This would help to keep the "united front" united. Right?

Subject:re Star-Ledger School Ethics Complaint w/ Corrective Notes
Message:


A NOTE ON THE ARTICLE: The paper's article has some inconsistencies
and is incorrect in at least one place.  Clairifications and
corrective comments follow.

First, "the ethical line" is the law. 

Second, the (local school) board did not reprimand Arocho, but
was ordered to read the resolution at its next scheduled meeting.


Third, the censure is not the "lightest form of punishment";
that would be a reprimand. A censure is a significant punishment
--that's why the Resolution of Censure was read, and that's why
the Resolution of Censure has to be posted in public places for
thirty (30 ) days. 

Fourth, the complaint filed against Arocho (C16-99), did not
include Gutierrez (C16-99). 

Fifth, a "reprimand" is a lower form of punishment than a censure.
 The text of the School Ethics Commission decision can be found
on the State of New Jersey homepage under its own link, by visiting
the state department of education website.

I'm sorry there has been confusion in this matter. I anticipate
a future remedy. The Star-Ledger article follows below.

School board censures president 

08/17/00

By Sue Epstein
STAFF WRITER


The New Brunswick Board of Education has publicly censured its
president for crossing an ethical line. 


The board reprimanded Martin Arocho for failing to abstain from
a 1998 board vote to award a $415,583 contract for preschool
services to the nonprofit Puerto Rican Action Board, for which
Arocho works. 


The state School Ethics Commission ordered Arocho's censure --
the lightest form of punishment he could receive -- and state
Education Commissioner David Hespe upheld the panel's decision.



Arocho could not be reached for comment yesterday. 


Brian Villa, the activist who filed the complaint against Arocho
with the ethics commission, yesterday called the board's action
his vindication. 


''It was gratifying to be found to have been ethically correct.
I was personally attacked for filing the complaint and it was
called frivolous. The state commissioner of education didn't
agree," said Villa. 


The complaint Villa filed also named Edwin Gutierrez, another
board member, who voted for the project, but the commission dismissed
Villa's complaint against him, saying there was no indication
Gutierrez was linked to the Puerto Rican Action Board. 


Gutierrez, who helped found the Puerto Rican Action Board in
1971, gave up his seat on its board of trustees in 1991. The
commission acknowledged that close connections can outlast direct
affiliation but said it "cannot conclude in the present case
that such a connection exists." 


Villa said yesterday he has filed an appeal of that dismissal
with the Appellate Division of Superior Court. 


Beyond censure, the commission could have reprimanded, suspended
or removed Arocho from the school board.

>him in his decision").  The interpretative statement
>should "get to the heart of the matter as understood

Toast
By Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman

About six years ago, a friend gave us a toaster. It was a present.
The
friend bought the toaster from Williams-Sonoma, the San Francisco-based
kitchen store, with outlets in upscale malls throughout the United
States.
 
It was a modern toaster, which means first, that it was made
primarily out
of plastic instead of stainless steel, second, it had all kinds
of gizmos
on it, and third, if something goes wrong with it, in all likelihood,
because of the modern electronic devices embedded in it, you
won't be able
to fix it.
 
On these new modern toasters, you can calibrate the shade of
the toast --
you can set the toaster for lighter or darker toast.
 
Our first plastic toaster lasted about two years before it stopped
toasting.
 
Luckily, Williams-Sonoma will replace any item if you are "not
satisfied
with your purchase for any reason."
 
We took it back to the store here in Washington, D.C. and told
the sales
clerk that we received the toaster as a present purchased from
Williams-Sonoma and that the toaster wasn't working. The sales
clerk said
-- no problem, here's a new one.
 
And she handed over a brand new Kenwood Four Slice plastic toaster,
which
lasted a little longer than a year, before it stopped toasting.
So, we
took the Kenwood back and told the clerk at the store what happened
and
the clerk said -- no problem, and she handed over a new toaster
--
different make, this one was a Toastronic Ultra.
 
The following year, same problem. And same solution. We turned
in the
Toastronic Ultra and return it for a Kitchen Aid Toaster.
 
Last week, the Kitchen Aid Toaster stopped toasting on one side.
We took
it in to the Williams-Sonoma, and the clerk handed over a Cuisinart
plastic toaster.
 
The Cuisinart toaster has all kinds of features, including a
Bagel button,
a defrost button, a reheat button, the now traditional lighter
and darker
buttons, a cancel reset button, and most annoyingly, a "shade
control"
panel, which in bright red lights (just what you don't want to
see in the
morning) tells you where exactly on a scale of very light toast
to very
dark toast you have calibrated your new toaster for this morning.
 
We have a friend who is a super cautious person, but who believes
that
toasters should last a lifetime. (Forgive him -- he is from a
different
era.) So anyway, he gets one of these new plastic toasters, and
the
plastic lever falls off. Now everytime he wants toast, he throws
caution
to the wind and sticks a butter knife into the toaster's lever
slot to
hold down the lever until it clicks in.
 
Annoyed at this repeated failure of modern technology, we called
Williams-Sonoma's customer service line. The sales person answered
and we
told her our story about returning the plastic toasters periodically
to
her store. She said she didn't think she could do anything about
the
complaint. We asked -- why not just sell a toaster that lasts?
 
And she said -- we do. It's stainless steel Dualit Combi Toaster
and it
sells for $319.00. The plastic Cuisinart that we just received
sells for
$99.95.
 
"You can buy the Dualit and it will toast for you well into your
90s," she
said with a snicker.
 
In San Francisco, Williams-Sonoma spokesperson Tracy Brown told
us that
her store tries to sell the "newest and greatest" products. She
said she
checked with a buyer, and complaints about toasters breaking
down "are not
common."
 
Brown then called back to report that "we identified reliability
problems
with the Kitchen Aid and that's why we got rid of it."
 
"We really believe that the Cuisinart toaster will last," she
said.
 
Now, of course, we remember our parents' toasters -- the aluminum
Toastmasters that they toasted with -- toasters that lasted a
lifetime.
 
These classic toasters had no bagel button, no defrost button,
no reheat
button, and definitely no shade control panel.
 
You simply stuck the slices of bread into the slot, pushed down
the lever,
and waited for the toast to pop up.
 
So, with all the wonders of modern technology, why can't the
companies
make a reasonably priced toaster that lasts?
 
We put this question to Holly Smith-Berry, marketing director
at the
Columbia, Missouri based Toastmaster, the company that sold the
first pop
up toaster in 1926 (Model 1A-1) for $12.50.
 
"We get letters from our customers, wanting to send us their
old
Toastmaster toasters, telling us they love the triple loop design
on the
side of the toaster, and they are amazed at how long they have
lasted --
50 or 60 years, in some cases," Smith-Berry said. "But if you
took our
1940 steel toaster and costed it out for inflation, it would
cost $170
today."
 
She said that Toastmaster toasters today range from $10 to $30
and they
are tested to last for 12 or so years.
 
"We've seen toasters selling in Wal-Mart for $7.96," she said.
"So, if you
don't want to clean the crumbs out of your toaster, you can just
get rid
of it and buy a new one."
 
"Unfortunately, we live in a more disposable society," she says.
 
Toastmaster makes a heavy duty toaster, but it's built in Germany
by Bosch
Siemens, it's designed by Porsche, and it sells for $225.
 
The decline of the reliable, reasonably priced toaster is symbolic
of
what's gone wrong with modern society -- shoddy products, disposable
society, planned obsolescence, high-tech but no respect.
 
Shade control in, quality out.

Piscataway resident videotapes council session for TV 


Published in the Home News Tribune 8/20/00 
By ROSA CIRIANNI
STAFF WRITER

Piscataway resident Larry Halper took matters into his own hands.


After being told by the Township Council that it does not want
its meetings televised on Piscataway Community Television Center,
Channel 71 on Cablevision, he videotaped a meeting.

Council members and Mayor Helen Merolla listed reasons why they
were against televising the meetings. They said it would be too
costly, no one would be interested in watching, it would cause
too much confusion, the meetings would drag out, and people such
as Halper would use the sessions as an opportunity to showcase
their gripes.

So Halper, one of the 16 owners of Cornell Dairy Farm fighting
a plan by Piscataway and Middlesex County to condemn the farm
for open space, brought a tripod and video camera to a council
meeting on Aug. 8. He said he wanted to have the tape aired on
PCTC. But he'll have to pay PCTC to transfer his tape onto the
TV station's tapes, which would cost roughly $30, said Peter
Namen, PCTC production facilitator.

Station manager Debbe Gist has the final say over what gets aired,
Namen said, adding that to his knowledge, no one from Piscataway
has ever asked PCTC to broadcast council meetings. Gist could
not be reached for comment.

PCTC, created in 1985 through a federal government grant, is
partially funded by the township and other sponsors, Namen said.
It serves Piscataway, Bridgewater, Raritan, South Bound Brook,
Bound Brook, Middlesex, Dunellen and Somerville. And it does
not charge the public to broadcast any tapes.

First Ward Councilman Mark Hardenburg asked Township Attorney
Howard Gran at an Aug. 8 council meeting about Piscataway's laws
and guidelines for video cameras at meetings. The council has
a list of 14 regulations for video-camera use that were adopted
two years ago after former Republican Township Council candidate
Ray Capone in 1997 did the same thing as Halper - set up a video
camera on a tripod. Officials claimed Capone's efforts were distracting
during the meetings.

The council's taping rules range from requiring that someone
wanting to tape the meeting contact the township clerk by 4 p.m.
on the Friday before the Tuesday meeting to setting a limit of
no more than one person with a video camera. The rules, however,
do not apply to swearing-in ceremonies or award presentations.

"If Piscataway taped all of its meetings, any nutcase in the
state who would get on free TV would get attracted to that,"
Hardenburg said.

Merolla said she doesn't have a problem with anyone videotaping
council meetings as long as they record the entire meeting and
do not use it for "grandstanding," as she said political candidates
often do. The majority of other officials agree: They don't want
their meetings to turn into a "circus" or have the public feel
uncomfortable about discussing issues at meetings because they
do not want to be on TV.

But according to Deborah Jacobs, executive director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the public has the right
to record with a video camera or tape recorder any public meeting,
for as long or as short a time they wish.

"When you are in a public place you should assume, 'I do not
have a right to privacy,' " Jacobs said. "The public has an obligation
to hold the government accountable and there could be many good
reasons for videotaping. How it is used is a totally separate
question."

Splicing a videotape and manipulating it for a public advertisement
would likely not be covered legally, she said. But that concern
on the part of some Piscataway officials, including 2nd Ward
Councilman Brian C. Wahler,e seems problematic to Jacobs.

"You could do doctoring of the tapes," Wahler said. "That was
a consistent concern of the council back when we did the regulations.
How do we know that it (the video) hasn't been edited. I mean
that's legitimate."

Clara Halper, Larry Halper's wife, said her family would like
to videotape council meetings and have PCTC broadcast them. But
she thinks the council should do it, and contends the money would
be well-spent. 

"Not many people get to see what goes on at town meetings because
people are so busy these days, working two jobs and with kids.
So maybe if they could turn it on at home, they would watch,"
Clara Halper said.

Attorney Arlene M. Turinchak of the McGimpsey & Cafferty law
firm in Somerset, which represents the New Jersey Press Association,
said there's nothing in the law that prohibits private citizens
from videotaping public meetings and they have a right to do
so under the state's Open Public Meetings Act of 1963.

The state Superior Court Appellate Division in 1984 upheld a
decision that entitles people to videotape public proceedings,
including criminal trials and school board meetings, as long
as the equipment is not distracting, obtrusive or disruptive.


Municipal officials, like judges in courts, can make rules limiting
the amount of video cameras, where they are positioned, their
lighting, the activity and location of the operator, and when
the cameras should be turned off. Jacobs gave the example of
a school board turning a video camera off when discussing a student
in public. 

Gran, the Piscataway township attorney, said there are no prohibitions
on videotaping council meetings, but the guidelines must be met.

GOP mayoral candidate Chris Lombard -- who is running in November
against Wahler, a Democrat, and Merolla, a Democrat vying as
an independent candidate -- has asked officials to have council
meetings aired on PCTC for years.

"If you're going to have a public-access channel, you should
be using it as a public service," Lombard said. "If you're not
afraid of anything, why not just televise the entire meeting?"

NEW BRUNSWICK: Public housing failing 


Published in the Home News Tribune 8/21/00 

Four sites fail U.S. inspection
By FRANCES CARROLL
STAFF WRITER

The New Brunswick Homes high rises received a rock-bottom score
on a recent "advisory" federal building inspection report, and
the New Brunswick Housing Authority's three other public housing
developments also came in well below the minimum passing score.

The 245-unit Homes, which were approximately 63 percent vacant
as of last week in anticipation of being demolished as part of
the federal Hope VI project to relocate tenants to low-density
housing, received a score of 1 on the federal Department of Housing
and Urban Development's Public Housing Assessment System.

The minimum passing score is 18 out of a possible 30 points.

The 59-unit senior Hoffman Pavilion building scored 4.6, the
200-unit Schwartz Homes scored 10.3 and the 59-unit Robeson Village
scored 14.1, according to HUD's recent management review of the
New Brunswick Housing Authority.

Robert Kaplan, a spokesman at HUD's Newark office, said this
is the first year local public housing authorities were rated
under a new assessment system so scores are "considered advisory
at this time. They are not final, they are subject to change."

Kaplan declined to discuss New Brunswick's particular scores.
NBHA Executive Director Kevin Quince declined to comment beyond
stating that all deficiencies cited by HUD have been or will
soon be addressed under the corrective action plan the authority
has submitted to HUD.

The physical inspection scores were included in a report on a
management review of the authority that HUD gave Board of Commissioners
Chairwoman Beatrice Harris in May. Conducted in February, the
"Limited Management Review" was designed to assess the authority's
overall performance and compliance with regulations.

The management review did not include details about building
violations and deficiencies, and the actual physical inspection
report was not immediately available.

But the review stated the authority had already certified it
corrected several "life-threatening findings" cited in an earlier
review. Those findings included a disconnected hot water vent
hood, inoperable/missing smoke detectors, exposed electrical
wires and blocked emergency exits/fire escapes. The review did
not state when or at which developments these findings were recorded.

HUD required the authority to address all the findings in the
physical inspection report, with the exception of those for the
Homes because they are scheduled for demolition.

"However, the NBHA is reminded that it must make all necessary
repairs to ensure the New Brunswick Homes site is maintained
in a safe, decent and sanitary condition . . . until all tenants
have been relocated," according to the review.

The authority filed a corrective action plan that applied only
to Schwartz Homes, Robeson Village and Hoffman Pavilion.

For the Schwartz-Robeson area, the plan stated the authority
will spend some $76,000 to repair paved areas, $31,000 to landscape,
and another $8,800 to remove old playground equipment and repair
fencing.

In Hoffman Pavilion, damaged ceilings and walls in the community
room are expected to be repaired as part of an overall $20,000
renovation scheduled this fall. Other common areas and the entrance
to Hoffman Pavilion are being renovated under a previously awarded
contract.

The action plan also addressed problems in other categories,
including aesthetic issues such as graffiti and litter, doors
and window screens, apartment interiors and building systems
such as heating, electrical and fire safety.

Hi everyone.

Our last youth league is this Sunday August 27. We had a great summer with 
the kids and will return next year, with an even better program. Thanks 
again to all the volunteers.

We are having a party for the last day for parents and the kids, so I am 
putting out this message, if you know of any way to get cheap or free food 
(a friendly, sympathetic pizza place owner for example)or party favors, it 
would be greatly appreciated. Also if anyone can volunteer their time to 
take pitures and/or videotape our party that would be great.

We will meet again at the office at 149 Redmond at 2pm. Hope to see you 
there.

This will be your last message about youth league from me until next year. 
Please don't cry.

>Top 10 Lies About West Nile Virus and Anvil
>by Robert Lederman
>
>1. THE ONLY SIDE-EFFECTS OF ANVIL EXPOSURE ARE
>COUGHING, STUFFY NOSE, ITCHING AND WATERY
>EYES
>Exactly like an allergic reaction to pollen, these responses to the
>toxic ingredients of Anvil are an attempt by a person's immune
>system to flush the substances from the body. Mucus nasal
>secretions, tears and coughing to expel the irritant from the lungs
>are not the harmful effects of exposure but are simply proof that
>the body recognizes Anvil as something it wants to get rid of
>immediately. The symptoms of a disease are not the effects of a
>disease. If you have emphysema from cigarette smoking you may
>feel tired and have difficulty breathing. In response, you might
>use an inhaler and temporarily breath better, but that would
>hardly mean you had recovered from the disease or from
>permanent damage to your lung tissue.
>
>The suspected and in many cases already proven long term
>effects of exposure to Pyrethrins like Anvil include immune
>system and liver damage, endocrine disruption, proliferation of
>breast cancer cells, lowered sperm count and cognitive
>difficulties. The latest science concerning this finds that at even
>the most minimal exposure serious health effects and endocrine
>disruption have been observed. The real damage from exposure to
>these chemicals won't be manifested until long after the itching,
>runny nose or coughing have stopped. By then, few people will
>remember or be able to prove the connection between exposure
>and their illness. Chemical companies, just like cigarette
>manufacturers, depend on this time lag between exposure and
>illness to prevent them from being found liable.
>
>2. WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV) IS A DEADLY DISEASE
>The Mayor and the media keep referring to WNV as a deadly
>disease transmitted by killer mosquitoes. Yet, they qualify these
>claims by saying that WNV is very hard to become infected by
>and that most people who do get infected recover without any
>treatment and without experiencing any symptoms. So which is
>it, a deadly infectious disease, or very mild and hard to become
>infected by? It can't be both.
>
>According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) the largest
>known WNV epidemic in history occurred in Romania in 1996.
>Approximately 100,000 people allegedly became infected. About
>400 of those people became ill with symptoms of encephalitis.
>Only 15 of those people, all of whom were over 65, died.
>Considering the level of health care in that country and the poor
>nutritional status and immune health of its senior citizens, these
>statistics indicate that the virus is much less dangerous than the
>common cold. See:  (www.naba.org/wnvirus.html). In NYC
>according to the Department of Health's own study, of the four
>NYC residents who they claim died last year from WNV, three
>were taking immunosuppresant cancer drugs and the fourth was
>HIV-positive...meaning that only people with severely
>compromised immune systems die from WNV and that even in
>those cases death is rare. [See: New York City Department of
>Health, West Nile Virus: A Briefing, City Health Information
>Vol. 19, No. 1 (May 2000)
>http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/html/chi/chi.html]
>
>3. SEVEN PEOPLE DIED LAST YEAR FROM WNV
>Every Giuliani press release and every news report prominently
>mentions that seven people died in the general NYC area last
>year from WNV. Like the Mayor's crime statistics or the Federal
>government's claims that the economy has never been better these
>statements are unverifiable. No name, blood sample or tissue
>sample of any person who allegedly died from WNV has been
>made available to independent scientists for confirmation and
>testing. Every claim of an infected bird, mosquito or human is
>based on reports by the NYC Department of Health or scientists
>that work for the CDC or receive funding from them. These are
>also the same exact source of the spray policy, creating a perfect
>loop of "proof" justifying their own decision to spray. In science
>an outside independent source verifying the conclusions and
>reproducing experimental results is always necessary before any
>statement can be taken as a fact. The same is generally true in
>law, in journalism and in business. See the end of this report for
>an analysis of the reliability of the CDC in this matter.
>
>4. THE PESTICIDE BEING USED, ANVIL, IS NATURAL
>Anvil is a synthetic imitation of a naturally occurring substance
>found in Chrysanthemums. The natural version, which is
>considered much safer than the synthetic, is far more expensive
>and is not being used anywhere in NYC. This information is
>plainly stated in the Mayor's press releases yet he stands up at
>press conferences directly contradicting it-a good indication of
>his truthfulness on the entire WNV issue. Most of the numerous
>other ingredients in Anvil are synthetic derivatives of
>petroleum-based chemicals such as Benzene and Piperonyl
>Butoxide. Many of these ingredients are on the EPA's list of
>dangerous, toxic and cancer causing substances. They are about
>as far from natural as you can get.
>
>5. ANVIL IS SAFE AND NON-TOXIC
>It is illegal in NY State to describe any pesticide as safe. If you
>examine the actual texts of the Mayor's safety claims within his
>press releases you will find that each one is qualified by terms
>like "relatively safe", "less toxic than" and "safe when used
>according to directions". The EPA studies on which pesticide
>safety claims are based are done solely by the pesticide
>manufacturers themselves, who have an obvious conflict of
>interest in this regard. The term safe as used in these studies is
>very misleading, as a reading of the studies themselves makes
>clear. A determination of safe is reached by feeding rats the
>chemical or exposing them to its vapors. When only 50% of the
>rats die, the substance is classified as safe. Every study that
>concludes that products like Anvil are safe includes reports of
>tumors in rats, developmental problems in young rats,
>miscarriages and deformities to name just a few health effects. As
>long as less than 50% of the rats get these symptoms the product
>is considered safe. Since human testing of this kind is illegal
>there is no way to tell, short of massively spraying a population
>as is being done in NYC, what the effects will be on humans.
>[See: Cover Story, Kids At Risk 6/19/2000 US News and World
>Report
>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/000619/poison.htm
>Also see: http://www.nih.gov/]
>
>6. ANVIL DISSIPATES BY THE NEXT MORNING
>Mayor Giuliani claims, and the media dutifully repeats, that
>these pesticides dissipate within two hours of being sprayed.
>These claims are deliberately deceptive. As chemical compounds
>are exposed to air and sunlight they undergo numerous changes.
>Malathion for example become Maloxon a very different
>substance which is more than 20 times as toxic. It is true to say
>the Malathion is gone-but what remains in its place is far worse.
>The claim of dissipation is based on ideal conditions-Anvil on a
>glass slide in direct sunlight-that have little if anything to do
>with the actual conditions in NYC. Much of the spraying was
>done on damp, even rainy days-in direct violation of the
>manufacturer's instructions. Much of the chemical is deposited in
>shady areas, on leaves, in cracks and crevices, in A/C filters, in
>heating vents and in countless other places where there is no
>direct sunlight. Much of it is tracked or drifts into people's
>homes where it can persist for weeks, months or years waiting to
>be inhaled, eaten or absorbed through the skin. The idea that
>people can enter a public park, jog, picnic and lay on grass that
>was massively sprayed just two hours before without receiving
>direct exposure is absurd. Children playing in that grass and then
>putting their hands in their mouths might just as well have been
>lined up and given a sample of Anvil to drink.
>
>7. ANVIL KILLS MOST OF THE MOSQUITOES
>The most ironic aspect of the spray policy is that, contrary to the
>Mayor's claims, it does not kill most of the mosquitoes. If it did,
>the earth, which has endured billions of tons of pesticide
>exposure, would already be mosquito-free. The opposite is true.
>Pesticide spraying, according to the NY State Department of
>Health and even the pesticide manufacturers, directly results in
>new generations of pesticide-resistant mosquitoes.
>
>For those like Mayor Giuliani who missed the past hundred years
>of science, this process is called natural selection. In insects,
>natural selection can occur in a period of days, weeks or months
>because each generation only lives a short time. Reproduction by
>even one genetically pesticide-resistant mosquito can result in
>hundreds of resistant offspring who then mate and create an
>entire population with that same genetic quality. Studies done in
>Florida where there is a much more severe mosquito problem,
>found a 1500% increase in mosquitoes after spraying, virtually
>all of whom were now pesticide-resistant. Even worse, many
>mosquito experts believe the immune suppression pesticides
>cause in all living things makes mosquitoes, birds and humans
>far more vulnerable to encephalitis infections. Apparently, only
>mosquitoes exposed to pesticides can get and transmit the
>infection due to damage to their stomach lining. Driving spray
>trucks past the fronts of rows of apartment houses to kill
>mosquitoes breeding in the backyards is about as effective as
>shooting a gun in the opposite direction of a target and hoping it
>will circumvent the entire earth to strike the target from behind. It
>is however, an excellent technique to guarantee an increase in
>mosquitoes, dead birds and encephalitis infections thereby
>justifying more and more spraying. See
>http://www.chem-tox.com/brevard/index.htm
>
>8. WE ARE SAVING LIVES BY SPRAYING-IF WE DIDN'T,
>MANY MORE PEOPLE WOULD GET SICK
>The CDC's own studies found that NYC's 1999 so-called WNV
>epidemic had peaked and was declining more than a month
>before spraying began. See
>http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4841a3.ht
>m
>
>9. THE SPRAYING IS BEING DONE BY QUALIFIED
>PROFESSIONALS
>While the Clarke Mosquito Control Co. itself may have some
>qualified pesticide applicators the spraying in NYC is being
>done by temporary workers solicited through an ad in the NY
>Post. These untrained and unqualified workers are being paid
>$10 an hour to damage their own and everyone else's health-an
>excellent example of what Giuliani means by creating jobs. In
>direct violation of OSHA rules and the warnings on the product
>labels, none of the applicators are wearing protective clothing,
>respirators or gloves. Because of the heat, most drive the trucks
>with the windows wide open. The police escorts ordered to
>precede and follow the spray trucks are likewise totally
>unprotected and deliberately uninformed about the risks. This is
>not an oversight or an accident. If the applicators and the police
>escorts were wearing the type of protective gear required by law,
>no one would believe the Mayor's claims that the spray is safe.
>
>10. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE THE SPRAYING
>ARE ENVIRONMENTALISTS WHO CARE MORE ABOUT
>BIRDS THAN PEOPLE AND ACTIVISTS WHO OPPOSE
>ANYTHING GIULIANI DOES
>While the loudest voices in opposition to the spraying may
>include many activists and environmentalists, there are
>thousands of medical professionals in the NYC area that oppose
>the spraying. [Contact Rivka Lieber (LieberR@...) for a
>copy of a petition signed by numerous doctors and scientists
>opposed to the spraying]. The media simply refuses to interview
>any of these people preferring to use sound bites from
>uninformed NYC residents or Giuliani supporters who believe
>anything the Mayor says no matter how absurd. Many scientists
>and health professionals are understandably fearful of losing
>their jobs, grants from chemical/pharmaceutical companies and
>their professional reputation if they speak out too loudly. Most
>medical professionals work for institutions that are dependent on
>receiving money from the government, from private institutions
>like Rockefeller University, from the CDC and from corporations
>that are actually behind the spray policy and the entire WNV
>panic. For them, publicly opposing this policy could destroy
>their careers. The same goes for reporters that would like to
>expose the facts but have been instructed not to.
>
>THE CDC SAYS WE MUST SPRAY-THE CONNECTION
>BETWEEN THE CDC, THE CIA AND THE WNV ISSUE
>The CDC bases much of its information concerning international
>health issues, epidemics and communicable diseases on reports
>by the CIA-a US governmental agency whose official role
>includes the dissemination of propaganda and disinformation
>throughout the world. The CIA oversees CDC operations in areas
>classified as a potential health threat to national security.
>
>The CDC has been implicated in numerous health disasters
>involving the distribution of vaccines both in the US and in the
>third world. Many scientists and researchers believe they are the
>source for a number of diseases that never previously existed. All
>of these diseases just happen to be associated with bio-warfare
>research labs working with or run by the CDC, the CIA and/or
>the U.S. Army.
>
>The CIA has a proven track record of misinforming not only

>some US Senators now believe the CIA is largely responsible for

New Brunswick authority fails housing review �
�
08/22/00�
�
By Alexander Lane�
STAFF WRITER�
�
�
Shoddy maintenance, poor security and inadequate record keeping�
were among a long list of management problems federal officials�
have found in the New Brunswick Housing Authority, according�
to a recent management review. �
�
�
The review, based on interviews and inspections conducted by�
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development officials�
in February, was the source of the recent revelation that the�
authority does not have a resident on its board of commissioners.�
�
�
�
But that was just one of many problems federal officials unearthed.�
�
�
�
The officials reviewed annual inspection reports and found that�
each of the city's four public housing units was in dismal physical�
condition. �
�
�
Out of a maximum score of 30, with 18 as a passing grade, Robeson�
Village scored 14.1, the Schwarz Homes scored 10.3, Hoffman Pavilion�
scored 4.6 and the New Brunswick Memorial Homes scored 1.0. �
�
�
''The inspectors they send don't communicate with my staff,"�
complained Kevin Quince, director of the authority. �
�
�
''They say they went into the boiler room and found a fuse box�
was open. That's a deduction. You got a shingle missing on the�
roof, one of the drain spouts isn't pouring water out when it�
rains. Those are deductions. It's that kind of painstaking analysis."�
�
�
�
Quince said many other public housing directors have complained�
about the new Physical Housing Assessment System, which is performed�
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Real Estate�
Assessment Center. �
�
�
The New Brunswick Housing Authority manages about 500 apartments�
for lower income families. �
�
�
The review also found that too many rents were uncollected. Some�
20 percent of tenants, including the authority's public housing�
manager, had delinquent accounts as of the end of last year,�
according to the review. �
�
�
The authority has set up formal repayment agreements, but it�
has not been following up on them, the review found. �
�
�
Quince countered in his written response to the federal officials�
that "the authority's collection policy and procedure is standard�
and effective for the majority of our residents." �
�
�
Officials also criticized the authority for keeping two waiting�
lists -- one dating back to 1990 and one compiled after a housing�
lottery in 1997. �
�
�
The authority did not properly keep track of applications. In�
some cases, they housed residents on the more recent waiting�
list before applicants that had been waiting since 1990, the�
review found. �
�
�
Quince said the authority has since examined the 1990 list, housed�
any applicants still in need of housing and purged the old list.�
�
�
�
Drug dealing continues to infest the complexes, officials found.�
�
�
�
The Schwarz-Robeson complexes have become a "passageway to escape�
from drug enforcement agents," and drug dealers were working�
openly outside the Memorial Homes complex, officials said. �
�
�
Quince said the authority increased security patrols at the Memorial�
Homes -- but he acknowledged that the drug market continues to�
thrive on public housing property. He said he would schedule�
a meeting with federal officials to ask for advice on fighting�
drugs. �
�
�
New Brunswick officials could not be reached for comment yesterday.�
�
�
�
Andy Gury, the spokesman for Mayor James Cahill, said he did�
not know how to reach the mayor, who was taking a three-day weekend.�
�
�
�
Calls to Joseph Schrum, the city council president, and Jimmie�
Cook, the council's liaison to the housing authority, were not�
returned. �
�
�
Quince, who has been on the job for two years and earns $95,000�
a year, remained resolute yesterday in the face of the stream�
of criticism of his management. �
�
�
''I'll be damned if I'm going to let this take me down," Quince�
said. "I distributed this to department heads and said I'm not�
satisfied with how this came out. How can you be?" �
�
�
''I use these evaluations as a management tool, as an opportunity�
to evaluate our operations." �

... additionally if you take every 17th letter from this article it says 
"George Bush dresses cats in polyester!" 

The exclamation point is really included. It's so weird how it all comes 
together.

For the record, most chemical development comes from Germany because that was 
one of the emerging industries in the 19th century that required very few 
natural resources from colonial conquests. The American chemical industry 
really only started to kick butt when Caruthers from DuPont discovered ( in 
the '30's) a workakable polyester ( for example, Nylon). Before that Baklite 
was the only synthetic material. 

Let us not attack Republicans on this e-mail please.

GLOBAL CRITICAL MASS AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING!!!
  SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 19TH, 2000, 2PM(your time)

  This is during the international global warming
talks in The Hague, Netherlands.

  PLEASE FORWARD/SHARE THIS MESSAGE TO ALL    
BIKE/ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS/INDIVIDUALS AROUND THE  
WORLD!!!

  On Sunday, November 19th, 2000, cyclists from around
Europe will converge in The Hague, Netherlands for a
special Critical Mass Against Global Warming. Join
them in solidarity by organizing a Critical Mass  
Bike Ride in your community on that day.  Rally
support for the ratification of a strong Kyoto
Protocol, the international treaty that would be the
first step to stopping global warming!  The Kyoto
Protocol will be the main topic of discussion at this
November�s Global Warming Summit in The Hague,
Netherlands.  Join fellow cyclists from around the
world for a Global Critical Mass to protest global
warming and the fossil fuel companies that keep it
going, and promote two of the best solutions � a
strong Kyoto Protocol and the Bicycle!!! 

  This November 11-24, 180 countries will gather in
The Hague, Netherlands, for two weeks of talks on how
to deal with global warming.  This is the sixth such
meeting.  The Kyoto Protocol was named after Kyoto,
Japan, where the third meeting took place.  The Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro was the first. 

  In addition to celebrating the bicycle, and
promoting the Kyoto Protocol let's protest the big
oil/coal/car companies that are against
Kyoto.  In a similar Critical Mass this past Earth Day
in California we rode around a Chevron Gas Station for
half an hour, blocking the station and handing out
literature.  We got great media coverage, so
send out those press releases.  Good signs are
crucial!
Noisemakers/instruments are fun too.  

  Suggestions for signs: Ratify the Kyoto Treaty!,
Kyoto Now!,  Don't Weaken Kyoto!, Support Global
Warmin-Drive Y'r Car!, Nukes aren't the Answer!, Go
Solar! Stop Global Warming!, Stop Climate Change!,
Boycott Gasoline!, ExxonMobil Supports
Global Warming, Chevron Supports the GCC, Bikes are
Better!, etc. GCC stands for Global Climate Coalition.
(see Corporate Opposition below). It's easy to tape
signs (approx. 1 square meter size) to bike
racks, one on each side. Target politicians and fossil
fuel/car companies on your ride. Tell the press. Bring
cameras. Riding safely and respectfully will get the
message across better. Hope you join us! 
  Have fun!!


  Background Information:
   
  Global warming is one of the most serious
environmental threats facing the planet today. In
1995, 2,400 of the world�s leading scientists on
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
reviewed the bulk of peer reviewed climate science and
concluded that: �the balance of evidence suggests a
discernible human influence on global climate.� The
IPCC estimated that if greenhouse gas emissions
continue to increase at current rates, the earth could
experience a temperature increase of 3-6 degrees over
the next 100 years. Some of the impacts of this
dramatic increase in temperature will be:
   
- Massive Forest and Species Die-Off 
- Increased Floods, Droughts, and Other Severe Weather
Events 
- Wetland and Coral Reef Destruction 
- The Spread of Tropical Diseases Such As Hantavirus,
Malaria and Dengue Fever 
-  Shifts of Agricultural and Ecosystem Belts 
-  Diminished Freshwater Supply 
-  Dramatic Sea Level Rise Causing Coastal Flooding
and Property Damage.

  Since then, tens of thousands of scientists, 2,500
economists including 7 Nobel Laureates, have made
strong statements about the need to take action to
stop global warming and that such action would
actually be good for the economy by making it more
healthy and efficient. 

  The Kyoto Protocol

  In response to the growing consensus about global
warming, over 140 nations joined together in Rio to
formulate what would later become the Kyoto Protocol �
an international treaty to cut global warming
pollution by 5% below 1990 levels. (U.S. emissions
have increased 13% since �90) After years of
negotiation, Kyoto was finally signed by the
United States and 170 other nations, however, it has
yet to be ratified by the U.S. Senate.  The Kyoto
Protocol is not the ultimate solution to global
warming but is a crucial first step.  If Kyoto were
enacted today the U.S. would have to reduce its CO2
emissions by 20%, which is significant.

  Corporate Opposition

  At the same time that the leaders of the world were
signing the Kyoto Protocol, an industry front group
called the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was gearing
up a $13 million dollar ad campaign in the U.S. to
kill the Protocol, saying that there is not enough
scientific certainty about global warming to justify
action. Because of this the U.S. Senate has not
ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and without the world�s
biggest polluter ratifying this treaty it is unlikely
that other nations will either. The public relations
war has so far, unfortunately, been won by the
utility, fossil fuel, and auto industries which fund
the Global Climate Coalition�s efforts to undermine
the scientific consensus about global warming and to
stop every common sense solution to climate change. 
What is needed is a Nation/Earth-wide grassroots
movement to put pressure on the U.S. Senate for a
strong Kyoto Protocol and to expose the corporate
misinformation campaign. 

  Recently, the Kyoto Treaty has come under attack
from the nuclear and timber industries as well.  They
are seeking language in the treaty that will encourage
construction of a new wave of nuclear power plants
and the clear-cutting of old growth forests replanted
with allegedly more  "vigorous" new trees. A strong
Kyoto treaty is critical.  To send a fax to US
negotiators, visit http://www.cooltheplanet.org.
    
  So, tell all your friends, organize, and this
November 19th, �get your ass on down to the Global
Warming Critical Mass!!�

Message:

For Immediate Release:

The Peoples' Council
      C/0 808 S.10th St.
      Newark, N.J.   07108

      On Thurs, Sept 14, 2000, THE PEOPLES' COUNCIL will present A CELEBRITY 
AUCTION, at the new and much talked about CLUB MILLENNIUM, 64 Clay St. 
Newark. Between the hours of  6pm to 12 pm.
	The CELEBRITY AUCTION will present a large variety of very valuable items 
from an impressive list of celebrities, some of whom will attend.  Unique, 
many one of kind articles will be offered from internationally known 
celebrities like MAYA ANGELOU, SHAQUIL O'NEAL, NINA SIMONE, MAX ROACH, 
QUINCY JONES, BILL COSBY, WARREN BEATTY, FELIPE LUCIANO, AMIRI BARAKA, DANNY 
GLOVER, WESLEY SNIPES, ALONZO MOURNING, RUSSELL SIMMONS, PUFFY COOMBS, 
SAVION GLOVER AND OTHERS.
.	The proceeds from the auction will be used to continue a campaign by The 
Peoples' Council  for  increased  Voter Registration and citizen awareness 
of the principal issues that affect the Newark community and to support the 
candidacy in Newark's 2002 municipal elections of Ras Baraka, for 
Councilman-at-Large.
             Ras Baraka, 30, born in Newark, the son of long time Newark 
Artist-Activists, Amina and Amiri Baraka , an eighth grade teacher at Warren 
Street Elementary School, and a dynamic young community activist will head 
this campaign as part of the Peoples' Democratic Council's public campaign 
to alert the people of Newark, and people everywhere, to the growing 
challenge to Democracy being made by the extreme right wing upsurge of 
groups like the Ku Klux Klan, Skin Heads, and other racist and white 
supremacist groups proliferating across the United States and the world.
	The deadly assault being made on the people by such forces has all but 
eliminated Affirmative Action, coopted commercialized and corrupted popular 
US culture, brought the deadly resurgence of Killer Cops, Police Brutality, 
such as the Earl Faison murder in Orange, outrages like NYC police execution 
  Diallo in a hail of forty one bullets, the lynching of     Byrd in Texas, 
the continued burning of Black churches in the south, recent growingly 
ubiquitous  marches by outspoken white supremacists in Morristown, the 
federal government's confirmation of New Jersey's infamous Racial Profiling, 
the elimination of Citizens' democratic rights such as the ban on Citizens 
speaking in Newark City Council,  the state's illegal and undemocratic take 
over of public schools  (now found in 24 states) which has resulted  in the 
disappearance of millions of dollars of public moneys but  not one trace of 
improvement to the education system.
              The frenzy of privatization of public institutions and 
services, with disastrous results such as the complete breakdown of the NJ 
Motor Vehicle Agency under the completely incompetent misadministration of 
private corporations at the expense of the state's people, allowing still 
more resources to be removed from the public treasury, like the huge give 
away tax cuts to the wealthy so that the state has to borrow money from the 
banks to pay for public services thereby further enriching corporate America 
while eliminating public democratic governance.
and dismantling the so-called citizen "safety net" of democratic services 
and institutions.
	Admission to the Celebrity Auction is $30 general admission, $60 VIP 
seating. For further information call  Peoples' Council     973-242-1346

Subject:Seizing Power in New Brunswick
Message:



Attention all Cultural Activists:

The New Brunswick People�s Campaign is a coalition of student and community 
activists from New Brunswick who have formed an independent political party. 
  We are running three candidates for New Brunswick City Council in the 
November elections.

Our platform reflects the needs of students and the people of New Brunswick. 
  It was built with over 1,000 surveys conducted door-to-door, over 200 of 
which were filled out by students from Rutgers, Cook, and Douglass College.  
We will establish real rent control and promote music and culture throughout 
the city.  We will end all unfair ticketing (parking, trash, parties, etc.)  
We will build a women�s center.  We will establish an All-Elected Police 
Control Board with students and neighborhood representatives.  We will end 
the environmental devestation of New Brunswick�s waterways and 
neighborhoods.  We will build public pools and establish youth services, as 
well as tear down the walls that divide campus and community and make New 
Brunswick a safe and enjoyable place for all.  This is just a small part of 
a much a much larger revolutionary-democratic program that is the basis of 
our campaign - the needs and interests of the diverse people of our city.

Our candidates, Curtis Warren, Diego Morales, and Keith Joseph, were elected 
at a New Brunswick wide convention and have pledged to hold up the platform 
and the will of the people.

We need all the help we can get from student and community activists.  We 
need all organzaitions to register their members and contacts to vote in New 
Brunswick.  We need to turn out thousands of student to vote with the 
thousands of New Brunswick supporters on election day.  We are aiming to 
turn this city into a progressive stronghold and center for social justice.

We must unite - African-American, Latino, and Euro-American... men and 
women... students and community residents to ensure that the needs of all 
are met. That is what democracy is all about.  What we have now, at Rutgers 
and in New Brunswick, is the rule of the few over the many.  We have decided 
not to accept this. The city is going to change hands.

Please contact me by replying to this email or call me at home 732-729-0873 
for more information of to get involved.

In Unity,
Tom DeGloma

Hi, LEggles

Beverly Marshall is still in danger of eviction from
her NB Apartments (Oct. 1).

She did get a very short, unhelpful letter from Mr.
Soaries.  Commended her work as a grandmother and
suggested she contact the Kinship Navigator program
for advice.  ("The New Jersey Department of Human
Services createdthe Kinship Navigator Program to help
kinship caregivers navigate their way through the
various governmental systems to find local supports
and resources".)  And that was it.

HUD has sent her case to the HUD office in Trenton,
whatever that means.  They are suppose to contact her
but haven't yet.

thanks so much for your interest.  We may have to do a
rally in the next couple of weeks in her support. 
Beverly also wants to focus on the infringement of her
freedom of speech (over the sign on her door) and the
lower expectations of quality of life at her
complex(given the prohibition on lawn furniture).

other letters to the editor would help a lot (mine was
published Sat. in the HNT).  I will keep you posted.

Subject:Better than a Cup of Java
Message:

For those who keep posting leftist lines ... 



www.goreline.com

The Gore Line is a great resource for those attempting to follow Al
Gore's daily reinventions and frequent flip-flops on the issues.  

Last Sunday Governor Bush challenged Al Gore to join him for three
debates he had already agreed to - one sponsored by the Presidential
Debate Commission, one on a special edition of NBC's "Meet the Press,"
and one on a special edition of CNN's "Larry King Live."  True to form,
Al Gore ducked the Governor's challenge - and in doing so, revealed once
again that every word out of his mouth must be taken with large grains of
salt.

On Tuesday, in Pennsylvania, Governor Bush announced a detailed plan to
reform Medicare and provide prescription drug benefits to those seniors
in need.  Based as it is on a comprehensive reform of the Medicare system
- a system which is going broke - the Governor's plan sets up a clear
contrast with Gore's plan, which (like Hillary Clinton's failed 1993
gambit to nationalize the health care delivery system) relies on a Big
Government, bureaucrats-decide, one-size-fits-none prescription.

Wednesday, the Governor spoke to the American Legion - an audience
stiffed by Al Gore, much to the displeasure of the veterans in
attendance, who pointed out that it was the first time in history that a
presidential
candidate had failed to address them. 

New advertisement, entitled "Let's see/education," which challenges
Gore's credibility as a result of the 1996 Clinton/Gore fund-raising
scandal - a scandal that, when investigated, resulted in 22 indictments,
12 convictions, 70 people taking the Fifth Amendment, and 18 witnesses
fleeing the country.  After highlighting that sorry record, the ad pivots
to a discussion of Gore's promises to bring accountability to our
nation's schools - accountability that would be reached somehow (not
surprisingly, Gore doesn't say how) without testing.

Hello,

For those of you who aren't on the Rutgers campuses frequently enough 
to pick up a copy of the Targum, Tom's recent mass email was printed 
today as a 'Guest Editorial'.  It appears to have been reprinted 
verbatim, but I might be wrong.  Also, there was an article a few
days 
ago -- on the 7th -- about a poll of NB residents by Eagleton that
may 
interest some people.  It is available in the "Archive" section of
the 
Targum's website, if you simply choose "News Articles" and "Sep. 7".  
I wrote a short letter in response to this.  Unfortunately, it got 
sort of screwed up by whomever edited it.

In any case, you can get the Targum online at www.dailytargum.com.

Hi,
I was actually called for that Eagleton poll.  If you have any questions
about what they asked me you can just e-mail me.  I actually was
disappointed in the article because they left out a lot of things (big

Hello --

Yeah, what struck me about the article was that the person who wrote 
it didn't seem to really recognize the poll as being in any 
way 'political'.  It read like one of those 'Good News' articles that 
are used as filler in those local 'Community Shopper' advertisement-
newspapers.

I'm really curious to see how the survey was structured, what 
questions were asked and how, etc.  I'm sure someone will get back to 
you if they're writing something about the survey for whatever 
publication, newspaper, op-ed piece, etc.  I myself have been sort of 
out of the loop lately due to some academic commitments that should 
loosen a bit come next weekend, so I don't know what's up and what's 
down, in terms of the activities of the campaign.

Are you the person from RSU, btw?

TTYL,

Jeremy

Sounds interesting.  Let me know if anyone has any ideas as to 
whether and how to throw something together relating to the poll, or 
in response to it.  I'm pretty pressed for time until Friday, but at 
that point, I'd be happy to help a little.

Hi, LEggles

Beverly Marshall is still in danger of eviction from
her NB Apartments (Oct. 1).

She did get a very short, unhelpful letter from Mr.
Soaries.  Commended her work as a grandmother and
suggested she contact the Kinship Navigator program
for advice.  ("The New Jersey Department of Human
Services createdthe Kinship Navigator Program to help
kinship caregivers navigate their way through the
various governmental systems to find local supports
and resources".)  And that was it.

HUD has sent her case to the HUD office in Trenton,
whatever that means.  They are suppose to contact her
but haven't yet.

thanks so much for your interest.  We may have to do a
rally in the next couple of weeks in her support. 
Beverly also wants to focus on the infringement of her
freedom of speech (over the sign on her door) and the
lower expectations of quality of life at her
complex(given the prohibition on lawn furniture).

other letters to the editor would help a lot (mine was
published Sat. in the HNT).  I will keep you posted.

Anne

Tom and anyone else,

You may wish to add "Asian" to the usual list of 'racial' groups to

in

As a matter of lesser importance -- I would tend to oppose wheeling

Brian,

  I have 'acquired' a house on Paper St. for just this purpose.
In addition I have a ficticious corporate account set up with

taking this discussion off line.  We should not talk of this in public.

Hey Matthew,
           I have a few concerns regarding your opinion. Though you do bring 
up
valid points in your opinion, there were parts of the column, where the 
message
of your opinion gets lost. If you could just reword your opinion so that you
state the message clearly at the top of your column, that would give people 
a
better sense of what to expect from your opinion. Also, even though you make 
a
valid point about architects, I believe that your column leans towards 
attacking
Eisenman, rather than making the point that he did not care about the 
community
in New Brunswick. Please reword it so that you can better get your point 
accross
to the readers. If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail the managing
editor at fjo8185@....
Thank you
Keerti Chivakula
Editor-in-chief






Dear Mr. Smith,
    Whether you feel that we are crticizing you is not the point. While your
opinions outline is good you spend most of it insulting a fellow human 
being.
The Vector is not an outlet for a persons gripe with someone else. If you
wish to write for the paper then I seriously recommend you change your tone.
Also, do not criticize the work of John Messenger [racist, right wing, 
columninst for Vector--MS]  for the only garbage that
I see here is that so called opinion of yours.

p.s.- If that wasn't clear enough for you, we're not putting in your 
opinion!

CENSORSHIP AT NJIT/VECTOR!

	The Editor in Chief and Managing Editor of the only campus newspaper at 
NJIT has decided to censor an article of mine for the first issue of this 
semester.  This sets a disturbing tone, suggesting that Freedom of Speech is 
not guaranteed at NJIT.
	College campuses have long been hotbeds of intellectual debate and 
political dissension, playing a historic role for Social Change and claim a 
legacy of Civil Rights struggle in the United States.  More directly, this 
is Newark��The Brick City�--not some isolated country club on Ivy Hill.  
People have been struggling for social justice in Newark for longer than 
most of us here have been alive.  The Editors of the Vector need to get hip 
to this fact and cut with the sophomoric stunts.  The Vector office is not 
their private pizza den, though the paper�s embarrassing lack of substance 
in the past might suggest this.  The Managing Editor went as far as 
demanding that I not criticize John Messenger (see below), the Vector�s 
darling right-wing columnist last year, whose backwards, racist, Dixie-flag 
waving trash talk was vehemently defended in the name of Free Speech by the 
same paper that now wants to censor my thoughts and words.
	The great irony is that my article was titled �The Students Pen VS the 
Master�s Sword,� written on behalf of Architect Peter Eisenman, who, at a 
lecture appearance last spring, ordered his audience to put down their pens, 
threatening to embarrass any perpetrators with expulsion from the lecture 
hall!!!  This is my second year at NJIT, and I�m deeply concerned about 
casual attitude some folks seem to have regarding another�s right to form 
independent and progressive thought!  I call upon the students to email the 
Vector, or stop in on their office on the second floor of the Student 
Center, and demand that they stop the censorship & print my article, 
word-for-word.  Finally, it is my hope that once we get past the issue of 
censorship, we cen get down to a much needed and energetic debate as to the 
merits of Peter Eisanman's work, etc.
	IT�S TIME FOR FREE AND INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AT NJIT!
Send letters  to the.vector@...  (please CC to me, as well)

Matthew Smith
Architecture Student�3rd year
vivaohio@...


THIS ARTICLE HAS NOT REACHED SOME PEOPLE, BECAUSE OF ERRORS in the 
ATTACHMENT.


The Student�s Pen vs. the Master�s Sword


Let�s begin by taking care of some unresolved business.  Last year, the 
School of Architecture was graced with the presence of a Newark native and 
deconstructivist luminary, Peter Eisenman.  No need for introduction�accept 
to relay my first personal encounter with him:  He began his lecture in 
Weston Lecture Hall by telling me to put my pen down.  In fact he told us 
all to put our pens down, and if anyone didn�t comply he would embarrass 
them by ordering them to leave.  Nice.
	I imagine that most people complied because his talk went on uninterrupted, 
even when he mentioned that one of his clients is a Franco Spaniard (in 
German, that�s called a Nazi) My initial impulse, however, was to tighten my 
grip on my pen and hold on for dear life.  I can�t remember if it was 
initially an act of resistance or shock.  But regardless, as my indignation 
settled into clarity of purpose, my one thought was: the moment somebody 
orders you to put down the pen�the mightiest of weapons�you ask them, no 
matter who they are or think they are, politely�at first�where they would 
like you to stick it.  And then you start writing down his reaction so that 
everyone else knows how the story went.
	It was an unspoken test of wills.  Sitting in full view of our orator, 
front row, right-of-center, pen in hand, note book in full view, scratching 
thoughts down here and there, not to snatch his words out of the air and 
claim them as my own (which I guess was his concern)�frankly I don�t find 
much practical use for his ideas.   What I was jotting down was the question 
that I wanted to raise during the Q&A session.   I you�re wondering, he 
didn�t stop the lecture to single me out for exile.  What he did was much 
more insidious.  He refused to take my question.  And there�s no doubt that 
of all the waving hands, he accidentally missed just mine.
	O.K., Mr. Eisenman, now I will raise my question, this time with the luxury 
of preface.
You appeared New Brunswick, NJ, where I was living, a little over a year ago 
with a design concept commissioned by the City and sponsored by the Rutgers� 
arts school.   It was an inflated student center & 10,000 seat sports arena 
for Rutgers University.  The design was a predictably unpredictable sinewy 
curvilinear formless form.  Only, it was not set on Rutgers property, but 
directly on top of an entire struggling downtown community�sparing the 
church�which was already over-stressed by the �revitalization� that 
threatened to ethnically cleanse their block next, making way for the return 
of the �white-flighters.�  When the morning newspaper came out with a three 
page spread on your plan, folks were shocked, dismayed, and nearly up in 
arms.  The outrage only subsided when the city bosses distanced themselves 
from the concept by claiming that they never intended to build it.  It was 
merely a whimsical exploration of intellectual experiment. You seemed 
betrayed, and made the case that we, the people, are just not ready for such 
a vision.
So my question to you, Mr. Eisenman, is as it was last spring: What is the 
architect�s responsibility to the community in which his buildings are to 
exist?
I insist on having this addressed, because too often architecture neglects 
the very people whose lives are imposed upon by the invisible hand of the 
architect.  Mr. Eisenman, it�s not that the people of New Brunswick �didn�t 
get it�!  It�s because you apparently didn�t spend the time to get them.   I 
believe it is the job of the architect to go down to the community to find 
out its needs, its struggles, its desires.  The architect should be a public 
servant, not a lord.  There are real people whose real lives exist in that 
space between the architect�s imagination and his or her buildings.   Our 
work should reflect that.  Try it.

From my pen to you-
Matthew R. Smith, Student
NJ School of Architecture at NJIT

Subject:The Return of The Somersaulting Al Gore
Message:




The old Al Gore resurfaced this week - no doubt to the consternation of
his campaign's spinmeisters tasked with the unenviable job of trying to
explain the vice president's, ah, er, shall we say,  propensity to
prevaricate. 

Monday's Boston Globe headlined a story about Gore shamelessly lying to
senior citizens to gain political advantage.  While on a Florida campaign
swing on August 28, the Globe revealed, Gore claimed that his
mother-in-law and his dog use the same arthritis drug, Lodine - but that
his mother-in-law has to pay three times as much as the pooch.  The Globe
discovered that, in fact, the prices cited by Gore came not from personal
experience, but from a bogus "study" prepared by Democrat congressional
staffers.  Then ensued four straight days of Gore's spin doctors hemming
and hawing over whether Gore's mother-in-law and/or canine companion
really do take the drug, how much they pay - or would pay if they did
take it - and so forth, none of which supported Gore's claims. 
Meanwhile, Gore's traveling press corps is becoming increasingly
perturbed over his unwillingness to directly answer any questions from
them.

Then, on Wednesday, Walter Shapiro of USA Today reported that two days
earlier, while in Nevada to accept the endorsement of the Teamsters, Gore
had said he fondly remembered the lullabies he'd been sung in the cradle,
and then launched into a slightly off-key rendition of "Look for the
Union Label," the advertising jingle of the International Ladies Garment
Workers Union.  Problem was, as Shapiro pointed out, the jingle was
written for an ad campaign that began in 1975 - when Gore was 27 years
old. Thursday - worried about how the highest oil prices in ten years
might affect his political fortunes- Gore called on Bill Clinton to
release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Yes, this is the very
same Al Gore who, as recently as last February, explained that releasing
oil from the Reserves would be a bad move, because it would be
immediately offset by equivalent OPEC production cutbacks.  And yes, this
is the same administration whose Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers,
warned just last week that doing so "would be a major and substantial
policy mistake." It would also be a campaign contribution from Clinton to
Gore using a public resource. And what was Governor Bush doing while Gore
was stewing in his own juices?

Unveiling his Blueprint for the Middle Class - a comprehensive theme that
wraps up his education, Social Security, Medicare/prescription drug and
tax cut plans into one cohesive package - and reaching more and more
voters by appearing on the popular television shows hosted by Oprah
Winfrey and Regis Philbin.

At this point it is clear where we need to be spending our time.  We have a coalition of folks who have had enough of the corruption and arrogance in this city and have worked long and hard against it and toward forging a strong coalition.  We must respect this effort and in doing so respect the principles of our unity.  

Please, we must focus on the task at hand.  United we stand, divided we fall.

I'm not so much concerned about Al Gore's character as an individual 
as much as I am concerned about the fact that he is really a 
Republican in Democrat's guise.

Whether or not he has a dog who takes arthritis medication may 
concern those middle managers and soccer moms nation-wide who look 
for nothing more in politicians than that they conform to the value 
system put forward by the sitcom Rosanne.  

As for me, well, I don't give a flying fig.  I'm more concerned about 
who, under the possible Gore administration, is going to get bombed.  
I'm curious to know which corporations are going to get the largest 
tax breaks at the expense of the majority of people.  And I'm of 
course very interested to know how many schools will go without books 
so that the United States military can have more toys.

Who is going to pay for it, Frank?

Oprah and Regis?  How about this.  Instead of having debates, we can 
just have the candidates do puppet shows, just like Tom Tomorrow 
recently suggested.  It will be a lot more fun fer down-ta-earth 
folks like you and me.  How 'bout it?

Isn't it also funny how Bush has to constantly revise his position, 
even his character, every week or so?  

GORE AND BUSH CAN BOTH KISS MY A**

Frank- First, I agree with Zophia that we need to keep focused on the 
campaign, and not disintegrate at this point into internal tripe.  That 
said, Frank, I don't understand the nature of your charge.  Was it abusive 
of this format to inform my friends and comrades in NB, many of whom I have 
no other mode contact, that I was being censored by small minded pions at 
NJIT's only campus newspaper?  Where's the solidarity, Frank?  You said 
yourself in person last weekend that it was a clear democratic (small-d) 
issue.  Oh, well...plenty of time for this after Nov. 7- MS

Message:


I don't think it's necessarily terribly distracting to post messages 
not purely related to the campaign.  But -- Frank -- you would have 
to be demonstrating how a Bush administration would be concretely 
better in terms of the issues that the Campaign is dealing with.  
Certainly, you would have to demonstrate that there would exist more 
funding, more amenable court decisions, more programs, etc, to help 
sustain and foster local reform and activist efforts of all sorts 
(secular or church-based, for that matter) -- under a Bush 
administration.  

I would take the fairly strong stand that gossip about how 
inauthentic Al Gore is as a _character_ does not constitute political 
discussion.

All, 

I hope we realise we all have to work for the people of New Brunswick and not 
against each other by discussing the various advantages of one ideology over 
another. 

I do not want to have to respond to partisan messages here as long as no one 
else does. That can wait after Nov. 7th - or on the night of Nov. 7th and the 
Victory Celebration.

Message:

***PLEASE SEND THIS MESSAGE OUT FAR AND WIDE***

To all friends and comrades in the Newark area-

    As most of you are aware, there is a groundswell of activity in New 
Brunwsick around the November 7 Elections.  To sum up:  The NB People's 
Campaign, a broad based, multi-national, multi-class, coalition united 
around the goal of upsetting the Democratic (read: "corporate") Machine in 
the upcoming City Council election.  We have advanced a 3 person, 
multi-national ticket and a revolutionary democratic platform arrived at 
through canvassing over 1000 people prior to a public Convention held last 
April, at which the platform points and candidates were proposed, debated, 
and voted on.
    Since then, the spectrum of forces in NB working on this campaign have 
grown deeper and wider, encompassing workers, students in the NB schools as 
well as on Rutger's campuses, artists, professionals, small business owners, 
the young and the old. The momentum is unprecented:  In ONE DAY last week, 
over 500 PEOPLE on Rutgers Campus were REGISTERED TO VOTE by our canvasers 
and supporters!
    Now, we are entering the home stretch.  With little over 1 month to go, 
and knowing that we need hundreds of people in the streets election day 
working the poles, getting out the voters, etc. we are now reaching out to 
those outside New Brunswick who understand the need for a real and radical 
transformation of the institutions that are running our lives.
    IN THE SPRING OF 1998, N.J.F.O. BROUGHT 50 PEOPLE FROM NEW BRUNWICK TO 
NEWARK TO WORK ON RAS BARAKA'S BID FOR CITY COUNCIL! (an election that he 
initially won, but had stripped of him through a dubious run-off election).  
THIS TIME, LET'S SHOW THAT NEWARK IS BEHIND NEW BRUNSWICK!!!  WE CAN MATCH 
THAT EFFORT AND THEN SOME IF YOU MARK YOUR CALENDARS NOW!  NOVEMBER 
7...ELECTION DAY: 2000, WE NEED YOU IN NEW BRUNSWICK TO HELP BREAK THE 
STRANGLED-HOLD THAT THE CORRUPTED AND ROTTEN NB CITY MACHINE HAS AROUND THE 
NECKS OF NEW BRUNSWICK RESIDENTS.  If and when we win in NB, it will send 
shock waves across the state, and indeed the nation, sending the message 
that it is possible for the people to organize to take control of their own 
lives.

     We are encouraging people to come down the night before, so that we can 
get organized and stike out early.  Please RSVP-ASAP and indicate if you can 
come Monday night (Lodging will be provided) or Tuesday morning.  Further 
information will be provided, such as rides, directions, sleeping 
arrangements, etc.

For the future,
Matthew Smith

Message:

Matthew and all:

Thank you for putting out this call. I'll spread the word and we'll try to 
get some Greens to help out in the final weeks. In my opinion, we can have 
our principled disagreement over the tactic of supporting Ralph Nader or not 
in the presidential election and still agree that the New Brunswick Peoples 
Campaign is a critically important expression of independent political action 
which must be supported. i will encourage Greens to get involved.

As far as Nader is concerned, I would argue that even if you hold to the "we 
must defeat Bush" line nationally, in New Jersey Gore is now 18 points ahead 
in the latest polls. Hence, in our electoral college system, a progressive 
who votes for gore would truly be wasting a progressive vote: it doesn't 
matter a tinker's damn whether Gore wins NJ by 18 % or 19 %.

In any case, keep up the good work and we'll try to respond in force to your 
call.

Daily Targum Oct 2, 2000

Ideal candidates?

Editorial

This November, the People�s Campaign, a multiracial coalition of city 
residents, Rutgers students and community organizers, hopes to defeat the 
three City Council incumbents. Although New Brunswick�s city government has 
dire need for a change, the People�s Campaign may unfortunately not be the 
answer.

Curtis Warren, Diego Morales and Keith Joseph are running on a 17-point 
platform derived from a 1,000-person survey canvass throughout the entire 
city. They hope to address the wants and needs of the people of New 
Brunswick and not the corporate interests that the current City Council 
seems to represent. The People�s Campaign�s goals concern government reform, 
resident support services and economic development, three lenses of reform 
that the City Council must begin to look through.

However, the candidates are too idealistic. They have limited access to 
information and haven�t been able to analyze the city�s current spending. 
The programs they wish to initiate � such as job placement and training for 
all city residents, public child care for infants through pre-kindergarten 
and free or low-cost health services for city residents as a condition of 
local hospital expansions � would cause massive increases in taxes.

It is important to have citizens with diverse interests on the council. It 
is important to break up the current administration, which has dominated New 
Brunswick for decades. The People�s Campaign is a worthy cause, but it 
cannot expect to break up the current system with lofty ideals. The 
candidates need to be politicians, not dreamers. Robert Recine, Joseph 
Schrum and Jimmy Cook � the incumbents � should remain in office, not 
because of their merits as council members, but because Warren, Morales and 
Joseph do not have realistic means to achieve their goals.

Ideal candidates?

By Joe Smith
Guest Commentary

In reference to the editorial �Appointed Democracy� (The Daily Targum, Sept. 
26), the editorial staff should do its homework and try to develop a correct 
analysis regarding the debate of an elected versus appointed board of 
education for the New Brunswick schools. Let us first look at the two 
biggest reforms dealing with public schools and see how they relate to the 
school system here in New Brunswick.

� Brown v. Topeka Board of Education, 1954 � The United States Supreme Court 
rules against the legal form of segregation in school districts across the 
nation.

� Abott v. Burke, 1974 � The New Jersey Supreme Court rules that the 
government must ensure equal funding and the same level of quality education 
across the board for all school districts throughout the state.

As the Campaign for the Elected Board of Education studies the New Brunswick 
schools, we can see that these rulings have not materialized, and Mayor Jim 
Cahill�s administration has not been fighting for these funds and resources 
that Gov. Christie Whitman�s administration so easily withholds. It is de 
facto segregation that is cemented in the New Brunswick school district from 
top to bottom. The editorial, while noting all the merits of the Cahill 
administration, did not ask the question, �Why does Cahill send his children 
to private schools?�

African-Americans and Latinos represent over 95 percent of the enrollment at 
New Brunswick High School. How many of these children are going to be 
sitting next to you in your classes at Rutgers? Let us be clear when we 
study the merits of the Cahill administration�s appointed school board. Its 
most notable merits this year � and we should understand that it is only 
late September � include two of the biggest attacks that can take place in 
any school system. Every school district in New Jersey was mandated to 
provide a high-quality, full-day education for three-, four- and 
five-year-old children by the school year 2000-01 (New Jersey State 
Department of Education, 1998).

So, instead of restructuring space available while planning to develop 
proper facilities, the appointed school board has taken over every child 
care system throughout New Brunswick. This is after it scrapped a plan, 
because of public opposition, to put these children in trailers. None of 
these teachers are certified, which leads to the fact that none of these 
teachers can be admitted into the New Brunswick Education Association 
teachers� union. What praise does Cahill�s administration deserve for union 
busting, and does the editorial staff feel these tactics are about the 
improvement of the education system for the city�s children?

Not only does New Brunswick High School maintain the lowest standardized 
test scores in central Jersey, but the Cahill administration is also 
responsible for a graduation rate of only 55 percent. These problems were 
not something Cahill walked into; rather, they are the problems he 
engineered.

How shall we deal with such an administration? This is the question for 
people serious about improving the educational system and the overall 
improvement of the life for the people of New Brunswick and Rutgers. Not 
improvement for Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Rutgers, and 
Johnson and Johnson, but the improvement for the majority of people in this 
city who have nothing at all.

People in New Brunswick are fighting to establish Democratic community 
control over all the institutions that govern our lives. All public 
officials must be elected: police chiefs, judges, school board members, 
housing authority members. Our biggest opposition comes from the Democratic 
machine, which shows clearly whose interests it truly represents, and why we 
must run it out of town.

The Campaign for the Elected Board of Education will embrace all progressive 
forces in the spirit of unity and struggle. We endorse the People�s 
Campaign�s 17-point platform, as well as their three City Council candidates 
up for election. We are open about our intentions and clear about our 
reasons: win the elected board of education, overthrow Mayor Cahill and 
build the Revolutionary Democratic Workers Party.

Joe Smith, a University College first-year student, is campaign coordinator 
for the Campaign for the Elected Board of Education.

Subject:Letter to the editor re 10/2 editorial
Message:

October 2, 2000
To the Editor:

I'm writing regarding the editorial on 10/2/00, titled "Ideal Candidates?".  
In your piece, you said "New Brunswick's city government has a dire need for 
a change" and you also wrote that the People's Campaign "hope[s] to address 
the wants and needs of the people of New Brunswick and not the corporate 
interests that the current City Council seems to represent."  But you label 
our candidates "idealistic."

The People's Campaign has never claimed to know all the answers.  But we've 
undertaken a ten-month process to involve the entire town in its government. 
  Is it idealistic to ask people what they lack, and demand action from the 
city government?  That's what we in the local activist community have been 
doing for many years, without a word from the city council.  And now we 
propose to help the majority take its rightful position in city affairs and 
we're called "dreamers".

We challenge the Democrats for the same reasons that protestors attack the 
WTO, World Bank, and IMF.  Thousands of people in New Brunswick live in 
abject poverty, toiling day and night without hope of improving their lives. 
  None of these people get respect from anyone with power or money. They 
have to fight for their most basic needs.
The Democratic machine has organized the removal of thousands of local 
families from their housing, ignored police murders, intimidated voters and 
threatened political challengers. In short, the city council has presided 
over a city more like Soweto, South Africa than a wealthy center for 
business, technology and education.

I see two explanations for this editorial: either the Targum edit board 
doesn't leave the student center, or it seeks to serve the corporate-backed 
regime currently residing in City Hall.

Subject:Yesterday's Letter
Message:


Paul,

Let me just offer a few comments about your letter to the Targum.  I 
mean no major disrespect; but I think certain claims ought not to be 
made.  This would go to anyone seeking to defend the Campaign or 
articulate its possible virtues.  

First, you cannot rightly compare Soweto to New Brunswick.  The 
problems with New Brunswick are deeply, qualitatively different.  I 
think it's fair to say that South Africa under Apartheid, especially 
prior to the 1980's, was a Totalitarian state.  There were countless 
different 'racial' categories officially, brutally enforced by the 
state.  Mobility, the right to work in a given area, the right to
live 
in a given area, was rigidly regulated according to one's official 
place in the white / coloured / Indian / Black hierarchy.    

I should also point out that any analysis of the city of New
Brunswick 
must note that 'race' must be considered somewhat less primary to the 
city's social and political ills than class.  It's really difficult
to 
fruitfully make the case that, on the national level, South African 
society was primarily being distorted by class inequities.  

The history of South Africa can only be relativized by comparison
with 
the city of New Brunswick in such a way, therefore.  And the unique 
problems of a small American city can only be rendered less clear and 
coherent by such a distorting comparison.  So I guess I'm suggesting
to 
be awfully careful before making dramatic comparisons that are only 
very superficially valid.  

Also, while I'm at it, accusing the Targum of conspiring with the 
Democratic Party might not be the best idea, even if it's really not 
meant literally.  If there is a kind of seige mentality on the part
of 
the editorial board, saying things to reinforce it will probably do
no 
particular good.  If there are two or three sympathetic individuals
out 
of five or six people on the board, those people will probably feel
far 
less justified in standing up for the campaign if they and their 
colleagues are accused of being someone else's pawns.  Convince me 
otherwise, of course, but I think there's a good deal of truth to
this.

TTYL,

Jeremy

A myriad of responses is a great strategy to have all letters printed. 
Redundancy will give the editors an excuse not to print. Like Matt, I think 
Jeremy has a point and he should send a letter unequivically pro-People's 
Campaign. Discerning readers will appreciate the two, different responses 
(Paulie compared to Jeremy).

Does anyone have the time to go down to Trenton and pick up voter reg forms.  This is the last weekend to register to vote.  The County office is giving out photocopied forms, which cannot be mailed in, which means that fewer can be distributed since we have to wait to get them ourselves!

I should've simply stated that one ought not to relativize Apartheid.

Parents are currently clamoring for transport after school and b/w the  Health Sciences Tech HS and the HS (the Health Sciences HS has limited after-school opportunities).  The BOE claims a crisis in bus drivers is the problem, although in August they werent planning to transport students from the Health Sciences Tech HS to the HS.  Also, when it was suggested that they solve the bus driver situation by advertising to local residents via the schools, which would permit better access to better-paying jobs, Larkin stated (in the Sept BOE meeting) that he didnt want NB residents who currently are not aware of these opportunities as bus drivers of our children.

The school district has also been found not helpful in informing parents of their rights to Middlesex County transportation for disabled or injured students.

Not only that but the City administration is receiving state/federal funds for public transportation and they are planning to use it to fund buses for Rutgers students and for commuters, a targeted approach to using federal funds that could likely be the target of a class-action suit (in addition to all the others we could do if there were enough pro-bono lawyers to go around).

Hello.

I am unsubscribing myself to this listserve, and want everyone to know it
not because I think you'll miss me but because its your responsibility to
know.  Its you responsibility because your ridiculous and unprogressive
bickering has given me a tainted view of the People's Campaign that I
desparatly want to have faith in.  And I also know that I'm not the only
one who feels this way.  The Targum noted that you are all idealistic and
this makes you unfit to run a political position.  I disagree
wholeheartedly with that statement.  However, I'm beginning to think that
perhaps those BEHIND  the people running for the 3 positions are just not
mature enough to run part of the city government.  I'm not sure if you
realize that all this pettiness--which it often has come to be--is
disheartening because the PCC has put SO MUCH EFFORT into being taken
seriously by the people...and its THIS "forum" that is ruining the idea
for people like me.  I can look at your newsletter and feel like, "now
this is something I want to see happen, something I want to support."  But
having been on this listserve completely contradicts those feelings.  I am
sure you all still have my vote, but know that some people might be more
discouraged than myself and not take you seriously from all this petty
bickering and unecessary/unapplicable bullcrap contained in the 20
something waste of letters I get a day. (The amount which could greatly be
reduced if you would start replying to one another, instead of to the
entire list, over things that concern no one but the 2 parties involved.)

And I say all this to hopefully open your eyes to the perspective from a
student community memeber, not to bash you or the way you handle your
personal politics because you take care of that well enough on your own.

I would like to think I'm standing in solidarity with you (and now,
someone please take the time to ask me & the entire listserve if I know
what that means), and that you will take my perspective to heart.

Best of luck to you all, I know you intentions are good but I just can't
stand all of these unpertinent, discouraging  messages anymore.

Thanks,

Kathleen Kuehn

Subject:Re: [nbpc] Yesterday's Letter
Message:

Wow!  Kathleen, I hope that you're not turned off to independent politics in 
general. In response, I have to point out that several particulars exist on 
the egroup that don't represent the campaign as a whole.

First, most of the work of the campaign does not take place on it. The work 
takes place in face-to-face contact with people, winning them over to our 
move towards democracy.

Second, most people associated with the campaign don't check out the egroup. 
They either don't have access to the internet or they don't care.

Third, the egroups have long been a stomping ground for some people who 
don't do much work, some people who wish to advocate sloth as a political 
line, and yet other people whose online behavior differs drastically from 
their in-person behavior (they have internet muscles).

I hope you'll reconsider your doubt in the PC and please give me a call 
anytime @729-0873 and I would be glad to speak to you about any of these 
things.

Paul McGee, PC

Subject:Re: [nbpc] Yesterday's Letter
Message:

Dear Kathleen,

I am sorry to hear that you are unsubscribing from the listserve. I can only 
emphasize the fact that this egroup does not by any stretch represent the 
heart of the campaign. As Paul pointed out, most people in the Campaign 
don't have access to a computer, never mind the internet. These electronic 
discussions tend to include only those dozen or so individuals who have 
unlimited access to the net while at work, school, etc.

However, an important aspect to consider is the fact that we are a united 
front campaign. While this phrase is tossed around often enough, it's true 
meaning, I think, is really hard for me, personally, and i'm sure for 
others, to truly grasp. We are a coalition of many people with many 
DIFFERENT ideas and ways of going about things (or not, for that matter). 
Disagreement and sometimes hostility is a natural byproduct of the often 
complicated process of united action.

I have chosen to disregard entirely those people whose only contribution to 
this Campaign has been to send out nasty, demoralizing, and less than subtle 
insults about the Campaign, the platform, the candidates, the organizers, 
participating organizations, etc. I agree, it gets tiring to read these 
tirades, especially when none of the main critics will be found at a general 
Campaign meeting on the last Saturday of the month.

However, for EVERYONE ELSE this listserve has been beneficial in that it is 
a wonderful opportunity to share ideas, commendation, stories, and even 
criticism. Criticism is a healthy thing, I believe, so long as it is 
conducted with respect and positivity.

And so, again, I'm sorry to have you go. However, please don't take this to 
heart. It's true that none of us have run City government before (!), but I 
am confident that the spirit and passion that drives this Campaign (as we 
fight against every obstacle imaginable) will be a guiding force in driving 
New Brunswick forward.

In Unity,
Kristina Bas, Treasurer

Hey All Ladies,

Funky Ladies' Night was supposed to be at 218 townsend tonight.  But,
I'm very sorry, we cannot have it at 218.  If we'd like to reschedule
(which I personally would, since no one really knew about tonight, and
I have the LSAT's tomorrow;)  cool.  Otherwise, we must find another
venue.  Sorry about the last minute/inconvenience.  It's just we've had
craziness at our house every weekend for the last month and a half, and
when I talked with my roommates we all felt we needed a weekend off. 
I'll be happy to make calls or whatever is necessary when I get home
from work.  But someone needs to make a decision as to what is
happening. Again, I'm sorry, Gals.  

Julie

Message:

Dear Mr Hernandez, et al:   I fowarded the edited article and note to the 
legal staff, as I said, to avoid last minute surprises, not to ask it to be 
edited again by any other than the Vector staff.  I am frankly growing weary 
of this excercise.  I am struggling to discern genuine attempts to "make 
better journalists" and efforts to stifle my column.  This is now going into 
the third week of defending my writing, and it is extraordinarily 
disconcerting.  I have said it again and again:  the information is correct, 
etc.  I can't imagine any other article for the Vector that has gotten this 
sort of treatment.  I really don't want to take this any further.  I am 
asking once and for all that the article be printed next week, reflecting 
the careful edits that I have already made to comply with your requests.

Please dont forget to highlight the elected school board in these endeavors.

THIS IS CRITICAL AND INTEGRAL TO THE MACHINES HOLD ON THIS TOWN.  I FIND OUT MORE EVERY DAY AND WE MUST FIGHT STRONGLY TO HAVE THE BALLOT Q PASSED.

The city is spreading lies that an elected board will raise taxes.  The district themselves and the NJ School Board Assn has confirmed with me that it cannot.  School tax rates are solely dependent upon the city assessment value, since the tax levy is fixed for an Abbott v Burke district.

The city says that an elected school board will bring patronage.  We already have it.  The mayor appoints people who already have jobs with the city, who wont speak up to the Mayor and who cover for administrators; Larkin and Latimer appoint their friends to administration positions; council people are allowed to override hiring processes internal to the district, and principals chosen by these false hiring processes can determine who sits on the school management teams that are now to control the schools.

And corruption?  I know of people who will get fired if they told of the moneys that have been absorbed by administrators.

The worst is that there is a gag on all those who know anything.  They know whats going on b/c they are involved, and if they tell they wont be able to be involved any more, or they will be fired. Kudos to the parents who have gotten involved despite all and are willing to speak up and be heard, and to those leaders and teachers who are supporting us in secret. We have had a long hard road to walk together.

The mayor is holding private meetings at private schools like St. Mary's with his executive staff present (including the planning director Glen Paterson) to promote the appointed board to possibly interested parrents and to actively oppose the initiative.  If you were to go to one of these meetings, having been invited by another parent, it is likely that after 2 minutes you would be asked to leave and escorted out the door with a threat by an individual who refused to identify himself, as happened to me. The  parents who support us cant even let us come speak at a PTA meeting.

Finally, those who work for the city and in the BOE must either keep mum and/or participate actively for the machine.  I have spoken to people who support us but cannot come out because of their jobs, even if they work in the kitchen.

Anyone who needs or wants details come speak to me in person.

AND

SPREAD THE WORD!!

                                     October 12, 2000, Thursday 
HEADLINE: New Jersey Bill Targets Illegitimate Employment Agencies 

BYLINE: By Steve Chambers 


    When the Puerto Rican Congress opened a nonprofit temp agency 18 months 
ago in Lakewood, it planned to offer a "living wage" for working-class 
clients and eventually get them into full-time jobs. 

But in recent months, the organization has run into competition from out of 
the state, as vanloads of Cambodian immigrants are ferried into Monmouth and 
Ocean counties from Philadelphia, where wages hover just around the legal 
minimum. 

"We lost a chance to place 15 workers recently because the employer told us 
to negotiate our prices lower," said Lydia Valencia, executive director of 
PRC Temps. "But we pay taxes, we provide workmen's compensation, the whole 
nine yards." 

Legitimate temp agencies and unions around the state have long complained 
that they face unfair competition from unscrupulous labor providers that pay 
exploitive wages and fail to withhold taxes. 

Legislation being introduced today in Trenton attempts to crack down on this 
shadowy underground that some experts say may keep 200,000 workers off the 
books. 

The legislation, sponsored by Assembly Labor Committee Chairman George Geist 
(R-Gloucester), would spread the responsibility for withholding payroll taxes 
to the companies contracting with temp agencies. It also would strengthen the 
licensing laws, making it difficult for temp agencies to work in New Jersey 
without seeking the proper approvals. 

Observers said they are pleased that the state has finally taken action 
against what they term an explosive underground economy, but some remain wary 
of the state's ability to back up legislation with strict enforcement. 

"This sounds like a good first step," said Lee Seglem of the State Commission 
of Investigation. "It's a tough and intractable problem, with social aspects 
and economic aspects but also fairness aspects. We are most concerned about 
how widespread this rip-off of tax money is that is being siphoned out of the 
public stream." 

An exhaustive study three years ago by the SCI found rampant violations of 
the withholdings laws in several southern New Jersey food processing plants. 
Investigators determined that temp agencies, mostly from Philadelphia, were 
ferrying in hundreds of employees in vans and pocketing millions of dollars. 

Barrie Peterson, associate director of Seton Hall University's Institute on 
Work, said the state has done little to police this burgeoning industry of 
largely immigrant workers, who he said are often exploited. At the same time, 
the rise of informal temp agencies has led to a huge increase in the number 
of commuter vans on the highways, vehicles that police say are often unsafe. 

"I'm encouraged that they are finally looking at this," Peterson said. 
"Hopefully it's a first step at righting some of the injustices out there and 
protecting the public interest." 

Geist acknowledged that the legislation may face opposition from employers 
who profit handsomely from the cheap labor and also are able to keep consumer 
prices low. 

"I recognize we are rocking the boat," he said. "Now that the legislation is 
being introduced, we shall see what we shall see." 

Responding to concerns by some southern New Jersey temp agencies that the 
legislation could amount to empty promises, Geist pledged to make sure the 
necessary enforcement dollars are sought and approved. 

The bill would require the state Division of Consumer Affairs to pursue cases 
against temp agencies that fail to win licenses and pull the licenses of 
companies that don't withhold proper taxes.

hey everyone:

i found this quote on the front page of the New Jersey Election Law 
Enforcement Commission's web site. Despite the irony, it sure is applicable 
to our situation....

"And a people who mean to be their own governors, must arm themselves with 
the power that knowledge brings."

Kris,

While I'm taking a little break here ... The following publications 
strike me as maybe appropriate:

There's In These Times and the Progressive, maybe Mother Jones.  All 
three are somewhat Nation-like, but a little more populist,
especially 
The Progressive.  Mother Jones is very into corporate expose type 
pieces.  And there's always Z Magazine, which is a little more 
centered on a few personalities (Edward Said and Noam Chomsky), but 
pretty activist-minded, as you might be aware.  There's also The 
Village Voice.  I'm uncertain what the deal is with UNITE, but I'll 
bet they have some sort of monthly newsletter or magazine, as do many 
unions.  There is also Salon magazine, which is perhaps a little too 
mainstream, but worth a quick solicitation.  Maybe the Green Party
has 
a newletter or magazine-sized publication of its own?  igc.net or 
igc.com or igc.org, one of those, is a good resource if you're
looking 
for publications to contact.   

This is just a suggestion, but you might want to add some ideas into 
the letter as to what broader, New Jersey-wide or nationally relevant 
issues or movements the Campaign is relevant to, or illustrative of.  
For example, someone writing a piece on school funding, school
reform, 
or public education in New Jersey (given our now fairly famous state 
supreme court decision on funding) could easily look to the push for 
an Elected School Board.  Or, it's not difficult to imagine someone 
writing an article on Johnson and Johnson, or perhaps discussing 
Johnson and Johnson from a 'corporate welfare' angle.  You get the 
idea.  And, of course, with the Nader campaign, there's lots of
people 
writing articles on anything that goes by the name of 'independent 
grassroots politics'.  (That's probably how the language in your 
letter about 'a movement for real democracy / people's democracy'
will 
be interpreted, in any case, by most people who read it)     

TTYL,

Jeremy

OK, Paul - 

The Oct 2000 City glossy newsletter has just been distributed promoting our school system.  This means City money is being used against the elected school board question.  The mayor is boasting about the groundbreaking at Lord Stirling (15 yrs in the making) and the high school test scores.  One teacher pointed out to me that getting decent grades on the high school tests is easy - by 11th grade, many kids have dropped out, gone into special ed programs, and gone off to vocational schools.  Looking at the 8th grade test scores may give us a better picture of how our school system is doing.  In fact, none of the 8th grade valedictorians or salutatorians got a passing grade on the 8th grade standardized reading tests!

hello, this is a request for assistance from anyone who has a FAST 
computer...

on the web site, www.elec.state.nj.us you will find links that allow you to 
view single and joint candidate committee reports from the various elections 
throughout the state of new jersey. these are the campaign finance reports 
that list the where, who, and how much behind campaign contributions.

i have been trying to download the 28-day preelection reports for the 
Recine, Schrum, and Cook joint candidate committee for the upcoming general 
election. this report was filed last week. however, in order to view the 
reports, you must download a convoluted array of strange programs. I don't 
have a fast enough computer (dial-up, blah!) to download these programs (6K 
in size), so i haven't been able to access the reports.

If i order the reports via the ELEC office, it will cost money.

so, i'm putting out the call for anyone with a DSL or cable modem to try to 
get these reports for me. it shouldn't take too much time. Instructions for 
the download are located on www.elec.state.nj.us/download.htm

can anyone help?? getting this report would be very useful to us....

please let me know,

thanks much,
Kristina
(harried campaign treasurer)

Hi,

If you look at today's Targum, there's an article about the RCGA 
discussing whether to host a city council debate; there were some odd 
remarks about how having the People's Campaign participate would
raise 
security concerns about having a "rowdy audience".  Struck me as a 
very odd remark, not so subtle coded bias against _something_. I
think 
the article said, however, that it was ultimately resolved to host 
such a debate.  But it also said that the person on the RCGA who was 
worried about 'security issues' had spoken to the Democrats, and they 
had told him that they would never debate the People's Campaign.

I don't remember it with perfect clarity; it should prove an 
interesting read to anyone concerned:

From Today's New Jersey Star-Ledger

New Brunswick incumbents reject debate

10/20/00

BY ALEXANDER LANE
STAFF WRITER

The three New Brunswick Democratic councilmen up for re-election yesterday 
backed out of an Oct. 30 debate against three independents running as the 
People's Campaign.


The Rutgers College Governing Association, a nonpartisan group of Rutgers 
student leaders, organized the debate. But talks with the Democrats fell 
apart when they unilaterally declined the invitation, said Alex Goldmark of 
the association.


People's Campaign candidate Keith Joseph, who is running on a slate for city 
council with Curtis Warren and Diego Morales, criticized the Democrats' 
decision.


"It's really a stifling of the discussion," Joseph said. "A debate 
encourages discussion of different ideas in the city. Right now you have one 
voice in power, the Democrats."


Two of the incumbent Democratic candidates, Joseph Schrum and Robert Recine, 
have not returned phone calls to explain why they would not debate.


The third, Jimmie Cook, said he did not know the invitation had been turned 
down since their campaign manager, assistant city attorney T.K. Shamy, is 
handling such matters.


"I think that the candidates' records speak for themselves. I don't think 
there's any profit to a debate from the public's perspective," Shamy said.


With a major money advantage, the Democrats may have decided they do not 
need to debate. As of Oct. 10 they raised $25,900, mainly in contributions 
over $300. By contrast, the People's Campaign has raised just $8,959, mainly 
in contributions of less than $300.


Rhodia Inc., the French chemical company fending off a lawsuit for its 
alleged pollution of a Raritan River tributary, contributed $400 to the 
Democrats. The New Jersey Carpenters political committee gave them $1,000, 
as did David Samuel, an engineer with CME Associates, and Matrix Realty, a 
group planning an office complex on George Street. The Wilentz, Goldman & 
Spitzer law firm gave them $800.


People's Campaign organizers said they were fighting the financial 
disadvantage with legwork. For example, they deliver all of their literature 
by hand, not through the mail.


"When we raise money it's a heart and soul kind of thing," said Kristina 
Bas, the People's Campaign treasurer. "The truth of the matter is you can't 
buy popular support."


But the disadvantage is even more daunting than it appears. The New 
Brunswick Democratic Committee has $10,109 on hand with which it can help 
the candidates, according to the committee's most recent report. The annual 
Democratic dinner/dance takes place at the New Brunswick Hyatt Regency on 
Sunday, and another fund-raiser is scheduled at the Elks Lodge next 
Thursday.


And the People's Campaign is trying to wage two campaigns with their modest 
coffers -- they are fighting to switch the city board of education from a 
body appointed by the mayor to one elected by residents.


A Democrat-linked group -- the Committee to Keep Politics Out of Our Schools 
-- has raised $9,540 to keep a mayoral-appointed school board. All of that 
money has come in contributions under $300.


By law, contributions less than $300 do not have to be itemized, so small 
contributors can remain anonymous.


Joseph said that is a selling point for People's Campaign contributors -- 
such as local small businesses -- who do not wish to be on the record 
opposing the party in power.


"If they donate less than $300 they can remain anonymous and not face 
retaliation," Joseph said.


Glen Fleming, who is running as an independent and calling his campaign 
Reform Our City, did not report having raised any money on his most recent 
campaign-finance reports, but he said since those were filed he has raised 
up to $1,000.

           Dems accused of evading debate

           Published in the Home News Tribune 10/23/00

           By RON GEORGE
           STAFF WRITER

           NEW BRUNSWICK: Hoping to stir Democrats into meeting for a 
debate, members of the People's Campaign
           protested at last night's Democratic fund-raiser at the Hyatt 
Regency New Brunswick hotel with a man dressed in a
           chicken costume.

           People's Campaign candidates Curtis L. Warren and Keith Joseph, 
along with Frank Bright, the chairman of the New
           Brunswick Republican Party -- wearing an oversized chicken 
costume, making clucking noises and flapping his "wings"
           -- and about a dozen children paraded along the Neilson Street 
entrance carrying signs asking Democrats what they
           had to hide.

           Protesters were in full view of attendees of the event as they 
drove into the hotel's parking deck.

           Joseph, Warren and Diego Morales constitute the ticket of the 
grass-roots organization that will challenge Democrats
           Jimmie Cook, Jr., Robert Recine and Joseph Schrum in next month's 
elections. No Republican has entered the race.
           Glen J. Fleming is running for office under the Reform Our City 
party.

           "There is no debate in New Brunswick," said Joseph. "They are 
trying to escape democracy. They are trying to skirt
           the issues. The Democrats said they are running on their record 
and that it speaks for itself. Well, it doesn't speak for
           the majority of New Brunswick residents."

           Joseph said the Democrats, who control city government, are 
"chickening out" of debating the upstart organization.

           But Schrum said there was no formal agreement or ground rules 
set. He dismissed the oppositions claim the debates
           were not held because the People's camp was not a recognized 
party.

           Schrum said in the past, New Brunswick debates have included 
third and independent party candidates.

           The Rutgers College Governing Association, a nonpartisan group of 
Rutgers student leaders, had scheduled a debate
           for Oct. 30, but talks with the Democrats fell apart.

           Schrum reiterated the Democrats position of running on their 
records and would not comment on the protest that was
           being waged outside.

           He didn't acknowledge protesters who, using a bull-horn, shouted 
at him to engage in a debate as he walked into the
           hotel.

           "I'll tell you what they are afraid of," said Warren. "They don't 
want to answer what happened to the $3.5 million from
           the school budget, they don't want to answer about housing and 
jobs and the ethnic cleansing that is going on under the
           guise of redevelopment."

           The People's Campaign candidates don't have all the answers, but 
we are willing to stand before the people and
           answer questions," Warren added.

           A state Local Government Budget Review of the 1997 school budget 
revealed areas where the district could have
           $3.5 million in savings.

           The People's Party is also campaigning to switch the city board 
of education from a body appointed by the mayor to
           one elected by residents.

           Ron George: (732) 246-5500, Ext. 7347.

Subject:VOTER INFO - ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD Q - FORWARD TO ALL LISTS
Message:

Please pass this info on the elected school board question on to all 
possible lists.
It is based on a compilation of parents and teachers comments.

Why we should vote YES! for an Elected School Board
Commitee for an Elected School Board
New Brunswick Peoples Campaign

Vote Yes and Stop High Taxes
Only City Hall can currently raise taxes for the Board of Education (and it 
has this year).  Our locally-paid school budget is fixed at $25 million 
because New Brunswick is an Abbott School District (Abbott v. Burke).  
Therefore, the amount of taxes we must raise locally depends on our property 
assessments - something only City Hall can influence, yet under the current 
appointed system, the school board cannot comment on or critique City Hall's 
approach - because the board of education is elected.
Under the current appointed board only the Board of Estimate increases or 
decreases the budget.  Any budget increase has been the sole responsibility 
of the Mayor, 2 city council people, and 2 mayor-appointed school board 
members (who make up the Board of Estimate).  With an elected Board of 
Education there will be no budget increase without voter approval.

Vote Yes and Stop Patronage
The hiring of principals is completely under the control of City Hall.  They 
have been allowed to override the Board of Education's own search 
committees' recommendations and hired less than competent appointees.  This 
has caused 'teacher flight' and compromised the integrity of our education 
system.
Without fear of repercussions or public accountability, the superintendent 
has forced schools to pay for and implement his educational programs.  Not 
surprisingly, these programs, like the Sequoyah Literacy Program (a computer 
based literacy program) have been rumored to sold to the district by a 
friend of the superintendent himself.

Vote Yes and Stop Corruption
Under the current system, school money has been poorly allocated or even 
absorbed by administrators in areas including the theatrical arts, federal 
parent training programs, and technology labs.  Meanwhile, New Brunswick 
parents are vastly underrepresented in national training conferences, and 
our students receive fewer opportunities.  The state of New Jersey also 
estimated that $3.5M was wasted in the local school budget.  They went 
further to state City Hall wrongly used $1M of district money for City 
purposes, not the school district!

Vote Yes and Keep City Hall Politics out of our Schools
New Brunswick Board of Education is not independent of City Hall.  That is 
why the superintendent and the Board of Education cannot comment publicly on 
mayoral policies that affect the school district.  Such policies include 
taxes, facilities development, transportation, and youth recreation.
Everyone's scared to talk.  Board of Education employees by the dozen have 
all voiced serious concerns about the Board's competency to run the 
district.  However, no one is willing to go on record, stating fear of 
reprisals by administrators.  Teachers were even instructed to not publicly 
speak about the issue in faculty meetings.  Parents won't talk because they 
face exclusion from leadership committees, and the stigmatizing and denial 
of services to their children.

Vote Yes and Get Accountability and Respect
583 out of the 602 school districts in New Jersey are under the direct 
control of the people of that district.  New Brunswick is one of the 19 in 
which politicians control who is on the Board of Education, where and how 
the money is spent, and how much taxes should be collected.
The Board of Education meetings are not accessible to concerned residents.  
The real decisions are made prior to the public meeting in closed session 
that often runs well past the time working parents are capable of 
participating.  Then they repeatedly disregard the input of parents, 
teachers, and residents during the supposed public session.  Key concerns 
are often resolved privately after the meeting, which discourages open 
public debate.

Vote Yes and Regain Control of the Quality of Public Education
The Mayor has used our school district continually as a promotional vehicle 
for the redevelopment of New Brunswick while he has undermined the integrity 
of our school system.  The plain truth is only 46% of our students graduate 
from High School, only 37% take the SAT's, there is no Middle School, and in 
March of 2000 no 8th grade valedictorians passed the Standardized 8th grade 
reading and language arts test (the G.E.P.A,).  The district supports the 
hiring of private, non-union staff for the Health Sciences Technology High 
School and Early Childhood Program through a private company known for its 
high staff turnover rates in New Brunswick.

Points to ponder:

1. Dr Larkin addressing parents, June BOE mtg:  If you dont like the 
education system in New Brunswick, send your kids somewhere else!

2. Mayor Chahill has organized private, invitation-only meetings with  his 
top staff (city planner, fire chief) to oppose the measure, HOSTED by a 
PRIVATE SCHOOL, St Mary's!

3. The Mayors attorney has argued against clarifying the ballot question 
because it would be too clear, and people would not be forced to read the 
interpretive statement.

4. The elected school board is endorsed by the New Jersey Education 
Association and the Home News Tribune.

5. Parents and teachers who know of abuses within the system are afraid to 
go public, since it would place their jobs at stake, or they would be 
excluded from leadership positions in the schools, or they are afraid their 
children would receive poorer services (YES!)

for the redevelopment of New Brunswick while he has undermined the integrity 
of our school system.  The plain truth is only 46% of our students graduate 
from High School, only 37% take the SAT's, there is no Middle School, and in 
March of 2000 no 8th grade valedictorians passed the Standardized 8th grade 
reading and language arts test (the G.E.P.A,).  The district supports the 
hiring of private, non-union staff for the Health Sciences Technology High 
School and Early Childhood Program through a private company known for its 
high staff turnover rates in New Brunswick.

Additional questions to ask yourself and food for thought:

1.  What does it mean when the Superintendent can say to concerned parents 
at a board of ed meeting:
"If you don't like the school system in New Brunswick, send your kids 
somewhere else!"

2.  What does it mean when the Mayor organizes private invitation including 
his top administrative staff such as the City Planner and Fire Chief, only 
meetings to promote the local school system HOSTED AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL, St. 
Mary's?

3.  What does it mean when the City's attorney argues in court against 
rewording the ballot question by saying it would make it so clear, readers 
would no longer be forced to look at the interpretive statement to 
understand the question?

4.  What does it mean when this info has been gathered from a network of 
anonymous parents and teacher leaders, who are afraid of the repercussions 
on their jobs and positions when the mayor-appointed administration finds 
out they support this initiative?

YES! for an elected board of education is endorsed by the New Jersey 
Education Association and the main local newspaper, the Home News Tribune.

Subject:Election day question.
Message:

Hey all,
    An acquaintance of mine in local government mentioned to me that most 
fraudulent voting is done via absentee ballot.  A recommendation was to have 
someone check the list of death certificates in New Brunswick over the last 4 
years to the absentee ballots to make sure this isn't happening.  Is someone 
already looking into this?  Thought I would pass the information along.
Jim

Zofia, This is great writing with new and important facts, but there is one 
small point that I think needs clarification for those not familiar with the 
issue.

In the third sentence, you say the board can't comment on the cause of tax 
increases because it's 'elected', instead of 'appointed'. I'm sending this 
to the list because I don't know how far and wide it's been spread. I think 
it's worth clarifying. Paul

Subject:TALK UP $25MM FACTS AND SHORT COUNCIL MEETINGS!!
Message:

FYI, I got the updated version but then received another copy of the first, 
this time with the subject in all caps.

EVERYBODY--THIS AGITATION WORKS! WE'RE GETTING STRONG RESPONSES FROM MILDLY 
INTERESTED PEOPLE OVER THE THREE AND SEVEN MINUTE CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS!!

Overall, though, really good info, I used the 25mm cap point at almost every 
door i knocked on last night and got a great response. I also would like 
more details on that-is there an original document put out by the city 
explaining that, or something. The other point that's been working really 
well with people is the debate rejection along with telling people how long 
(short) the last two city council meetings have been. I say '3 and 7 
minutes, respectively', and people get mad. It works.  Keep up the 
circulation of ideas and info.  CHARGE TO VICTORY!!!!!

ANYONE WHO CAN CANVASS FOR ONE,TWO,THREE HOURS ON ANY DAY B4 EDAY-CALL THE 
OFFICE. WE'RE GOING OUT EVERY DAY AND WE'RE KICKING ASS.

PEOPLE ARE BUGGING OUT IN ANTICIPATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THIS CITY. 
PEOPLE WANT MEETINGS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. THEY WANT ACTION THEY WANT 
CHANGE. WE'RE MAKING IT HAPPEN. SEE YOU ON THE STREET! PAUL

Message:

OK, the 2 sources on the cap info are - Mr. Jannerone (sp?) of NB Public Schools and Bob Albert of the NJ School Board Association (who knows a bunch re Abbott districts) confirmed this statement, and I questioned it 2 x with each of them, restating it over again.  Neither when asked whether and how the cap would change thought that it would, although this might be a q for someone who has the time to take it beyond these folks to Mr. Hespe at the State level.

more details on that-is there an original document put out by the city 
explaining that, or something. The other point that's been working really 
well with people is the debate rejection along with telling people how long 
(short) the last two city council meetings have been. I say '3 and 7 
minutes, respectively', and people get mad. It works.  Keep up the 
circulation of ideas and info.  CHARGE TO VICTORY!!!!!

ANYONE WHO CAN CANVASS FOR ONE,TWO,THREE HOURS ON ANY DAY B4 EDAY-CALL THE 
OFFICE. WE'RE GOING OUT EVERY DAY AND WE'RE KICKING ASS.

PEOPLE ARE BUGGING OUT IN ANTICIPATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THIS CITY. 
PEOPLE WANT MEETINGS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. THEY WANT ACTION THEY WANT 
CHANGE. WE'RE MAKING IT HAPPEN. SEE YOU ON THE STREET! PAUL

Subject:School Board Taxes
Message:

OK, Paul, Thanks to your questions, I have more info for you from a third 
source, Joan Ponessa, Director of Research, Education Law Center, Newark, 
NJ.

This last year, our school district tax rate increased because the property 
tax values went down (NB School District source).  However, Joan states 
there are other factors that influence our school district tax rate - 
particularly, how much money the state gives us.  If when we apply to the 
state for supplemental funding, they dont give it to us, or if they don't 
give us enough Early Childhood Aid, our local levy can increase, too.

Joan states that research has shown whether a board is appointed or elected 
does not influence one way or another what the local tax rate is.  She 
stated that in her opinion the major thing that changes is the relationship 
between the school board and City Hall.  So the opposition is dead wrong 
with the first of their major slogans.

The opposition also points to the cost of running elections, citing a 
$10,000 cost of running them.  What is that compared to the dollars wasted 
currently in a $100M+ school budget?

They also state there is low voter turnout in such elections.  This is 
something our grassroots effort must ensure against.

The consensus of NJ SBA and Ms. Ponessa is that whether a board should be 
appointed or elected depends on each specific local case.

Subject:People Campaign for City Council, New Brunswick, NJ
Message:

To the Courageous Staff at Democracy Now,

Please keep a close eye on the in New Brunswick, NJ.  This is a broad, 
multi-national united front of democratic classes focused on one goal: 
seizing political power from a hopelessly corrupted, though deeply 
entrenched, corporate City Machine represented by one party...in this case, 
the Democrats.  Through a months long process of canvassing over 1000 city 
residents last spring, the People's Campaign drew up a real democratic 
platform that was voted on at a Public Convention last April, where Amiri 
Baraka gave the opening address.  Now this campaign, which was initiated by 
the revolutionary democratic New Jersey Freedom Organization (NJFO), has 
picked up unprecidented momentum and, quite literally, has been turning New 
Brunswick upside-down.  At the convention, we also elected a ticket of three 
community members from a pool of eight nominations:  Diego Morales, a 
Mexican-Ameirican who once organized unions in Mexico; Curtis Warren, an 
African American bus driver who for years has fought for justice for victims 
of police brutality in New Brunswick, in particular, Sissy Adams who was 
murdered by former Officer James Consalvo back in Sept of 1996 (covered by 
WBAI's Wake Up Morning Show and Evening News); and Keith Joseph, a Rutgers 
graduate of Philosophy and a house painter, and a senior member of NJFO.  
For months, we have been blanketing the city and campus with our literature, 
informing people of the issues that matter most to them, continuing our door 
to door canvass, and generally making the City Machine feel the heat of the 
people taken to the street!  Most recently, the Machine's incumbent 
candidates have backed out of a debate that was being organized by the Home 
News & Tribune, as their track record of lies, corruption and scandals leave 
them with more to lose than to gain by such public exposure as a debate 
would bring. (Covered by the Star Ledger and the Home News & Tribune) Like 
the Imperialist candidates at the national level, they have shown that they 
are not interested in democracy, or in hearing the cries of the people...so 
like the national pawns of International Finance Capital, THEY GOT TO GO!!!

All Power to the People!

In Unity & Struggle, Matthew Smith

(LONG LIVE DEMOCRACY NOW...Down with the undemocratic Pacifica Board!)

From the Newark Star Ledger:

                Jury decides against policeman

                10/27/00

                STAFF WRITER

                A New Brunswick policeman gambled that he could beat charges 
that he and another officer ran a brothel in the city called the Pleasure 
Dome. Yesterday he lost the gamble, and now the two officers are facing 10 
years in prison.
                After six hours of deliberation, a jury in Middlesex County 
convicted Detective James Marshall and Sgt. Marco Chinchilla, along with 
three others, on charges of operating a bordello out of a seedy warehouse at 
121 Jersey Ave. in New Brunswick.
                In convicting the officers, the jury accepted the accounts 
of an admitted prostitute and her drug-addicted former boyfriend over those 
of two decorated cops, one of whom admitted he was at the warehouse but only 
to conduct a stakeout.
                The background of their two star witnesses had worried
prosecutors. Last weekend, as lawyers for both sides
prepared their closing arguments, prosecutors offered Marshall a highly 
unusual plea agreement, according to people involved in the case: In 
exchange for pleading guilty to lesser charges, Marshall would avoid prison. 
What's more, his four co-defendants would avoid prison, also.
              Convinced he would be acquitted, Marshall refused to
plead guilty. Yesterday he stood somberly in a New Brunswick courtroom as 
the jury convicted him, Chinchilla and the three others.
                "I think they made a mistake," Marshall later said of the 
jury. "The prosecutor is a liar. The witnesses lied. I still     insist I 
didn't do anything illegal and the truth will come out."
                Marshall, 44, and Chinchilla, 41, stared intently at the 
jurors as the verdict was announced. Chinchilla continued to stand for some 
minutes but bowed his head and sat down after his mother, seated in the 
first row of the gallery, started to sob.
                Marshall, Chinchilla and businessman Luis Posadas were
convicted of conspiracy, official misconduct and promoting prostitution. 
Posadas rented the third-floor warehouse space where the brothel was 
operated under the guise of a legitimate massage parlor, known as Club 121.
                Michelle Thibeault, 31, and Joyce Sweeney, 32,     masseuses 
at the brothel, were convicted of conspiracy.  Thibeault also was convicted 
of promoting prostitution, but  Sweeney was acquitted of that charge.
                Neither Chinchilla nor his family members would discuss the 
verdict. Middlesex County Prosecutor Glenn Berman said he was pleased with 
the verdict, but he added: "The conviction of two law-enforcement officers 
is not a cause for our office to celebrate. . . . I know this case has 
caused a divide with the New Brunswick Police Department. I have already 
talked to Director (Michael) Beltranena about this. We want to heal that 
rift."
                The jury of eight men and four women deliberated
Wednesday afternoon and a short time yesterday morning a brief ending to a 
trial that lasted five weeks.
                Superior Court Judge Barnett Hoffman said he will
sentence the defendants Dec. 18. They remained free on bail, although the 
judge ordered Posadas and Chinchilla, who have passports, to surrender them.
                The two police officers, both 16-year veterans, have been 
suspended without pay since they were indicted in December 1998. Beltranena 
said the suspensions would continue and additional action against the 
officers is pending. Upon sentencing, the officers face being barred from 
work in law enforcement.
                The case against Marshall and Chinchilla was closely
followed in the law-enforcement and legal communities --
not only because of the accusation against the two officers
but because of the backgrounds of the star witnesses, Katherine Saddler, 37, 
and Robert Rogers, 32.
                "Wow. I am surprised," former Bergen County Prosecutor John 
Fahy said after hearing about the verdict. "This was a
very risky case from the prosecutor's perspective. Who's going to believe a 
hooker or a junkie as compared with a police officer?"
                But Assistant Middlesex County Prosecutor Lawrence
Welle, who tried the case, said he never doubted the witnesses.  "People who 
violate the law do not do it with priests and rabbis and persons of the 
higher echelons of society,"
                Welle said. "For one reason or another, certain people tried 
to diminish how good a case it was. While the one woman was a prostitute and 
was not in the best period of her life, and they both were using drugs, the 
information they had was credible."
                Jurors were riveted, and sometimes amused, by the
testimony of Saddler and Rogers, who described a thriving house of 
prostitution that boasted a waiting room, massage tables, showers and a VIP 
room with a canopy bed.
                Prosecutors were aware that trying to convict two police 
officers, both personable and well-liked men, would be difficult. And the 
defense compounded the task by bringing in former and current employees of 
the prosecutor's office, including police and assistant prosecutors, as 
character witnesses.
                Marshall, who headed up vice investigations, testified he 
had been in the warehouse on more than a dozen occasions to stake out an 
auto theft ring operating in a backyard garage. He said he never saw any 
evidence of prostitution. On cross-examination, he acknowledged he had never 
filed any reports pertaining to his surveillance activity.
                Chinchilla, once named Officer of the Year for his
crime-fighting efforts, told the jury he never set foot in the
warehouse during the times the state's witnesses claimed
he was there.
                In the end, said juror George Levins, the panel believed 
Saddler, even as she faces criminal charges elsewhere, and Rogers. "We 
didn't believe everything she said, but she did have
some crucial evidence. So did Bobby Rogers," Levins said.
               "The prosecution did a good job and the defense did a
good job. We looked at the evidence and felt it backed up
our verdict."

                Jury decides against policeman

                10/27/00

                STAFF WRITER

                A New Brunswick policeman gambled that he could beat charges 
that he and another officer ran a brothel in the city called the Pleasure 
Dome. Yesterday he lost the gamble, and now the two officers are facing 10 
years in prison.
                After six hours of deliberation, a jury in Middlesex County 
convicted Detective James Marshall and Sgt. Marco Chinchilla, along with 
three others, on charges of operating a bordello out of a seedy warehouse at 
121 Jersey Ave. in New Brunswick.
                In convicting the officers, the jury accepted the accounts 
of an admitted prostitute and her drug-addicted former boyfriend over those 
of two decorated cops, one of whom admitted he was at the warehouse but only 
to conduct a stakeout.
                The background of their two star witnesses had worried
prosecutors. Last weekend, as lawyers for both sides
prepared their closing arguments, prosecutors offered Marshall a highly 
unusual plea agreement, according to people involved in the case: In 
exchange for pleading guilty to lesser charges, Marshall would avoid prison. 
What's more, his four co-defendants would avoid prison, also.
              Convinced he would be acquitted, Marshall refused to
plead guilty. Yesterday he stood somberly in a New Brunswick courtroom as 
the jury convicted him, Chinchilla and the three others.
                "I think they made a mistake," Marshall later said of the 
jury. "The prosecutor is a liar. The witnesses lied. I still     insist I 
didn't do anything illegal and the truth will come out."
                Marshall, 44, and Chinchilla, 41, stared intently at the 
jurors as the verdict was announced. Chinchilla continued to stand for some 
minutes but bowed his head and sat down after his mother, seated in the 
first row of the gallery, started to sob.
                Marshall, Chinchilla and businessman Luis Posadas were
convicted of conspiracy, official misconduct and promoting prostitution. 
Posadas rented the third-floor warehouse space where the brothel was 
operated under the guise of a legitimate massage parlor, known as Club 121.
                Michelle Thibeault, 31, and Joyce Sweeney, 32,     masseuses 
at the brothel, were convicted of conspiracy.  Thibeault also was convicted 
of promoting prostitution, but  Sweeney was acquitted of that charge.
                Neither Chinchilla nor his family members would discuss the 
verdict. Middlesex County Prosecutor Glenn Berman said he was pleased with 
the verdict, but he added: "The conviction of two law-enforcement officers 
is not a cause for our office to celebrate. . . . I know this case has 
caused a divide with the New Brunswick Police Department. I have already 
talked to Director (Michael) Beltranena about this. We want to heal that 
rift."
                The jury of eight men and four women deliberated
Wednesday afternoon and a short time yesterday morning a brief ending to a 
trial that lasted five weeks.
                Superior Court Judge Barnett Hoffman said he will
sentence the defendants Dec. 18. They remained free on bail, although the 
judge ordered Posadas and Chinchilla, who have passports, to surrender them.
                The two police officers, both 16-year veterans, have been 
suspended without pay since they were indicted in December 1998. Beltranena 
said the suspensions would continue and additional action against the 
officers is pending. Upon sentencing, the officers face being barred from 
work in law enforcement.
                The case against Marshall and Chinchilla was closely
followed in the law-enforcement and legal communities --
not only because of the accusation against the two officers
but because of the backgrounds of the star witnesses, Katherine Saddler, 37,

1999 Legislative Data Book, NJ - basically, of those students entering NB high schools, how many end up graduating from there.

These stats include those students who drop out of school AND those who transfer out b/c of moving or going to a different (such as private) school system.  It is a tricky number.  The board of Ed has stated the dropout rate at 10% but upon questioning it is not clear exactly what this stands for (for ex. is it for the senior class)- you might want to try again. One teacher has said that noone knows what the real dropout rate is and this needs to be better measured. Re: transfering out of the system - It is true that we have a mobile population, but I know many people who work something out w/ nieghboring districts such as East Brunswick through a relative etc.

Subject:illegitimate academic should get the boot
Message:

Check out this Gillespie character and his faulty logic. I'm copying his bs 
editorial (from today's Targum) below, after my comments.

How can this guy claim positive results when 46% of entering students 
actually graduate NBHS? This guy must be EXPOSED! We can't tolerate 
pseudo-intellectuals. This professor is well-known and regarded in American 
Studies. We need to boot such folk to the intellectual gutter, where they 
belong. We need to utilize the public spotlight and SMASH fake claims and 
shoddy logic. We need debates on these issues, we need debates on democracy, 
elections, role of intellectuals and revolutionaries, the parties, history 
of voter disenfranchisement/jim crow/apartheid in the US.----elaboration on 
the 13th-15th amendments, voter rights act, economic position of oppressed 
nationalities (minorities) and their relationship to the broader economy.  
Let's start checking these out after the election and start exposing 
apologist frauds like Gillespie. These are some of the questions I think 
stand astride of the current education crisis in Abbott districts all over 
NJ, etc.

Here are the words of a chump:

Board member asks N.B. to vote �no�



                                           By Angus Kress Gillespie
                                           Guest Commentary


                                           Lately we�ve been hearing a lot 
about an important issue facing New Brunswick
                                           voters on the Nov. 7 ballot. For 
the fourth time in eight years, New Brunswick
                                           residents are being asked to 
consider switching to an elected school board. On
                                           each of the last three occasions 
this question was posed to New Brunswick
                                           voters, it was overwhelmingly 
rejected.

                                           As an educator and a long-time 
resident of the City of New Brunswick, I would
                                           like to take a moment to tell you 
just a few reasons why I believe you should vote
                                           �no� on the Board of Education 
question.

                                           I have seen the remarkable 
renaissance of this city that, unless you�ve been here
                                           for some time, is truly hard to 
appreciate fully. Among the many achievements this
                                           city has realized over the past 
few decades, perhaps most impressive are the
                                           accomplishments of the New 
Brunswick public schools. This is a subject matter
                                           of which I can speak from 
firsthand experience because I have the honor and
                                           privilege of serving as a member 
of the New Brunswick Board of Education.

                                           Our University�s involvement with 
the New Brunswick public schools has led to
                                           many successful partnerships, 
such as internship opportunities for Rutgers
                                           students, involvement of Rutgers 
students in after-school programming in all New
                                           Brunswick schools and the 
Professional Development School with the Rutgers
                                           Graduate School of Education.

                                           I�m extremely proud of the 
progress we�ve made to provide quality education to
                                           our 6,000 students and their 
parents, such as:

gain in the state;

                                           � Now over 1,000 computers in our 
schools, with computer labs in each school,
                                           and an average of four computers 
with Internet access in every classroom;

three- and four-year-olds citywide.

                                           As a member of the Board of 
Education, I am familiar with the process that I
                                           went through to be appointed to 
the board. There are no campaigns, no campaign
                                           contributions, no special 
interest influence and no self-promotion by elected
                                           school board members at the 
expense of our children.

                                           The board is made up of people 
just like me, whose only interest is to provide our
                                           children with the best possible 
education at a cost our residents can afford. So if
                                           you�re a New Brunswick resident 
and intend to vote on this ballot question, I
                                           hope you will join me in 
rejecting the efforts of political candidates attempting to
                                           undo all of the progress we have 
made with a board that puts our children ahead
                                           of politics. On Nov. 7, please 
say �No� to politics in our schools and vote no on
                                           the Board of Education question.

                                           Angus Kress Gillespie, Ph.D., is 
a professor of American studies and a member
                                           of the New Brunswick Board of 
Education.

Subject:Bush for Pres.?
Message:

Dear Mr. Nader and Campaign Staff:

I write visceral and blunt urgings for your organization to reexamine your
role in the presidential election.

I submit the following as cause to back out of the race at this eleventh
hour:

1.  George Bush is a serial killer, a chronic privatizer, and an incoherent
babbler. Al Gore is not. The first two facts have most impact for minorities
who have never had the franchise in this country. Those minorities are not
voting Nader this year.

2.  Al Gore is inextricably tied to the Democratic Party, making him
accountable to local organizations around the country, not just finance
capital. That's what makes a party, independent local organizations. You
have to beat dems and reps in local elections to have a snowball's chance in
hell to win nationally.

3.  I think it's clear that your party will not win its five percent popular
vote to get federal funds, so why run anymore? There are no more gains to be
made for the national Green Party at this point.

4.  Lastly, I cite the example of Rudy "sans the little moustache" Ghouliani
in NYC. Rudy ran against Dinkins in '94. Many of the same "Left" groups who
support Nader for President ran massive publicity campaigns against Dinkins.
These groups mainly called Dinkins a sellout, sd he wasn't revolutionary
enough, called him a Tom, etc.  Dinkins was not a serial killer, a chronic
privatizer, an undying friend of the most reactionary sectors of finance
capital since Weimar Germany-- but Herr Giuliani is!!!  So these so-called
Left groups succeeded in knocking down Dinkins so much that fascist Giuliani
got elected.

Don't make the same mistake that these lefties made.  Make no mistake, Bush
likes fascism. Let's not confuse party-building with spoiler politics.

In Unity and Struggle for a vigorous independent political party,

Paul McGee, New Jersey Freedom Organization

Message:

I know neither one of these (the original or the response) are about the 
NBPC but...Um, Paul, are you on Crack?  Did you notice the Nader has 3-6% 
in each area?  Gore may not be this "serial killer, et al" that you called 
Bush, but he is a LIAR!  An outright, flaming, liar...he doesn't even know 
what he did and did not do -- can I just site the Internet as just ONE 
example out of many contradictions/outright lies he has told?  If the 
Republicans win, this country will drop like a rock and maybe it'll be 
easier to fight back from dead zero than to sit on the crap we have had for 
the past 8 years in the White House.

To quote a funny post I got somewhere else that's very fitting:

LEHRER: It's time for closing statements.

GORE: I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will
fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning the White
House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me.

BUSH: It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one
but Republicans.

Paul you are wrong with the whole Giuliani incident anyway.  You do not 
live in New York and never have.  Why don't you ask Jessica Want about 
Dinkins/Giuliani election year and find out what *really* went down.

I just heard about this on the radio and I think its great!  Learn how to do 
both:  support a Gore presidency and assist the Green Party to garner 5% of 
the vote so that they can obtain federal funds for the 2004 election!

Message:

Paul, you are such an aspiring demagogue.  You use one statistic to go off
on a derisive rant, completely ignoring one simple fact stemming from that
statistic -- people have the right to drop out of school when they hit
sixteen years.  For those teens for whom life on the streets seems a faster
way to make a buck -- I was one of them in my day, I dropped out for much
the same reasons -- the school system is not to blame.  The educators can
only do so much.

Next time, let's have one sentence of rhetoric and the rest of the paragraph
be informative.  You could take some lessons from Doctor Gillespie.

Check out this Gillespie character and his faulty logic. I'm copying his bs
editorial (from today's Targum) below, after my comments.

How can this guy claim positive results when 46% of entering students
actually graduate NBHS? This guy must be EXPOSED! We can't tolerate
pseudo-intellectuals. This professor is well-known and regarded in American
Studies. We need to boot such folk to the intellectual gutter, where they
belong. We need to utilize the public spotlight and SMASH fake claims and
shoddy logic. We need debates on these issues, we need debates on democracy,
elections, role of intellectuals and revolutionaries, the parties, history
of voter disenfranchisement/jim crow/apartheid in the US.----elaboration on
the 13th-15th amendments, voter rights act, economic position of oppressed
nationalities (minorities) and their relationship to the broader economy.
Let's start checking these out after the election and start exposing
apologist frauds like Gillespie. These are some of the questions I think
stand astride of the current education crisis in Abbott districts all over
NJ, etc.

Here are the words of a chump:

Board member asks N.B. to vote �no�



                                           By Angus Kress Gillespie
                                           Guest Commentary


                                           Lately we�ve been hearing a lot
about an important issue facing New Brunswick
                                           voters on the Nov. 7 ballot. For
the fourth time in eight years, New Brunswick
                                           residents are being asked to
consider switching to an elected school board. On
                                           each of the last three occasions
this question was posed to New Brunswick
                                           voters, it was overwhelmingly
rejected.

                                           As an educator and a long-time
resident of the City of New Brunswick, I would
                                           like to take a moment to tell you
just a few reasons why I believe you should vote
                                           �no� on the Board of Education
question.

                                           I have seen the remarkable
renaissance of this city that, unless you�ve been here
                                           for some time, is truly hard to
appreciate fully. Among the many achievements this
                                           city has realized over the past
few decades, perhaps most impressive are the
                                           accomplishments of the New
Brunswick public schools. This is a subject matter
                                           of which I can speak from
firsthand experience because I have the honor and
                                           privilege of serving as a member
of the New Brunswick Board of Education.

                                           Our University�s involvement with
the New Brunswick public schools has led to
                                           many successful partnerships,
such as internship opportunities for Rutgers
                                           students, involvement of Rutgers
students in after-school programming in all New
                                           Brunswick schools and the
Professional Development School with the Rutgers
                                           Graduate School of Education.

                                           I�m extremely proud of the
progress we�ve made to provide quality education to
                                           our 6,000 students and their
parents, such as:

                                           � Student test scores soaring up
to 95 percent on the New Jersey High School
                                           Proficiency Test, the largest
gain in the state;

                                           � Now over 1,000 computers in our
schools, with computer labs in each school,

the board. There are no campaigns, no campaign
                                           contributions, no special
interest influence and no self-promotion by elected
                                           school board members at the
expense of our children.

                                           The board is made up of people
just like me, whose only interest is to provide our
                                           children with the best possible
education at a cost our residents can afford. So if

and intend to vote on this ballot question, I
                                           hope you will join me in
rejecting the efforts of political candidates attempting to
                                           undo all of the progress we have
made with a board that puts our children ahead
                                           of politics. On Nov. 7, please
say �No� to politics in our schools and vote no on
                                           the Board of Education question.

Might I add that I am not against the elected Board of Education campaign.
But if I were to be a casual subscriber to this list to see whether the
campaigners are worth their salt, Paul's message would have made up my mind
to vote to "keep politics out of our schools."

Paul, you are such an aspiring demagogue.  You use one statistic to go off
on a derisive rant, completely ignoring one simple fact stemming from that
statistic -- people have the right to drop out of school when they hit
sixteen years.  For those teens for whom life on the streets seems a faster
way to make a buck -- I was one of them in my day, I dropped out for much
the same reasons -- the school system is not to blame.  The educators can
only do so much.

Next time, let's have one sentence of rhetoric and the rest of the paragraph
be informative.  You could take some lessons from Doctor Gillespie.

Check out this Gillespie character and his faulty logic. I'm copying his bs
editorial (from today's Targum) below, after my comments.

How can this guy claim positive results when 46% of entering students
actually graduate NBHS? This guy must be EXPOSED! We can't tolerate
pseudo-intellectuals. This professor is well-known and regarded in American
Studies. We need to boot such folk to the intellectual gutter, where they
belong. We need to utilize the public spotlight and SMASH fake claims and
shoddy logic. We need debates on these issues, we need debates on democracy,
elections, role of intellectuals and revolutionaries, the parties, history
of voter disenfranchisement/jim crow/apartheid in the US.----elaboration on
the 13th-15th amendments, voter rights act, economic position of oppressed
nationalities (minorities) and their relationship to the broader economy.
Let's start checking these out after the election and start exposing
apologist frauds like Gillespie. These are some of the questions I think
stand astride of the current education crisis in Abbott districts all over
NJ, etc.

Here are the words of a chump:

Board member asks N.B. to vote �no�



                                           By Angus Kress Gillespie
                                           Guest Commentary


                                           Lately we�ve been hearing a lot
about an important issue facing New Brunswick
                                           voters on the Nov. 7 ballot. For
the fourth time in eight years, New Brunswick
                                           residents are being asked to
consider switching to an elected school board. On
                                           each of the last three occasions
this question was posed to New Brunswick
                                           voters, it was overwhelmingly
rejected.

                                           As an educator and a long-time
resident of the City of New Brunswick, I would
                                           like to take a moment to tell you
just a few reasons why I believe you should vote
                                           �no� on the Board of Education
question.

                                           I have seen the remarkable
renaissance of this city that, unless you�ve been here
                                           for some time, is truly hard to
appreciate fully. Among the many achievements this
                                           city has realized over the past
few decades, perhaps most impressive are the
                                           accomplishments of the New
Brunswick public schools. This is a subject matter
                                           of which I can speak from
firsthand experience because I have the honor and
                                           privilege of serving as a member
of the New Brunswick Board of Education.

                                           Our University�s involvement with
the New Brunswick public schools has led to
                                           many successful partnerships,
such as internship opportunities for Rutgers
                                           students, involvement of Rutgers
students in after-school programming in all New
                                           Brunswick schools and the
Professional Development School with the Rutgers
                                           Graduate School of Education.

                                           I�m extremely proud of the
progress we�ve made to provide quality education to
                                           our 6,000 students and their
parents, such as:

                                           � Student test scores soaring up
to 95 percent on the New Jersey High School

gain in the state;

                                           � Now over 1,000 computers in our
schools, with computer labs in each school,
                                           and an average of four computers
with Internet access in every classroom;

The board of Ed has stated the dropout rate at 10% but upon questioning it is not clear exactly what this stands for (for ex. is it for the senior class)- you might want to try again. One teacher has said that noone knows what the real dropout rate is and this needs to be better measured.

Message:

To be fair, the Reform Party was never founded on really progressive
principles. It was based on a wealthy demagogue who promised
"solutions" for the "American worker" which often involved xenophobia and
racism, if hidden. Why not an outright fascist in that party? It didn't
have a real program, and it had a history of demagoguery. 

Certainly, Perot got progressive voters--in opposition to the two-party
system. The classic "protest vote." But the Reform Party does not equal
the Green Party.

Subject:Re: [nbpc] Bush for Pres.?
Message:

i honestly don't care if Gore is a liar. They are all liars, as far as I'm 
concerned. the question here is do we spend the next four years REELING from 
attack after attack from a man HELL BENT on destroying every progressive 
gain achieved in this country OR do we concentrate instead on building a 
REAL third party, from the ground up???????

the argument that it may be a good thing to have bush as president because 
it will 'mobilize' the people amounts to cutting off your nose to spite your 
face. the logic truly escapes me. i don't recall any grand mobilizations 
during the reagan/ bush eras.

i used to be an admirer of Ralph Nader. Now i'm convinced that he is more 
concerned with individual fame and celebrity than with any real 
party-building or seizing of power on behalf of working people.

plus, people should start paying attention to some of his political lines. 
like his statement this week that if R-v-W is thrown out by the Supreme 
Court it wouldn't really be that big of a problem cuz it would 'revert back 
to the states anyway'. wow. that makes me feel better. (see NY Times, 
October 31, 2000 "Democrats Ask Nader to Back Gore in Swing States")

if he really cared about the American people, he would REALIZE how fucking 
important it is that we do not wake up on november 8 with GW as president.

are matching funds the ultimate goal here? if everyone who's so concerned 
with 'voting with their conscience' would get out of their arm chairs and 
start organizing their communities locally so that third parties begin to 
sweep local elections, then we'd truly be on the path to something new. 
otherwise, it amounts to protest in the comfort of your voting booth.

Kristina, I think the point was more that at least he (Gillespie) puts 
forth a valid argument stemming from his main point.  Whether it's 
pro-machine rhetoric or not, if it's done right, people are going to listen.

Nine women, 1 man arrested in prostitution sweep 
Published in the Home News Tribune 10/31/00

By KEN SERRANO
STAFF WRITER 

NEW BRUNSWICK: A police sweep targeting Commercial Avenue street walkers over the weekend resulted in nine women being arrested for prostitution and related charges and one man for seeking their services. 
Michael Beltranena Jr., director of police for New Brunswick, said residents' complaints of prostitution in the area sparked the weekend operation, although similar sweeps are carried out periodically. 

Arrested on prostitution charges were city women Renee Tillman, 42, of Hale Street; Jannen Sharp, 31, who gave her address as the Howard Johnson Hotel on Route 1; Lisa Williams, 40, of Elm Row; Maltha Baker, 34, of Suydam Street; Michelle Fama, 31 of Comstock Street, and Winafred Washington, 37, of Reservoir Avenue. Also facing prostitution chares is Chris Anne Ciandella, 37, of Monmouth Junction. 

The women were charged after they solicited undercover officers posing as customers, according to officials. 

Wanda Rogers, 30, and Reni Schneier, 33, both of Comstock Street, were arrested on charges of loitering for prostitution purposes. 
The women either posted or were held in lieu of bail set at between $975 and $5,000. 

Louis Rojas-Vindas, 30, of Quentin Avenue in the city was charged with seeking the services of a prostitute and released. Earlier this month, the city agreed to establish an outreach program to try to get prostitutes off the streets as the result of a lawsuit brought by the family of Carolyn Adams. Adams, a 39-year-old prostitute, was fatally shot by a city police officer in 1996. 
But these women will not be candidates yet. The program is not up and running. The "Change a Life" program will include medical treatment, career counseling and child care.

Message:

Rhetoric, by definition, in the context I used it in, means as follows :  

rhetoric : language that is elaborate, pretentious, insincere, or intellectually vacuous, inflated language, pomposity.

Gillespie's article is conservative, in the sense that it aims to preserve the existing structure.  But 'rhetoric', a la Paul, it is not.  It is rather informative by comparison.

If you can't see that, Kristina, then it is pretty obvious that your bias transcends judgement by merit.  Given that circumstance, I would not trust you to be involved in any sort of government, where it is necessary to be objective, and not simplistically separate everything into 'us' and 'the machine.'  Or perhaps you see yourselves as 'good' while 'the machine' represents 'evil', the former infallible while the latter must invariably be malicious?

If it weren't for people like Zofia on the campaign, who put thought and compassion into their balanced judgements, the 'machine' would really start looking like the voice of reason.  Fanatics ruin the best intentions.

Subject:Re: [nbpc] RE: THE NADER FACTOR
Message:

An open invitation to debate.  Cool. :-)

Well, I disagree with the idea that a 'leftist-minded' person should vote
strategically for Gore, rather than vote on principle for Nader.  The
principle is simple:  one should not vote for a candidate whom one thinks is
'evil,' no matter how much less an evil.  In terms of actual policy, it is
true that a vote for Nader, which could potentially lead to a Bush victory,
would do harm for this country.  I have several things to say about this.

First of all, the actual damage this would do in terms of policy:  it's not
so drastic as it seems.  Bush is not a fascist, he's an old-style
conservative, old because he talks like a broken record and his policies are
pretty predictable.  But is Gore all that much different?  In truth, there
are few areas of some difference.  One is the Supreme Court:  Bush would
attempt to nominate conservative Christian-types, while Gore would
supposedly nominate liberals.  There is truth to this, but let's not get
carried away:  the Democrat-controlled Congress is to thank for Scalia,
Thomas, and others whose nomination they endorsed.  Lieberman, who is no
atheist himelf, has said on two occasions that he would have voted for
Bork's nomination.  Bork is worse than anyone on the Court now.

Another area of difference is gun control, and Clinton was able to get
somewhere with this, although not far.  But I think any serious improvement
is going to have to come through litigation, with the attack on the tobacco
industry as the model.  I can't think of too many other differences.
Abortion depends on the Court, but then again the Democratic Congress under
Reagan/Bush is partially to blame.  Health care is nowhere, despite
Clinton's best efforts;  the death penalty is wholly endorsed by Gore; the
environment is hardly an issue anymore, especially to Gore who is awash in
corporate sponsorship;  welfare policy was severely curtailed under Clinton.
The most important non-difference between the candidate is international
policy, which is identical:  the Pentagon hardly has much to fear from Gore.

By voting strategically for Gore, we do more than keep Bush out.  We give
him our consent:  he represents 'us.'  We all know this is a joke, that the
two-party system plays on our fears.  Yet, what motivation does Gore have to
do anything except move further to the right, more toward the so-called
'middle' of the political spectrum, the summit of the population pyramid?
Under Clinton/Gore, many 'progressive causes' were lost: welfare was rolled
back, we've bombed the hell out of a country illegally and immorally, and
we've watched the wealth gap increase.  It's a trend - Gore will hardly
'preserve' anything except his standing in his corporate sponsors' eyes.  On
the other hand, if the Democrats lose they will have no choice but think
'strategically' themselves, and at least move a bit more to the left.  If
we're lucky, perhaps the Greens will grow and grow over the long-term, and
one day the average person of this country will be able to live in a real
social democracy, instead of a backwards laissez-faire system with
institutionalized corruption and a government working hand-in-glove with its
corporate sponsors.

Paul,

Can I be labeled a bottom feeder too?

You know, for a moment, I regret taking so many of my
debates with you offline.

I wish to simply remind everyone that the narrow viewpoints
taken by some of the more vocal people on this list do not
represent everyone involved in the campaign. Although you
are certainly vocal enough (perhaps loud would be the right
word), neither of us are the voice of the campaign.

(Matthew) Right and wrong:  Nader's campaign has certainly been rushed. I 
received an email at the beginning of this summer that Nader was "really in 
it this time".  I was wondering where he had been for the last 3 1/2 years 
since his last run (read:walk) for presidency. And this gets to my biggest 
criticism of the Green Party/Nader campaign: They're trying to go for the 
head (ie: the throne) before they build up the body (a real mass movement)  
But, this is where our author friend goes wrong.  There's an immense amount 
of evidence that voters have been staying home for lack of a candidate that 
truly represents their interests.  First of all, the huge rallies of support 
that Nader has been getting is the most immediate indicator.  Also, most 
people are simply not benifiting from this golden-calf economy.  All the 
corporate downsizing means that countless people are put out of work, real 
wages are far lower than they were 20 or 30 years ago, job security is 
practically nonexistant, more people are working 2 and 3 jobs without the 
benifits, and if you haven't noticed the lack of democracy in the inner 
cities, then reconsider the meriad of marches and protests against police 
brutality in cities all over the country...these are people for whom 
low-income housing is being replaced with prisons.

This is where our author really lets his cynicism get the best of him.  The 
fact is that it would be an amazing and historic leap foward if the Greens 
got 5% of the vote (guaranteed Bush looses) But until Nov 7th at 8pm, this 
is amounts to reckless speculation and fantasizing for a quick solution to 
our country's deep social and economic problems.  IT AMOUNTS TO PLAYING 
RUSSIAN ROULLET WITH THE LIVES OF THE MOST VULNERABLE SECTIONS OF OUR 
POPULATION WHO WILL BE TROUNCED BY A BUSH VICTORY!

But we do indeed need a legitamate 3rd party movement. Again, the 
Green/Nader campaign should have been building up a UNITED FRONT/COALITION 
grassroots movement for the last 4 years, buy they haven't.  I saw Nader & 
Co. speak in Newark last week, and to be brutally honest, the audience 
didn't look a thing like Newark! It was primarily marginalized middle-class 
lefties from the 'burbs who came to Newark to declair themselves the 
People's Choice!  Bull-shit! Newark has a such deep and broad history of 
political and social struggle, countless community organizations that have 
for years taken on the "powers that be" fighting for more democracy and 
community control over the city's institutions.  Why weren't they 
represented?  The only Newark organization that I saw was the People's 
Organization for Progress, which has historically struggled against police 
brutality in Essex County and beyond.  A true third party movement has to 
include the entire spectrum of grassroots organizations, labor unions, 
student organizations, etc, etc. not one group or party to jump up at the 
11th hour and play savior at the risk of fucking us all for the next four 
years and more!

This is true and extremely important as we consider what it will mean to 
democratize the United States.  The only possible way that we can create the 
scope of change that is called for is to have a political aperatus 
completely entrenched in a broad based mass movement that is prepared to 
back up a call, let's say to abolish the Electoral College, or for that 
matter, the millionare's club called the Senate!

Check it out: At the Nader forum, that jerk who's running for NJ Senate for 
the Greens, Bruce Afrin, had the nerve to get up on stage and moralize about 
Corzine trying to buy a Senate seat (no kidding), claiming it would be 
better to have an "honest conservative"!  I quote: "I will be proud if my 
campaign causes Jon Corzine to lose the election" Afrin's lucky he didn't 
leave the Brick City with a brick up side his head.

Yeah, this really get me too.  It's very telling that so many Nader 
supporters that I speak to make this claim, to-wit: Even if Nader causes 
Bush to win, it will bring the revolution on because people will have a 
clear enemy.   This is more "quick sollution"-ism!  An instant movement in 
Nader, and if not, an instant movement in Bush!  This is sort of impatient 
and whimsical "organizing" is dangerous and stupid.  It is put out by people 
who don't want to commit to the real, bare-knuckels, down-to-earth, 
day-to-day struggle to build a strong, sustainable movement, And, dare I 
say, it is a line put out by people who generally have access to at least 
basic resources and modest levels of democracy--who aren't worst hit by the 
lack of democracy that is supposed to usher in the up-rising.  Look, if 
people are out of work, they will be tired most of the time just trying to 
make ends meet and feed the kids, probably too tired to fight.  However, 
more democracy, such as low unemployment and strong unions empowers people 
and gives them strength and the idea that they can win...therefor they will 
fight harder.  Same goes for inner cities where less democracy means more 
people in prison, schools falling apart, and more CIA-shipped drugs on the 
street.  I've never heard any of these folks say, "Heck, I hope that cop 
comes over here and wacks me with his billy-club...THEN the revolution will 
come!"


As for the
>Nader movement, it's well-meaning and broad but an inch deep. In Eric
>Alterman's trenchant words in the Nation, Nader's "nascent leftist movement
>has virtually no support among African-Americans, Latinos or
>Asian-Americans. It has no support among organized feminist groups,

>company are building a nonblack, non-Latino, non-Asian, nonfeminist,
>nonenvironmentalist, nongay, non-working people's left: Now that really
>would be quite an achievement."
>

Once again: A real (and future) third party movement must represent all of 
these forces and more.  It must be a coalition based united front of 
democratic people, classes, businesses, organizations, parties, and anyone 
else who will join in the historic effort to sieze political power away from 
the international corporate powers that Nader so elloquently admonishes.

>convention speech, Gore moved fitfully toward the center, and one can fight
>against his position on capital punishment and prisons, his trimming on gun
>control -- dispute all this and more far more effectively if he is 
>president
>than not.


All this said, let it be known that I am voting AGAINST the phycopathic 
Shrub and for Gore.  I congradulate Nader for bringing issues to the table 
that may not otherwise have been brought up in the mainstream media.  But I 
don't for a minute think that the Whore-Gore will represent the people's 
wishes any more than his punk imperialist predecesor, Clinton, did.  WE MUST 
BUILD THE INDEPENDANT POLITICAL PARTY MOVEMENT at the local level and build 
up from there!

So, to wrap up:  1) Keep Bush and his extreme right constituency out of 
office on Nov. 7  2) Keep Gore beholden to his consituency as long as 
possible (unions, black churches, environmental org.'s etc) but know that he 
can't be trusted either, ultimately, & 3) GET BUSY!!! Organize in your 
neighborhood, on your block, at work, in school, wherever you can in 
anticipation that the next election is right around the corner, and we're 
going to have to be ready.  Rememeber, there are NO QUICK FIXES!


And if you're still reading this, then your probably interested enough to 
want to know that in New Brunswick, we're preparing to take the majority in 
City Council on election day!  Our truly grass-roots People's Campaign has a 
multi-national ticket running on a revolutionary-democratic platform, and 
we've been campaigning even longer that Nader ;) in NB to fundamentally 
transform and democratise NB.  AND WE NEED HELP!  If you can come down for 
the day on Tuesday, Nov. 7th, or even for a few hours to help us get out the 
vote, it may make all the difference in this race...for more info, email me, 
or call the Headquarters at (732) 545-5756.

For the future...Matthew Smith

this is my question:

in 2001, when GW is president, will it have made one OUNCE of a difference 
that people voted for Nader? who will remember to the noble message that we 
would not vote for "evil". GW? Al Gore? the supreme court? congress? TVs? 
Radios? the police department? the American people?

when my right to choose is taken away; when affirmative action is crushed; 
when the Alaska wildlife preserve is decimated by oil companies; when social 
security is reduced to a windfall for Wall St.; when the government is 
privatized out to faith-based organizations; when public schools rot while 
charter schools bloom - boy, i sure will be happy that a select group of

Kristina,

What a wonderful line of thinking!  In fact, you've just about justified
why not to vote for the People's Campaign.

everyone:

i'm sorry that this debate has detracted from the main purpose of this 
egroup, which is the Campaign. For the record, I do not in the least bit 
equate voting for Nader the same as voting for the People's Campaign for 
city council. It's important to realize here that Nader has publically 
stated that he is not trying to win. big difference. we are trying to win, 
and actually gain some power. In Nader's own words:

"You miss the critical point: we seek long-term political reform
through a growing party that pushes the two parties toward reforms
that you have espoused over the years, thus far in vain."
NY Times editorial - Oct. 27, 2000

These are his words. I can not support voting for someone who believes the 
purpose of a political camaign is to shame/push the two main parties to " do 
the right thing".

Also, if the Green party was only trying to garner 5% of the vote for 
matching funds, they could easily target only those states where Gore is 
assured a victory and still get the 5%. It seems to me, however, that Nader 
is targeting specifically those states where Gore is weak so that Gore does 
not win. He does not want Gore to win. He wants Bush to win. I do not want 
Bush to win.

I hate the Democratic Party (witness my involvement in our campaign) but i 
can not support a man who is only trying to be a grand scale consumer 
advocate and whose political lines are actually pretty skewed.

I also think that real change, the kind that doesn't happen too often, can 
only come from a solid base of local grassroots organizing. I don't think 
voting for Gore will change anything. I do think working on the People's 
Campaign will.

Again, I'm sorry that this debate has shifted our attention from the 
important work at hand. Please let's unite around our upcoming victory on 
election day!!!

In Unity,
Kristina

Subject:RE: [nbpc] UNITE, UNITE, UNITE
Message:

Nader has not stated publicly that he is not trying to win.  He has stated
that it is not probable.  This simply means that he is not delusional.  He
has stated quite explicitly that they are indeed trying to win, as well as
gather as much support as possible.

The logic you are putting forth is precisely the sort of panicky drivel that
led to Clinton's election in 1992 and his re-election in 1996.  Everyone
bought into it and the Clintons, thus unchallenged, gave us a rollback of
democracy unseen in the Bush years. Put quite simply, they could pose as the
'lesser evil' and still do business as usual -- in effect, nothing different
than the Republicans.

It does no good to run around like Chicken Little and yell that the
Republicans are coming.  You will invite a dose of hysteria among the naive,
while those who contemplate the history of these arguments and wish to work
within the system to put an end to the existing monopoly and
unaccountability of power will just shake their heads at you.  The way to
move the Democrats to the left, in the near future, is to scare them with
third-party candidates and allow them to lose if necessary.

It is symptomatic of the Homo Sovieticus in some of you to play along with
the 'lesser evil' mentality.  Your arguments sound much like the ones used
to elicit the "98% support" for candidates back in the USSR.  "If you don't
vote for so-and-so, you are clearly supporting imperialism."

You cite passages to support a mind you have already made up, Kristina.  I
am not impressed with your train of thought.  Your suggestion that he is
merely a "consumer advocate" dismisses the platform of the Green Party,
which I will include below.  I suspect that you have dismissed it out of
hand, as you NJFO-derived folks have done dozens of times to any thought
that did not originate from the illustrious poet-revolutionary Amiri Baraka.
But yet, there is wisdom elsewhere in the world.  I encourage you to explore
it.

Grassroots Democracy
Every human being deserves a say in the decisions that affect their lives;
no one should be subject to the will of another. Therefore we will work to
increase public participation at every level of government and to ensure
that our public representatives are fully accountable to the people who
elect them. We will also work to create new types of political organizations
that expand the process of participatory democracy by directly including
citizens in the decision-making process.

Ecological Wisdom
Human societies must operate with the understanding that we are part of
nature, not separate from nature. We must maintain an ecological balance and
live within the ecological and resource limits of our communities and our
planet. We support a sustainable society that utilizes resources in such a
way that future generations will benefit and not suffer from the practices
of our generation. To this end we must have agricultural practices that
replenish the soil; move to an energy efficient economy; and live in ways
that respect the integrity of natural systems.


Social Justice and Equal Opportunity
All persons should have the rights and opportunity to benefit equally from
the resources afforded us by society and the environment. We must
consciously confront in ourselves, our organizations, and society at large,
barriers such as racism and class oppression, sexism and heterosexism,
ageism and disability, which act to deny fair treatment and equal justice
under the law.

Nonviolence
It is essential that we develop effective alternatives to our current
patterns of violence at all levels, from the family and the streets, to
nations and the world. We will work to demilitarize our society and
eliminate weapons of mass destruction, without being naive about the
intentions of other governments. We recognize the need for self-defense and
the defense of others who are in helpless situations. We promote nonviolent
methods to oppose practices and policies with which we disagree, and will
guide our actions toward lasting personal, community and global peace.

Decentralization
Centralization of wealth and power contributes to social and economic
injustice, environmental destruction, and militarization. Therefore, we
support a restructuring of social, political and economic institutions away
from a system that is controlled by and mostly benefits the powerful few, to
a democratic, less bureaucratic system. Decision-making should, as much as
possible, remain at the individual and local level, while assuring that
civil rights are protected for all citizens.

Community Based Economics
We recognize it is essential to create a vibrant and sustainable economic
system, one that can create jobs and provide a decent standard of living,
for all people, while maintaining a healthy ecological balance. A successful
economic system will offer meaningful work with dignity, while paying a
"living wage" which reflects the real value of a person's work. Local
communities must look to economic development that assures protection of the
environment and workers' rights, broad citizen participation in planning,
and enhancement of our "quality of life". We support independently owned and
operated companies which are socially responsible, as well as co-operatives
and public enterprises that spread out resources and control to more people
through democratic participation.

Feminism
We have inherited a social system based on male domination of politics and
economics. We call for the replacement of the cultural ethics of domination
and control, with more cooperative ways of interacting which respect
differences of opinion and gender. Human values such as equity between
the -sexes, interpersonal responsibility, and honesty must be developed with
moral conscience. We should remember that the process that determines our
decisions and actions is just as important as achieving the outcome we want.

Respect for Diversity
We believe it is important to value cultural, ethnic, racial, sexual,
religious and spiritual diversity, and to promote the development of
respectful relationships across these lines. We believe the many diverse
elements of society should be reflected in our organizations and
decision-making bodies, and we support the leadership of people who have
been traditionally closed out of leadership roles. We acknowledge and
encourage respect for other life forms and the preservation of biodiversity.

Personal and Global responsibility
We encourage individuals to act to improve their personal well being and, at
the same time, to enhance ecological balance and social harmony. We seek to
join with people and organizations around the world to foster peace,
economic justice, and the health of the planet.

Future Focus and Sustainability
Our actions and policies should be motivated by long-term goals. We seek to
protect valuable natural resources, safely disposing of or "unmaking" all
waste we create, while developing a sustainable economics that does not
depend on continual expansion for survival. We must counter-balance the
drive for short-term profits by assuring that economic development, new
technologies, and fiscal policies are responsible to future generations who
will inherit the results of our actions. Our overall goal is not merely to
survive, but to share lives that are truly worth living. We believe the
quality of our individual lives is enriched by the quality of all of our
lives. We encourage everyone to see the dignity and intrinsic worth in all
of life, and to take the time to understand and appreciate themselves, their
community and the magnificent beauty of this world.

The word around town is good.  As I was walking to work this morn a guy called out from across the street in encouragement.  I asked him about the weekend lockups and he said that the prostitution on Remsen has been known of for ages and nobody ever did anything about it until now, even though people in the neighborhood had tried.  He also hearkened to the oppression and 'black man hunt' that occurred in his neighborhood when the 2 cops shot eachother, what Keith has written about.

I was in Kinkos and the workers know of the campaign and think we will win.  We have whole families voting for us there.

Subject:where's the communication?
Message:

does anybody else see a problem with this?  who is 'we...all' when the message
gets sent to the major student activist listserves at rutgers, and nobody has a
clue about what is going on (as in, i have seen absolutely no msg's regarding
actual plans for saturday - maybe i'm subscribed to the 'wrong' lists?)?  i look
at egroups and what, 180 people on the ignite list, 76 on the starc list, 21 on
sunb, and more than 40 from the campaign list... granted, many are on multiple
lists, there are so many people who are interested in getting stuff done on
campus, but there is just an utter lack of communication of what is going down on
campus... why are people planning shit and not letting everyone know? maybe if
there was a sense of collaboration that was instilled, something might actually
be achieved instead of random pockets of activity that seem to accomplish
nothing...

i know im not alone in harboring this sentiment as i even feel im echoing what
other people have said... do we need a campus-wide activist listserve, a website,
what are people's ideas?  what needs to happen...?

if it's just me, that's fine, in such a case you can regard this msg as drivel...

Subject:synopsis of A Day Without Hate
Message:

Hello friends.  
I just wanted to follow up Ami's letter for those of you who may be 
interested in knowing more about what will be happening during this four day 
event.  
I agree with Ami. . .I, too, am tired of seeing senseless acts of hate.  This 
event has brought an amazing group of individuals together.  (Which, I feel, 
is a blessing in disguise.)  I feel empowered and motivated in creating a 
change that is reaching for a collective understanding of an interactive 
community built on kindness and successful communication. . .not ignorance, 
fear, and hate.  Can these four days make such a difference?  Yes. I already 
have learned so much and grown thanks to the many individuals involved with 
the organization of A Day Without Hate.  I feel confident that through the 
seminars, smiles, and outreach with music and art. . .we will be 
promoting/reminding our peers of the need for (and how to achieve) peace.    
I ask you to take a minute and read the synopsis that follows.  
Thank you.
With love,
Melissa Calabrese

A Day Without Hate
November 13-16

Imagine a day that stands up against the intolerance and negativity
present in the world.

Imagine a day that unites the Rutgers University and New Brunswick
Community. 

Imagine a week of kindness that culminates into a Day Without Hate.

Imagine that you and I could change the world. 

Help us make this a reality

We are looking for sponsors for funding as well as university student
group participation

Here is the synopsis for the weeks events. 

Monday, November 13:  For the Children
An assembly that will entertain and educate children at Lincoln School with 
interactive skits dealing with real life situations.  Our goal is to provide 
them with
conflict-resolution skills.  All students will receive literature to take
home and discuss with their parents.   We plan to set up a fair following the 
assembly that will allow the children to visit several stations concerning 
water issues
(provided by WaterWatch, an AmeriCorps program), communication skills, 
positive self-esteem, random acts of kindness, and art.  

Tuesday, November 14:  Diversity Day
With the recognition that there are several ways to communicate, we will
provide entertainment throughout College Ave, 
Douglass, Cook, Livingston and Busch campuses with music, theater,
artwork, and spirituality.  

Wednesday, November 15: Community and Self-awareness Day
This day, with the help of other organizations, we will focus on the
community and the self.  From clothing drives to blood donations, stress
management seminars to yoga workshops, we hope the individual will become
more aware of their personal actions.

Thursday, November 16: A Day Without Hate
This is a day of celebration and education.  First, a petition will be
circulated throughout the Rutgers community asking people to spend a day
without hatred.  Signers will receive a sticker to wear on November 16,
which will signify their participation in the program.  The pledge will be
placed as a display ad in the Daily Targum along with a list of the day's
events and an editorial explaining the motivation behind the establishment
of the day.  Again, all co-sponsors will be recognized.  

Second, throughout "A Day Without Hate", a series of seminars/events
discussing and focusing on hate, its causes, and solutions for dealing
with it will be held.  Each of these seminars will be run by a different
campus organization or department and will take place at a variety of
different locations throughout Rutgers.  "A Day Without Hate" will end
with a benefit concert and/or speaker.

If interested please e-mail contact phone number and we will reach you
asap

For questions only call: Ami Yares @ 247-9937 or Melissa Calabrese
@565-7969

MEETINGS WED NIGHT AT 9:15 at HILLEL 93 College Ave

I agreee to your beef with MTV just like wyclef said all you see in the

By the way see Deltron 3030 's album cover.


But back to the issue	it's Rock The Vote minus MTV but Plus Outkast,

	So they Fuckin' up Hip Hop, we can forgive them temporarily
because they are addressing an important issue, Voting. 	Oterwise, don't
support MTV, support underground Hip-Hop, and encourage others to the
same, then tell them why !!	PEACE - NJF AKA DJ JOSH

2-Lot's of people = easier to contect with more people in less time and

Actually you're wrong.
Voting does make a difference, especially on a local level.
Okay- There isn't much of a choice as far as the presidential race goes. I 
hate the two party system as much as I don't want Bush to become president.

You're not going to change the system from the top down anyway.

But you can change the corrupt system of government from the bottom up. You 
can vote and make a difference here in New Brunswick. In case you haven't 
heard the news yet- there are 3 candidates running for city council, who are 
backed by a 17 point platform, and have pledged to struggle against 
corporate corruption in New Brunswick.

You claim to be protesting the system by refusing to vote. Really you are 
just perpetuating the system and giving corporations the power to continue 
doing whatever the hell they want!

By voting you can protest corporate power (i.e. J&J) and change the system 
starting on a local level. You can't change the world in a day, it takes 
small steps, and seizing power on a local level is a step towards democracy, 
changing the corrupt system of government and taking power back from the 
corporate elite.

In Unity,
Audrey Allred

Actually, there IS a protest being organized AGAINST rock the vote.  People
are organizing Mock the Vote... for some of us, it is to protest the
electoral process and our corrupt system of government, in which voting will
do absolutely nothing -- corporations will still own and control America, 
and
the rich (meaning the 2 major candidates that are running) will run the
country.  For others, the Greens, this is a protest against the 2-party
system and the exclusion of Ralph Nader and 3rd party candidates...  we are
all working together because while are opinions do differ, we have enuf
similarities that a joint effort is worthwhile.

Subject:Why Not to Mock the Vote
Message:

Hi folks,

I happen to think that you need to make the most out of situations, and to 
that end, many of us are working around the clock in the People's Campaign 
to win a city council election.

This campaign could break the back of a vicious machine which is responsible 
for terrorizing black and latino neighborhoods, throwing people out of their 
housing, denying an effective education and systematically stripping people 
of their money and dignity for over THIRTY YEARS!

We can win this election if people turn out. That means working people, 
especially oppressed people, have much to gain by voting. Locally. And 
students play a major role in this local election.

And now this show comes to town, with hip groups putting out decent 
messages. And a really big crowd is coming to see them. And much of that 
crowd may be thinking about how to vote. The People's Campaign will be 
engaging every possible person about their role this coming Tuesday because 
the future of New Brunswick depends on it.

Straight up, I think Mock the Vote is irresponsible towards local politics.

Further, these artists have worked years and years to perfect their art, and 
if you protest the event, you may as well protest their work.

If you're protesting the lack of progressive culture over the airwaves, I 
suggest you go out and sponsor some shows of your own that promote positive 
culture. What positive will come of this Saturday? Many of us in People's 
Campaign have worked for years to get where we are now and some folks think 
it's cool to fight the man by fighting every manifestation of corporate this 
and that. We can build relationships at this event and leave with 
substantive gains. Protest here will only promote the cynicism that keeps 
people away from the voting booth, which is what the corporations want. I 
say "Don't bite yourself in the ass"

New Brunswick council race a sign that election can't come soon enough

Star-Ledger - 11/03/00
BY ALEXANDER LANE
STAFF WRITER

Campaign sign disputes are nothing new in New Jersey, but yesterday the sign 
wars in New Brunswick took a turn for the weird.


A placard for three incumbent Democratic councilmen appeared on a fence 
outside the campaign headquarters of their archrivals, three independent 
candidates running as the People's Campaign.


And it's not going anywhere. Not legally, anyway.


The People's Campaign landlord is Peter Dalton, 32, owner of a property 
management company. Dalton gave a basement office to the populist upstarts 
for the last seven months, rent-free. Now he feels he has to give the town 
Democrats a plug, too, by letting them put a sign on his property.


If this nasty city council race were a tug-of-war, Dalton would be the rope.


Dalton, a personable sort, seems a little naive when it comes to dicey local 
politics. He graciously gave the People's Campaign free use of the basement 
office, thinking he was doing a favor for neighborhood chums.


Then the election drew closer, and heat came from all sides.


"The city doesn't like me now. They call me up and they tell me," said 
Dalton. "I got to work with the city, you know what I'm saying?"


His brothers, one of whom works as a school bus driver in New Brunswick, 
even chastised him for taking on City Hall. "They hate me because I got 
People's Campaign in my basement," Dalton said.


Arguments erupted between Dalton and his wife, who is convinced the city 
will take revenge on their business, he said.


"One time, she came in and wrecked the whole office," Dalton said. "The 
People's Campaign helped me clean it up."


One thing is for sure, Dalton said, the People's Campaign stays. He promised 
the group an office until Nov. 8, and he does not intend to kick them out.


"If I told somebody I'm going to do something I'm going do it," Dalton said. 
"I just got a good heart and I want to help people out. That's what I do. If 
the Democrats came to me first and said they wanted my basement, I would've 
helped them out first."


When the Democrats asked if they could put up signs on all six of the 
properties he owns in the city, including the office at 149 Redmond St., 
Dalton said yes. So as far as Dalton is concerned, the signs stay, too.


But People's Campaign candidate Keith Joseph, who is running with Curtis 
Warren and Diego Morales, said it's a little more complicated than that.


"This is a neighborhood I live in, and I don't think it's going to last very 
long," Joseph predicted, though he stopped short of saying just how it would 
disappear.


"It's a desperate move on their part to put their sign in front of our 
office," Joseph said. "They try to intimidate people into putting up their 
stuff, and I think it's because they have no support in the community."


Dalton said the city stopped short of intimidation. "They're not bullying 
me. But yet they're not doing any favors for me, either," Dalton said.


T.K. Shamy, the campaign manager for incumbent Democrats Joseph Schrum, 
Robert Recine and Jimmie Cook, said he has never been to the People's 
Campaign headquarters and did not set out to irk them with the political 
sign.


"Mr. Dalton is a supporter of ours. We asked him to put up some signs, he 
put up the sign." Shamy said. "His brother and I went to grammar school 
together. He's been a New Brunswick resident for years. It doesn't surprise 
me that they're supporters of the (Democratic) candidates."


But Dalton said he does not care to take sides.


"My back is up against the wall, really. I want to help both people," Dalton 
said. "I'm putting my neck out . . . I'm in a weird situation here."


It's bound to get weirder before Tuesday. The man who got himself in trouble 
by being too generous is trying to dig himself out with more generosity -- 
Dalton gave a $700 campaign contribution to the Democrats early this week.

Subject:Poll report W1 D 4,5
Message:

Perhaps each can report to the list from their site?

I was challenger in W 1, D4 and D5.

1. I counted the tickets that are taken at the polling machine for W1 D5 and 
they were 7 more than the votes that the machine registered - so 7 votes 
were lost.  The 2 poll clerks I worked there with let me count the tickets 
to be able to confirm this, and they confirmed my number. The machines are a 
pain because they dont seem to have a foolproof system.  There are 2 beeps - 
one before voting generated by the poll clerk to prepare for the voter and 
one after generated by the voter entering their vote.  If the voter forgets 
to press enter or the poll clerk spaces for a moment in high activity and 
doesnt clear the machine for the next voter (and we needed more poll 
clerks), then the votes seem to get swallowed. I was trying to keep track 
for the 2 beeps on each machine but things go so fast and once a beep does 
or doesnt happen you cant scroll back in time to check it again.  W1 D4 
didnt let me count their tickets at the end so I dont know about that. They 
told me that is not what I was challenger for, its just just for the 
individual voters, not checking the final tally.

Before I went to check the consistency between tickets and the machine I 
heard them discussing something about it.  I asked them is there a 
discrepancy.  They said no.  One challenger joked, your so worried about the 
big bad democratic machine.  So I went and checked it myself and it didnt 
work out.  Then they admitted there was indeed a discrepancy.

Once I was out of the room and came back and heard several beeps in a row.  
I asked them if they had heard it too.  The voter leaving the machine seemed 
confused about it.  They looked at me and said no, but it seemed hesitant 
and they didnt attack me for making that claim.

2. We had the bold "NO" self-made challenger badge situation, but it never 
got used at our site, it just lay on the table.  After the court decision on 
the day of the election that prevented them from using their own challenger 
badges within the polls (after it had been used already), one gentleman wore 
the approved NO badge in addition to his Democratic badge which was alot 
less obvious.

3.  There was a PTA bake sale going on within the 100-foot line of the 
polling site.  People were milling about. These folks were not openly 
electioneering.  Apparently they have done this several times in the past 
years.

4.  At one point there were 3 challengers for Recine.  They didnt seem to be 
aware of the rules.  Once I explained them they switched to become a 
challenger for Gore.

5.  The candidates Recine and Cook were audibly critical of our candidates 
to eachother within the polling site 3-4 meters from the polls. I dont think 
they realized this was wrong though.  They were just talking to the 
challengers.

6.  They had no idea what the terms of use of the provisional ballots were 
and at one point placed the ballot directly in the orange pouch with no 
envelope so that the poll clerk saw the votes.  I ended up going into the 
pouch to find the envelopes for them which I think was a violation.  There 
were also fuzzy rules around who could use the ballot.  I ended up using 
this test, "Did you register to vote in NB?"  Fuzziness was around if the 
person hadnt voted in years, also if they had moved to NB but their kids got 
new registration in NB and they hadnt and thought they had been transferred 
because their kids were via the high school registration, or if they tried 
to register after the 30 days and the MCBOE let them and gave them an ID 
number. In these cases we also gave them a ballot.

7. One woman didnt understand the school board ballot question and I 
explained what yes and no meant.  She wanted to file a complaint when I told 
here that was possible but the poll clerks said there were no complaint 
forms. Flavio was there at that time and we got them to search their forms.  
We found a complaint form but it was too late she had left.

8. Explanations of how to vote in the machine sometimes included pointing a 
bit of a  sweep down the Democratic line with a little here and there  so it 
was hard to pinpoint any obvious violation.  I had a hard time checking what 
they were doing when the poll clerks were explaining to people by pointing 
within the machine how to vote, since I couldnt see in well.

9. In general, with Flavios work we were able to establish some type of 
rationale at the site for orderly voting.

10.  Note on the walking lists which should have been organized by last 
name.

11. Since the day was such a family and friends affair, people were coming 
up and chatting with the challengers all the time.  I didnt challenge this 
because the challengers were already testy with me.

Incumbents sweep in heated New Brunwick race 

11/08/00

BY ALEXANDER LANE
STAFF WRITER

















It was politics New Brunswick- style, and it wasn't pretty. 


Three Democratic councilmen in the Hub City fended off a slate of independent People's Campaign candidates, winning by more than a 2-to-1 ratio. 


And the Democratic Party defeated a push to change the school board from a body appointed by the mayor to one elected by voters. 


In the process, the mayor's right-hand man allegedly punched a citizen activist in the face and frustrated Rutgers students who'd been turned away from the polls complained their votes were being suppressed. Democratic op
eratives were criticized for wearing illegal challenger badges into polling places. And city police officers worked overtime at the polls, prompting accusations they were there to intimidate potential voters. 


Perhaps the day's ugliest incident was in the morning outside the Lord Stirling School polling place, where Kevin Jones, an aide to Mayor James Cahill, argued with Joe Smith, an activist who advocated an elected board of 
education. 


Witnesses said Jones objected to Smith's standing too close to one of the Democrats' signs. The argument came to an abrupt end when Jones allegedly punched Smith in the face, drawing blood, police said. 


Police Director Michael Beltranena said Smith was at fault. "Smith assaulted Kevin Jones, Kevin Jones defended himself. They were both asked if they wanted to sign complaints; they declined to sign complaints," Beltranena
 said. 


Smith and witnesses friendly to him said Jones, who is considerably bigger than Smith, was the aggressor. 


Jones, who earns $40,000 a year for his city job, would not talk about the incident. "No comment. I'll see you after the election," he said. 


The incident was one of three run-ins with the New Brunswick police for Smith. Later, acting on an anonymous phone tip, they arrested him for failing to appear in North Brunswick Municipal Court for a speeding ticket Mond
ay. Before dawn he was arrested for allegedly throwing eggs at a group of men putting up Democratic election signs, a charge Smith denied. 


Meanwhile, at Lincoln School, near the Rutgers campus, many students trying to vote were rebuffed for a variety of reasons throughout the day. People's Campaign activists said there was a concerted effort by the city to s
uppress the unpredictable student vote. 


Michelle Shin, 21, a Rutgers senior, said poll workers sent her to four different polling places before she finally arrived back at Lincoln School, where she had gone originally, to vote. "It's like a trail of tears. I go
t out of class at 2:10, and it's 3:10 now," Shin said. 


Ron Gambone, 23, a Rutgers senior, said he registered five weeks ago, but he did not appear on the rolls at Lincoln, and he was forced to vote by paper ballot. 


"They should make sure registered voters get on that list," Gambone said. "Not voting on a machine makes me more wary, especially when they tell you your vote may not count (if your eligibility cannot be verified)." 


Robert Reck of the Middlesex County Elections Board acknowledged many students were encountering problems voting, but said they are often difficult to keep track of because they frequently change addresses. 


But People's Campaign activists did not believe the confusion at Lincoln School was unintentional. 


"We're investigating the filing of charges against the poll workers here. It's a pattern, it was a pattern when I was a student here 12 years ago," said attorney Flavio Komuves, who represents the People's Campaign. 


Democratic poll challengers at several sites wore badges advocating an appointed school board in the polling area until the county elections board forced them to remove the unofficial credentials after a hearing in the mo
rning. 


People's Campaign activists also complained that too many city police were stationed at polling sites. A 1985 federal consent decree -- prompted by charges that police were intimidating potential voters -- prohibits more 
than one officer per site, but up to six were at Lincoln and Lord Stirling at various times. 


Beltranena said he added officers to keep the peace after the 
confrontation between Jones and Smith. He said the consent 
decree allows him to increase the number of officers at stations if 
necessary.

Jones, who earns $40,000 a year for his city job, would not talk about the incident. "No comment. I'll see you after the election," he said. 


The incident was one of three run-ins with the New Brunswick police for Smith. Later, acting on an anonymous phone tip, they arrested him for failing to appear in North Brunswick Municipal Court for a speeding ticket Mond
ay. Before dawn he was arrested for allegedly throwing eggs at a group of men putting up Democratic election signs, a charge Smith denied. 


Meanwhile, at Lincoln School, near the Rutgers campus, many students trying to vote were rebuffed for a variety of reasons throughout the day. People's Campaign activists said there was a concerted effort by the city to s
uppress the unpredictable student vote. 


Michelle Shin, 21, a Rutgers senior, said poll workers sent her to four different polling places before she finally arrived back at Lincoln School, where she had gone originally, to vote. "It's like a trail of tears. I go
t out of class at 2:10, and it's 3:10 now," Shin said. 


Ron Gambone, 23, a Rutgers senior, said he registered five weeks ago, but he did not appear on the rolls at Lincoln, and he was forced to vote by paper ballot. 


"They should make sure registered voters get on that list," Gambone said. "Not voting on a machine makes me more wary, especially when they tell you your vote may not count (if your eligibility cannot be verified)." 


Robert Reck of the Middlesex County Elections Board acknowledged many students were encountering problems voting, but said they are often difficult to keep track of because they frequently change addresses. 


But People's Campaign activists did not believe the confusion at Lincoln School was unintentional. 


"We're investigating the filing of charges against the poll workers here. It's a pattern, it was a pattern when I was a student here 12 years ago," said attorney Flavio Komuves, who represents the People's Campaign. 


Democratic poll challengers at several sites wore badges advocating an appointed school board in the polling area until the county elections board forced them to remove the unofficial credentials after a hearing in the mo
rning. 


People's Campaign activists also complained that too many city police were stationed at polling sites. A 1985 federal consent decree -- prompted by charges that police were intimidating potential voters -- prohibits more 
than one officer per site, but up to six were at Lincoln and Lord Stirling at various times. 


Beltranena said he added officers to keep the peace after the 
confrontation between Jones and Smith. He said the consent 
decree allows him to increase the number of officers at stations if 
necessary.

**********************************************************************************

I am pleased and impressed with the thoroughness of Zofia's report which will go a long way towards enforcing our promises to the community and the campus of zero tolerance for voter suppression.  

In that vein, I would like each of the thirteen poll captains to make similar reports for the express purpose of using them in litigation.  Make them soon while your memory is fresh!  I do NOT, however, want them posted on the group.  They should be sent to me and to Campaign Manager Xavier Hansen at Flavio.Komuves@... and xavier.hansen@..., respectively.  Others with knowledge of violations should also send reports of same to me and Hansen as stated above.  They should not be shared with anyone except other poll captains.

Please also give to me or Hansen all contemporaneous notes that you took that day, keeping a copy for yourself.

With that said, however, let me add some things:

1. When you refer to somebody, tell me their name, physical description and the capacity in which they were acting e.g. poll judge, democratic challenger, etc.  Since most poll workers were photographed or videotaped, tell me who did it and tell me the time they were photographed or videotaped.  (This is my sole criticism of Zofia's report and I will most definitely need such information).

2. When you refer to an event, tell me the time it occurred; if at a polling site, tell me what ward and district it occurred at.

3. Any repeated activity of electioneering by candidates, poll workers, or challengers inside should be reported.  I am not interested in a voter talking with a friend working the polls on an isolated basis; I want the repeat violators.

4. With respect to the provisionals, I need the list of the names and phone numbers or addresses of all persons who were given OR refused provisionals.  With respect to each, state: (1) why were they given a provisional, e.g. name not in the book, wrong address, etc.; (2) were they asked for ID?; (3) was ID presented, and if so, what was that ID; and (4) were they given a ballot or not?  Please also let me know the total number of provisionals for your ward and district.

5. With regard to white "no" ribbons (not the pieces of cardboard they were replaced with), give me the names or descriptions of all persons wearing or possessing them and the time when they took them off.

Thanks.

Flavio L. Komuves
General Counsel

Englewood Voters Approve Shift to Elected School Board
By MARIA NEWMAN

Voters in Englewood, N.J., decided on Tuesday that they wanted to elect the 
members of their school board, rather than continue to have the mayor 
appoint them.

The ballot measure was approved by a vote of 4,289 to 3,427 after a 
hard-fought campaign in which a group of homeowners, Concerned Residents of 
Englewood, told voters in frequent mailings and telephone calls that 
electing a board was the only way to improve the city's low- achieving 
schools.

"This is great tribute to democracy in Englewood," said Eugenia Vogel, a 
supporter of the ballot measure. "If you elect somebody to do the job and 
they don't do the job, then you vote him out of office."

But Mayor Paul T. Fader and another group, Englewood Citizens for Education, 
warned that changing the method of choosing board members would not 
guarantee better schools.

Englewood is the only school district in Bergen County with an appointed 
school board. Attempts to make the board an elected one failed here in 1975 
and 1980.

Mr. Fader said he was not surprised that the ballot measure was approved 
this time, especially because its supporters raised more than $28,000 for 
their efforts, according to election campaign records.

"It was clear to me it would pass," he said, "but it's also clear to me that 
it's not in the best interest of the city."

The mayor said he feared that only candidates with enough money to wage 
expensive campaigns would consider running for the board. He also said that 
voter turnout at school board elections was historically low in New Jersey, 
so a small and elite group of residents could end up deciding the board's 
membership.

But Mr. Fader said it was hard to compete with the pro-election campaign.

"It's very difficult to go out and tell the public they should vote against 
their right to vote," he said.

Englewood, which has a large wealthy community and high property taxes, has 
some of the poorest test scores in Bergen County, and almost half of its 
school-age children attend private schools.

The district has also been involved in a costly 15-year legal battle to keep 
a well-to-do neighboring community, Englewood Cliffs, from pulling its 
students � most of them white � out of Englewood High School, which is a 
disproportionate 97 percent nonwhite, and placing them in another public 
school.

Mr. Fader said the schools have improved since Dr. Joyce Baynes was named 
superintendent two years ago, and he said he thought those improvements 
would have continued under an appointed board.

"This group has not articulated any educational goals," Mr. Fader said. 
"They haven't talked about the need to reduce class sizes, which we've 
already done, or to create magnet schools, which we did. Now it's incumbent 
upon the people who have expressed an interest in education to articulate 
their vision for the schools.

"Some very wealthy people were willing to put a lot of money into this 
campaign for this measure," Mr. Fader said. "Was it their goal to improve 
education here, or just to cut the school budget? I guess we'll find out in 
the next two years."

Mrs. Vogel said the changes would not come immediately.

"Eventually they will get better," she said. "Not right away, but very soon, 
maybe in two years."

According to state law, the board will increase to nine members from its 
current seven. An election must be held in 60 days to elect the two new 
members. Elections will be held to replace the other members when their 
terms, which are staggered, are up. In about two years, the entire board 
will be elected.

Englewood was one of 19 school districts in the state that had an appointed 
school board, according to the New Jersey School Boards Association. On 
Tuesday, voters in New Brunswick rejected, for the fourth time in seven 
years, a measure to elect their board members. In Elizabeth, where voters 
have selected the school board since 1988, the City Council placed a measure 
on the ballot to return to an appointed board, but voters rejected the 
proposal by a 2-to-1 ratio.

In New Brunswick, voters deserve better 


Published in the Home News Tribune 11/10/00
A Home News Tribune editorial
The New Brunswick Democratic Party shouldn't be bragging about how voters 
reinstated three incumbents to the City Council this week. Instead, if party 
officials want to keep their credibility, they'd better start taking 
opposition seriously.

The party's dismissal of rivals shows not only the arrogance of power but the 
foolishness of thinking there's no way to lose it.

The folks who oppose the grip the Democratic party holds on the city aren't 
going to disappear - nor should they. Who knows how much more money and 
support they'll garner before Mayor James Cahill's term expires in two years? 
Maybe by then their quest might not seem so quixotic.

"The People's Campaign didn't actually lose, we learned," says Curtis L. 
Warren, who ran for council. "This is just a practice for two years from now, 
when we go after two City Council seats and the mayor's office."

During the fall campaign for council, the city's Democratic political 
organization refused to debate The People's Campaign, a new and hodgepodge 
group of residents who were offering alternatives to entrenched Democrats.

The lack of debate accomplished two things. First, it denied residents the 
opportunity to hear and question the two camps' competing visions of New 
Brunswick and thus make more informed decisions about who should run the city 
and its public schools.

Second, it left the Democratic Party vulnerable to allegations City Hall 
officials harass opposition groups.

Why was The People's Campaign forced a few days before the election to move 
its headquarters of five months? Were any Rutgers University students 
intimidated on Election Day by city police officers stationed at polling 
places? Why was there a scuffle between the organizer of the movement to 
bring an elected school board to the city and a poll challenger for 
Democratic City Council candidates?

To be sure, all sorts of positive changes are happening in New Brunswick -- 
from a fledgling regional charter school on Commercial Avenue to a 
reinvigorated downtown. But as the city grows more sophisticated, so, too, 
should its Democratic leaders.

Elizabeth voters couldn't be fooled

A Home News Tribune editorialThankfully, voters in Elizabeth saw through 
slickly worded rhetoric and recognized exactly what Mayor J. Christian 
Bollwage and City Council President Manny Grova Jr. wanted them to do Tuesday 
- give up their right to vote for the people who run the Elizabeth School 
Board. 
The public question on switching from an elected school board to a 
mayor-appointed one lost 10,327 to 5,260.

There are many ways to ease the challenges facing New Jersey's urban public 
schools. Whether the board is appointed or elected won't be the determinant 
of students' success. In fact, some could argue it makes no difference at 
all, because urban school districts with both elected and appointed boards 
are failing. 

But given the possibility of enabling taxpayers to choose the people who run 
their public schools and raise their taxes, or letting an elected official do 
their bidding for them, it's far better to let taxpayers, not politicians, 
hold board members accountable.

Student voters must take action
Commentary 


By Derek Broderick
Guest Commentary 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--



The Targum’s coverage of the difficulties Rutgers students faced in casting 
their vote on election day fell short of addressing the scope of the problem, 
and failed to identify important trends in those who were turned away at the 
polls (The Daily Targum, Nov. 8). 

I volunteered as a poll challenger for the People’s Campaign at the Sacred 
Heart School, where residents of Ward 2, Districts 1 and 2 were supposed to 
be able to vote. District 1 encompasses much of the Cook and Douglass 
campuses, including the Newell Apartments, Katzenbach, Lippincott and 
Nicholas residence halls. By my own estimation, one out of every three 
students from these residence halls who came to vote was not on the list of 
registered voters. All of these students claimed to have registered to vote. 
Many claimed to have received a sample ballot in the mail, and many came with 
their voter registration cards in hand.

Based on my own observations, and overlooked in Targum coverage, was the fact 
that this puzzling phenomenon of deregistered voters was disproportionately 
confined to those students who live in residence halls. There were only a 
handful of cases at my voting site of off-campus residents that had the same 
problems as on-campus students. At polling sites which did not encompass 
dorms, there were rarely more than 20 provisional ballots filled out. At the 
Sacred Heart School there were nearly 150, an overwhelming majority of these 
cast by students who lived in the residence halls. 

The most frustrating and disturbing part of the day for me occurred before 
noon, as the provisional ballots were running low. A call was placed to the 
Middlesex County Board of Elections, and an attorney for the City of New 
Brunswick agreed, in conjunction with the non-partisan poll judge, to pick up 
200 more provisional ballots. That city attorney did not bother to come back. 
The polling site soon ran out of provisional ballots, at which point frantic 
calls were made to the Board of Elections. During the hour and a half period 
that it took the Board of Elections to provide the necessary provisional 
ballots, upwards of 30 students left off of the voter registration lists were 
told that they could not vote, even if they had brought proof of registration 
with them. Many of these students were voting for the first time, and many 
had to go to work or class and could not come back later to vote. 

The Targum’s assertion in an editorial that said, “In order to obtain a 
provisional ballot they had to speak with the state attorney general and 
obtain a signed affidavit” (The Daily Targum, Nov. 8) is factually 
inaccurate, and is a lie that was used at the voting site by Democratic 
Challengers who were actively seeking to drive away the student vote. Anybody 
left off of the lists that did not have a court order and wanted to vote had 
to “sign an affidavit saying he registered within 30 days prior to the 
election,” at which time that person was able fill out a provisional ballot. 
Those voters who returned with a court order were allowed to vote in the 
voting booths. 

Rather than titling the editorial “Fix the city’s machines,” the Targum 
should have dropped the apostrophe and recognized that it is time to “Fix the 
City Machine” that year after year suppresses the student vote. The fact that 
such a disproportionate number of those left off the list are students that 
live on campus is no more of a coincidence than the fact that The People’s 
Campaign carried Ward 6, District 3, a district with an extremely high 
population of students. 

Bearing direct witness to such widespread voter suppression has led me to 
believe that the work of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and 
the Freedom Riders is not yet complete in this country. The Targum’s 
minimizing coverage and failure to recognize this as a civil rights issue is 
a threat to the Democratic freedoms of the students of Rutgers. The City of 
New Brunswick cannot be trusted to reform the current system — as the 
editorial suggested — because the city relies on the suppression of student 
votes to keep the corrupt city machine going. Such widespread and systematic 
denial of voting rights is worthy of state and even federal investigation. 
The people of New Brunswick must stand united and demand our right to vote.

Subject:Re: [njfo] Pondering the election
Message:

DLJ-  Couple of points:

First, I didn't vote for Nader, or FOR the lesser of two evils.
I voted AGAINST the GREATEST evil...an ignorant serial killer whose 
interests lie firmly with the Oil Barons who carried out the Persian Gulf 
Massacre, and whose idea of a domestic program is a fast track to a 60 
billion dollar missile defense system.  I've never thought for a moment that 
Gore is a progressive who will rescue us from immenent melt-down, and he'll 
most likely maintain the embargo against Iraq, Cuba, etc. but he's not Bush, 
no matter how much the Greens or anyone else wants to insist on this. Point 
in fact: Why is it that the flip side of the argument to vote for Nader was 
almost invariably "Well, maybe if Bush wins, then it'll galvanize the 
resistance and the people will rise up quicker." ?!?  I suggest it's that 
most people, Greens included, realize that Gore is in fact to the left of 
Bush, if only a sliver, and is certainly not beholden to the Bob Jones 
constituency who advocate "pick-up truck justice" in lieu of a "jury of your 
peers".  And for the record, Hillary, while she can be very reactionary and 
sleezy on many issues (i.e. the Palestinian Question) is to to the left of 
Gore. Witness her recent call for the abolishment of the Electoral College 
and direct vote!

Secondly, Nader is not the great utopian thinker that he's made out to be.  
He's actually down right reactionary on issues such as States Rights (ie: 
his position that under Bush, abortion would merely go back to the states 
and not actually be abolished!!)  This shows that he has no real grasp of 
the history of states rights in the US, and how they have always been used 
to turn the clock backward on Civil Rights struggle.  This further points to 
the lack of any working relationship with the grassroots in the urban 
centers, as was evident when I saw him speak in Newark.  With the exception 
of Larry Hamm and a handful of POP-ers, the audience looked more like a 
Greatful Dead parking lot than an epicenter for decades of revolutionary 
struggle and the heart of the Black Arts.  & I don't accept their excuse 
that it was a last minute event.  It clearly shows that the Greens and Nader 
were trying to ride ripples left from the recent wave of protests (police 
brutality, Seattle, IMF, etc), formerly-disallusioned now middle class 
lefties going for the HEAD (president, congress, etc.) rather than building 
the BODY (GrassRoots Coalitions, United Front work, local office) AS IN 
PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN.  Why is it that in our first ever election in NB, the PC 
was able to get almost 3 times as many votes for City Council as any of the 
Green Party Candidates got in in NB for president or congress?  It's because 
the People's Campaign has put itself out there as an alternative to the 
alternative.  If we're going to build a third party movement, then it has to 
be through this sort of broad based Coalition building.
Otherwise, if we followed the Green's model, then NJFO for instance would 
have just run for City Council ourselves!  Actually, if we did that, and was 
Bush running in NB on the Republican ticket, then I would be telling people 
two things: 1. to vote for Crook Racist & Scum to keep Bush out, and 2. that 
NJFO, while it's intentions are admirable, is trying to become a white, 
middle-class messiah rather than the revolutionary democratic organization 
that we thankfully are, capable of leading a multi-national united front of 
democratic classes, that will ultimately topple the icy grip that the 
Machine has on NB; and which will indeed serve as a model that when 
developed elsewhere will be the vehicle with which the people can sieze 
power regionally and state-wide!

To sum up, the movement has to come from the bottom up, not the top down.  
Every Republican knows that the Greens/Nader played into their cold hands, 
but if the left movement remains defensive and indignant regarding this 
election rather than learn from it over the next four years, than we're 
doomed to repeat the same mistakes.

Matthew Smith

Subject: Bush Thanks Progressives
Date: Wed, 08 Nov 2000 01:24:39 -0800

A Note from our Next President:

Dear Progressives,
	I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank
you all for your hard work and dedication throughout
this trying election season. Of course your candidate,
Ralph Nader, didn't get the 5% he was after, which I
can assure you we Republicans regret, but you did
manage to throw the race so your efforts weren't
completely wasted. Jeb and I were especially worried
about Florida but after all was said and done you
really came through for us. So to show our appreciation
Dick, myself, and the Republican majorities in the
House and Senate promise a steady stream of
controversial proposals for you to rail against.
Opposing us will give meaning to your lives, and let's
not forget, as Ralph said, that it's good for
increasing membership. We know you care more about
ideology than reality, and we respect that. Thanks
again for all you have done. We look forward to working
with you.

Sincerely,
President Bush II

ps-4:20AM, Florida just reverted to toss-up
    all we can do is hope...

Subject:BOE campaign
Message:

Theres alot more to the BOE loss, I think (in addition to what happened on 
election day).  I dont want us to throw up our hands and say that money is 
the only way to go until we have maxed out local organizing.

A.  The same people who worked on it the last time have been doing it for 
years.  They recycled the same contacts, the same literature, the same 
slogans.  Their slogans/flyers were the same lies from the last time so they 
were relatively simple to lay out to print.  Our lit was very topic based 
and based on research that we were continually conducting, which took time 
and effort to develop. We also brought the issue to the local level and 
spent alot of time and energy doing advocacy as various issues came up - for 
union teachers for childcare, for information re: transfers, etc.

B. Many of our contacts could not go public because of fear.  Even 
supportive PTA presidents could not go public or invite us to their 
meetings, even if they were friends with people on the other side.  The 
local teachers union did not take a stand which we saw they did in 
Elizabeth, although the state level did.  The machine was able to get 
friends and landlords to put up a bunch of their signs, and as we learned, 
at least one was coerced.  At the same time the machine was able to use 
schools like St. Marys in closed private forums to get their word out to 
parents.

C.  Granted, money did do alot - they had about 7-10 mailings and lit drops. 
  When we finally got lit together that I was confident in we didnt have the 
money or time to get it out to everybody.

D. They had people in each local neighborhood sending out letters and having 
kaffeklatsches.  We had local people doing this work in  key neighborhoods, 
but perhaps not as many, and in  neighborhoods that we were more likely to 
win anyway.

E.  We didnt canvass all of NB.

F. I was running it for the PC and it took me a long time to become 
strident. My plan was to develop a large enough group of people that it 
would be all of us that would be doing the press work and advocacy, I didnt 
want it to be just me going out front since I am not known like Joy Sheehan. 
  So many of our contacts were not going out front, I kept on thinking it 
was my fault organizing or the lack of passion about the issue that wasnt 
getting them out and not the fact that they were so afraid. Still, many 
parents did come forward.  By the end I could see more clearly what was 
going on.

While we have to have enough to produce lit and flyers and we need money for election day, we must remember we will always get outspent by the machine.  That will never be our strongest asset, while we need to work on it.  In 1990 Cahill won by spending $ 500 K.  His opponent spent about $75K.

Folks-  Let's not get swept up in electoral politics, bourgeois style!  
While a "warchest" is crucial to electoral success, it is not principal 
asset we must obatain, and certainly not the pricipal reason for having 
lost.  From what I've heard, the results of the NB City Council election 
indicate that the People's Campaign received more votes from campus than we 
did from the community.  While this is a great tesamony to the level of 
organizing we reached on campus, it tells us that we have an immense amount 
of work towards consolidating support in the community.  It is this that 
seperates us from bourgeois politicians... we won't crawl off the wall-paper 
6 months before an election to coddle the community.  We will continue as we 
have before working with the community, building relationships and trust, 
and transforming institutions along with social consciousness.  This is our 
principal task and this, in 2002, will be the deciding factor.  Matthew

i am in no way advocating that raising money is the 'only way to go'. while 
organizing among the community (building trust) is our principle task (and 
yes what separates us from the opposition), being able to PAY our people to

one town. we made many sacrifices due to lack of money that could've made a 
big difference. if we were able to pay people to work full time, that 
would've made a HUGE difference in disseminating our message in the first

Activists call for basic democratic rights
Commentary 





------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--



Last week’s City Council race in New Brunswick was one of the most-contested 
in recent history. As the national elections are demonstrating immense 
systematic problems in our voting process, our local elections have revealed 
deep-seated corruption and blatant disregard for democracy. The People’s 
Campaign is currently assessing reports from every corner of the city, from 
polling places such as Lord Stirling, Schwartz-Robeson and Lincoln schools, 
among others. We are deeply disturbed by what these reports reveal.

Close to 1,000 people, both Rutgers students and community residents, were 
denied their right to vote in New Brunswick last Tuesday. Our city resembled 
Mississippi circa 1960 as the current city administration used violence, 
terroristic threats, fraud and racial slurs to deny our city any democratic 
electoral process. While hundreds of students were being turned away from the 
polls, voter cards in hand, operatives for the Cahill administration, some of 
whom are city officials, threatened and harassed community activists. Some 
People’s Campaign supporters were insulted with racial slurs, told to “go 
back to your own country,” and in one instance, physically attacked by an aid 
to Mayor Cahill. 

Inside the polls, illegal activity was commonplace: 

• Paid operatives for the Cahill administration openly engaged in partisan 
electioneering inside the polling place.

• Witnesses are reporting that voting machines were tampered with while 
people were told how to vote and illegally required to check in with 
“challengers” working for the incumbents. 

• The City Machine refused to grant provisional ballots to hundreds who had 
registered to vote this year on the grounds that they “couldn’t find” their 
names in the voter rolls. Their votes were effectively suppressed and we 
still have no guarantee that the hundreds of provisional ballots that were 
cast will even be counted.

The People’s Campaign was successful in overcoming external intimidation in 
New Brunswick. We won in the streets and we won on campus. For the first time 
in recent history, the Cahill machine was unable to prevent the organizing 
activity of an opposition ticket. The next step is to overcome internal 
intimidation and fraud and ensure a fair voting process.

We need to continue to struggle for democracy and we will not give up on that 
struggle. We are drafting a Report on Voter Suppression and Electoral Fraud 
in New Brunswick and calling for the establishment of a nonpartisan 
investigation committee. Everything we’ve learned should be used to struggle 
for fair elections in the future. We must demand independent monitors from 
the Board of Elections for all future New Brunswick races. If the board 
refuses, we will go to the United Nations.

To report your experiences on Election Day, whether you were denied the right 
to vote or not, you can reach us at right2votenb@..., or call us at 
732-545-5756. We are fighting, in the tradition of the civil rights movement, 
to overcome entrenched anti-democratic forces. New Brunswick will have 
democracy and the people of this city are fighting for it. Be forewarned, we 
will not rest until this goal is achieved.

FEDERALIST PAPERS


Federalist No. 68

The Mode of Electing the President
From the New York Packet
Friday, March 14, 1788.

Author: Alexander Hamilton

To the People of the State of New York:

THE mode of appointment of the Chief Magistrate of the United States is 
almost the only part of the system, of any consequence, which has escaped 
without severe censure, or which has received the slightest mark of 
approbation from its opponents. The most plausible of these, who has 
appeared in print, has even deigned to admit that the election of the 
President is pretty well guarded. [1] I venture somewhat further, and 
hesitate not to affirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at 
least excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages, the 
union of which was to be wished for.

It was desirable that the sense of the people should operate in the choice 
of the person to whom so important a trust was to be confided. This end will 
be answered by committing the right of making it, not to any preestablished 
body, but to men chosen by the people for the special purpose, and at the 
particular conjuncture.

It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men 
most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting 
under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious 
combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern 
their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens 
from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and 
discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.

It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible 
to tumult and disorder. This evil was not least to be dreaded in the 
election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency in the 
administration of the government as the President of the United States. But 
the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under 
consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief. The 
choice of SEVERAL, to form an intermediate body of electors, will be much 
less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent 
movements, than the choice of ONE who was himself to be the final object of 
the public wishes. And as the electors, chosen in each State, are to 
assemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen, this detached and 
divided situation will expose them much less to heats and ferments, which 
might be communicated from them to the people, than if they were all to be 
convened at one time, in one place.

Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should 
be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and corruption. These most deadly adversaries 
of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their 
approaches from more than one quarter, but chiefly from the desire in 
foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could they 
better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own to the chief 
magistracy of the Union? But the convention have guarded against all danger 
of this sort, with the most provident and judicious attention. They have not 
made the appointment of the President to depend on any preexisting bodies of 
men, who might be tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes; but 
they have referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the 
people of America, to be exerted in the choice of persons for the temporary 
and sole purpose of making the appointment. And they have excluded from 
eligibility to this trust, all those who from situation might be suspected 
of too great devotion to the President in office. No senator, 
representative, or other person holding a place of trust or profit under the 
United States, can be of the numbers of the electors. Thus without 
corrupting the body of the people, the immediate agents in the election will 
at least enter upon the task free from any sinister bias. Their transient 
existence, and their detached situation, already taken notice of, afford a 
satisfactory prospect of their continuing so, to the conclusion of it. The 
business of corruption, when it is to embrace so considerable a number of 
men, requires time as well as means. Nor would it be found easy suddenly to 
embark them, dispersed as they would be over thirteen States, in any 
combinations founded upon motives, which though they could not properly be 
denominated corrupt, might yet be of a nature to mislead them from their 
duty.

Another and no less important desideratum was, that the Executive should be 
independent for his continuance in office on all but the people themselves. 
He might otherwise be tempted to sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for 
those whose favor was necessary to the duration of his official consequence. 
This advantage will also be secured, by making his re-election to depend on 
a special body of representatives, deputed by the society for the single 
purpose of making the important choice.

All these advantages will happily combine in the plan devised by the 
convention; which is, that the people of each State shall choose a number of 
persons as electors, equal to the number of senators and representatives of 
such State in the national government, who shall assemble within the State, 
and vote for some fit person as President. Their votes, thus given, are to 
be transmitted to the seat of the national government, and the person who 
may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes will be the 
President. But as a majority of the votes might not always happen to centre 
in one man, and as it might be unsafe to permit less than a majority to be 
conclusive, it is provided that, in such a contingency, the House of 
Representatives shall select out of the candidates who shall have the five 
highest number of votes, the man who in their opinion may be best qualified 
for the office.

The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of 
President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent 
degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for low intrigue, 
and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the 
first honors in a single State; but it will require other talents, and a 
different kind of merit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of 
the whole Union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary 
to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of President 
of the United States. It will not be too strong to say, that there will be a 
constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent 
for ability and virtue. And this will be thought no inconsiderable 
recommendation of the Constitution, by those who are able to estimate the 
share which the executive in every government must necessarily have in its 
good or ill administration. Though we cannot acquiesce in the political 
heresy of the poet who says: ``For forms of government let fools contest 
That which is best administered is best,'' yet we may safely pronounce, that 
the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a 
good administration.

The Vice-President is to be chosen in the same manner with the President; 
with this difference, that the Senate is to do, in respect to the former, 
what is to be done by the House of Representatives, in respect to the 
latter.

The appointment of an extraordinary person, as Vice-President, has been 
objected to as superfluous, if not mischievous. It has been alleged, that it 
would have been preferable to have authorized the Senate to elect out of 
their own body an officer answering that description. But two considerations 
seem to justify the ideas of the convention in this respect. One is, that to 
secure at all times the possibility of a definite resolution of the body, it 
is necessary that the President should have only a casting vote. And to take 
the senator of any State from his seat as senator, to place him in that of 
President of the Senate, would be to exchange, in regard to the State from 
which he came, a constant for a contingent vote. The other consideration is, 
that as the Vice-President may occasionally become a substitute for the 
President, in the supreme executive magistracy, all the reasons which 
recommend the mode of election prescribed for the one, apply with great if 
not with equal force to the manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable 
that in this, as in most other instances, the objection which is made would 
lie against the constitution of this State. We have a Lieutenant-Governor, 
chosen by the people at large, who presides in the Senate, and is the 
constitutional substitute for the Governor, in casualties similar to those 
which would authorize the Vice-President to exercise the authorities and 
discharge the duties of the President.

PUBLIUS.

President Hastert? President Thurmond? It Could Happen...

By CURT ANDERSON
.c The Associated Press
  
WASHINGTON  - Should a legal battle drag on for weeks between Al Gore and 
George W. Bush over the presidential election results, Americans could wake 
up in late January with a man named J. Dennis Hastert in the Oval Office. 

Hastert, a 14-year member of Congress from Illinois, is the Republican 
speaker of the House of Representatives. Under the Constitution, in certain 
circumstances when the president and vice president cannot take office by the 
Jan. 20 inauguration date, the House speaker takes the reins of power for the 
time being. 

Taking it a step further, if there is no speaker, or that person doesn't meet 
requirements to be president, the temporary White House occupant would be the 
president pro tempore of the Senate. That person is 97-year-old Sen. Strom 
Thurmond of South Carolina. 

Thurmond won 39 electoral votes in a 1948 run for the presidency as a "States 
Rights Democrat.'' 

But the duty, unprecedented in the nation's history, most likely would fall 
to Hastert, a former high school teacher and wrestling coach who took over as 
speaker in 1998 for conservative firebrand Newt Gingrich and has tried to 
steer a less confrontational course for the GOP congressional majority. 

"The House speaker would assume the position of acting president,'' said 
Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington 
University. "He would assume the position until any controversy is 
resolved.'' 

Hastert also would have to resign from the House, forcing the majority 
Republicans to choose a new speaker for the incoming 107th Congress and 
requiring a special election for the open 14th District seat in Illinois. 

"This is a remarkably bitter prospect for any House speaker in exchange for 
being a historical footnote,'' Turley said. "He would have to decapitate his 
political career.'' 

Still, Republicans could dodge that possibility by choosing someone else as 
speaker and letting that person resign to become temporary president. And 
nothing would prevent Hastert from running again for his Illinois seat once 
the Gore-Bush race is finished. 

The Constitution makes the speaker of the House third in the line of 
succession if both the president and vice president are unable to serve. 
Under the 20th Amendment - the one that limits presidents to a pair of 
four-year terms - the terms of President Clinton and Vice President Gore will 
end at noon on Jan. 20, when presumably the new team would be sworn in. 

The amendment says that if the new president and vice president aren't yet 
"qualified'' for their offices - a long legal challenge could delay the 
Electoral College from the final act of the 2000 election, naming the 
president - the law should dictate who should temporarily take over. Federal 
law identifies that person as the speaker, after he has quit the House. 

A separate provision would have the presidential election decided by the 
House of Representatives, with the Senate choosing the vice president. But 
that would happen only if neither Bush nor Gore got the required 270 
electoral votes. Florida would put either man over the top.

I'm still an agnostic on this question.  Here's why.  I'm not 100% 
certain that deemphasizing the state-by-state electoral vote system in 
favor of 'letting the popular vote decide' will be empowering to those 
places where the least politically powerful live.  To put it simply, 
is this strategically good for the political interests of the rural 
poor and the urban poor alike?  

Let's say you have state A and state B, and both traditionally go to 
the Democrats because of their large urban minority population, 
combined with, say, a large number of traditionally Democratic groups 
living in the suburbs (Catholics and Jews, for example).  This might 
roughly describe NY and NJ; I'm not thinking too hard here, though, so 
let's just keep it hypothetical.  The Republicans won't really even 
bother with these two states, usually, because the urban votes and 
some of the suburban votes will outweigh the more conservative 
suburban and rural voters by, maybe, 10%.  

Switch to direct election and you get this:  the Republicans will 
suddenly campaign vigorously to get the conservative votes from those 
two states, and be able to combine those votes to make them count 
nationally in a way they never could before.

This is just a (not that great) hypothetical.  But you get my point.  
There's just as much possibility for a swing in favor of the 
Republicans as there is in favor of the Democrats.

Well, first, 'direct democracy' in the sense of eliminating mediating 
factors between the individual voter and Congress, the President, etc, 
isn't necessarily a great thing.  It's definitely an excessive 
exaggeration to call it 'revolutionary'.   

Here's how I'd look at it.  Progressive reforms, in the traditional 
sense of the term 'Progressive', have always been quite 
well-intentioned in terms of advancing democratic empowerment.  But 
they tend to reduce politics to the rational choice of the individual, 
solitary voter.  The means is seemingly very democratic, but the end 
can _become_ bourgeois-liberal, as you'd say, in the worst sort of 
way.  Think of the primary system: it's arguably become a disaster.
I'm not saying that Progressive reforms are uniformly 'bad', I'm just 
identifying a problem or a tension that has to be taken seriously.

As a secondary matter, perhaps you should be 'taking up the banner' 
of rank-choice ('Individual Runoff Voting') voting rather than 
worrying so much about the electoral college.  It's my understanding 
that this may actually be workable under the Constitution, whereas the 
abolition of the EC would require an amendment.  It's an uncommonly 
good idea, I think.  You vote for your first choice, second choice, 
and so on.  You can make, in short, Gore your second choice and Nader 
your first; if nobody gets a majority of the votes, the second choices 
are factored in.  In this way, Gore would've won.

TTYL.

A Call to Arms across Middlesex County. . . 

Business and community leaders will meet to bring
accountable government back to Middlesex County 


Nov, 27, 2000 at 6:30 PM, East Brunswick Library


NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ -- Hardly a day goes by that some
credible individual or organization does not report on
the reckless disregard and wasteful spending of the
Middlesex County government. Having personal knowledge
of the corruption and collusion behind the Roosevelt
Care Center privatization fiasco, we are deeply
concerned that a band of incompetent and irresponsible
persons under the guise of government leadership can
operate arrogantly and defiantly -- not as proper
government representatives -- rather using the power
of government office in protection of their
self-interests. As an agent of the Federal government
once advised, Federal agents can not arrest County
officials for obvious stupidity. Perhaps not. However,
as taxpayers, we do have an absolute right to expect
responsible government accountable to its people. 

Everyone -- yes, its time to admit it, everyone -- in
the state of NJ is well aware of this County's
political stronghold. And it exercises improper and
undue influence on persons, media and businesses that
paralyzes constituents with fear, forever demanding
their loyalty, if they are to retain the County
government's favor, tax breaks, jobs, revenue or
contracts that the freeholders have selectively
awarded them. 

Enough. Middlesex County government is an atrocity and
begs to be brought down with accountability. It needs
to be investigated, its books audited, its conflicts
of interests exposed and a light of truth shined
behind its closed doors. We must undercover its
well-kept secrets that enriches its special interests
and impoverishes the rights and needs of every County
man, woman and child who has the audacity not to
contribute to the freeholders' Democratic Party
campaigns. 

We are asking -- indeed, we are expecting -- we are
believing -- that all companies and all persons who
have serious and valid concerns with the Middlesex
County Freeholders or Improvement Authority
commissioners will come together on November 27,
6:30PM at the East Brunswick Library and discuss
strategies on how we will legally hold these so-called
government leaders professionally and personally
accountable for their egregious acts. This "Call to
Arms" -- formidable representatives of business and
community interests -- will join hands and their
commitment to rid themselves of bad government. By
finally speaking out in protection of the common good,
we will symbolically empower people to stop sheepishly
dismissing what we have long known the County
government capable of doing. Bad government in
Middlesex County is no longer a laughing matter beyond
the taxpayers' ability to control. We can and will
restore good government to Middlesex County. 

All businesses or individuals committed to joining the
Middlesex County Call to Arms initiative, please

Breaking the Myths of Flexible Work 


A Study Conducted by the Contingent Workers Project 

Report Prepared by Alice de Wolff 



The realities facing Toronto workers in the "new global economy" are laid bare in this startling new study by the Contingent Workers Project. 

Breaking the Myths of Flexible Work provides a timely picture of the concerns of temporary, contract, part time and self employed workers across all occupations and industries. Approximately half the country*s workers are in non-permanent jobs. Sixty percent of the new "jobs" created in the last decade were contract self employment. In Toronto, many of the city*s newer immigrants are channeled into temporary work or low waged contracting, and this appears to be central to the ethno-racial polarization of income in the city. 

Breaking the Myths involved over 200 contingent workers. Flexible jobs are not meeting the needs of workers who participated in the study. A large proportion of contingent work is low waged, These workers have to carry more costs than people in permanent jobs. Most study participants did not receive sick leave, vacations, insurance, training or pensions from their employers. These workers, among the lowest income earners in the city, are taking the brunt of government and employer actions to "download" costs. Because they do not have full time jobs, many are not eligible for Employment Insurance and are not covered by Workers Safety Insurance. They are more likely to be hurt on the job; and the impact of irregular scheduling on workers* stress, health and caring responsibilities is significant. The study participants needed good information about their rights as workers, but more importantly, they wanted full time permanent work and collective action to promote fair working conditions.

Message:

WASHINGTON, DC--Denouncing the American electoral process as "immoral and 
corrupt," President Clinton announced Tuesday that he will not step down on 
Jan. 20, 2001, declaring himself "President For Life."

Proclaiming Nov. 14 a new national holiday as "Day One of Americlintonian 
Year Zero," Clinton issued a directive of total martial law over "all 
territories formerly known as these United States, from now on to be called 
the Holy United Imperial Americlintonian Demopublic (HUIAD)." He added that 
all election results are "hereby invalidated under Demopublican provisional 
law."

"The American people have spoken," Clinton said. "By failing to generate a 
51 percent majority for either candidate, they have shown their inability 
to muster the drive to collective action. The time has come for a new 
America, a strong Americlintonian Empire, capable of providing the 
indecisive electorate with direction through one man's sheer force of will."

Dressed in full military regalia and flanked by members of his elite 
Demopublican Guard, Clinton told reporters, "Let all peoples of the land 
know this: The era of bipartisan inaction and paralysis has ended. The Age 
of the Great Cleansing Fire begins today."

A significant portion of the U.S. Armed Forces has sworn loyalty to the 
Imperial Demopublic Council of Generals, the new military wing of the 
Clinton regime. But despite such support, many political observers question 
the constitutionality of Clinton's actions, which include the burning of 
the Constitution, the dissolution of Congress, and the establishment of 
"re-education camps" in suburban D.C.

At a sparsely attended press conference, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno 
raised the prospect of a Justice Department investigation of "possible 
illegal activities" on the part of Clinton. Most observers, however, 
believe that such a probe is unlikely: Less than an hour after Reno spoke, 
her battered and broken body was publicly fed to Clinton's dogs.

"Let them bring their pitiful reprisals to the impotent courts. Their 
lawyers and lawsuits shall face the wrath of a people united by the 
almighty fist," said Clinton, whose divinity as HUIAD's first Emperor-God 
was ratified late Tuesday night by the Americlintonic High Priest Council. 
"Let them recount their puny, paper ballots. They shall wither, as will the 
bankers, lawyers, and lobbyists all, before the Holy Cause of 
Americlintonia's glorious, righteous might."

Defiant in the face of objections from the Bush and Gore camps, Clinton has 
consolidated his power over the last several days, ordering armed takeovers 
of major federal buildings and the systematic collection and display of his 
enemies' heads on iron pikes.

In a test of the new regime's power outside the nation's capital, 
Senator-Elect Hillary Clinton, rechristened "Bride of The Lord Clinton On 
Earth," summarily ordered HUIAD troops to fire on Manhattan crowds, leaving 
more than 2,500 dead on Wall Street and quickly dispersing protesters loyal 
to defeated Republican challenger Rick Lazio.

Resistance movements are already forming. The new Legion Of Californians 
has sworn to defeat HUIAD in the west, and anti-Clinton groups have been 
reported across the U.S., including Naderist factions in Washington State 
and Maine.

Clinton has publicly dismissed such insurrections as "pathetic," confident 
that nothing will stem his authority over "the former U.S."

"The rebels are but mewling kittens who shall taste blood instead of milk," 
said Clinton, threatening to deploy HUAID-controlled nuclear weapons 
against members of resistance movements. "The holy power of the atom shall, 
if it must, cleanse this nation of all infidels."

BELGRADE--Serbian president Vojislav Kostunica deployed more than 30,000 
peacekeeping troops to the U.S. Monday, pledging full support to the 
troubled North American nation as it struggles to establish democracy.

"We must do all we can to support free elections in America and allow 
democracy to gain a foothold there," Kostunica said. "The U.S. is a major 
player in the Western Hemisphere and its continued stability is vital to 
Serbian interests in that region."

Kostunica urged Al Gore, the U.S. opposition-party leader who is refusing 
to recognize the nation's Nov. 7 election results, to "let the democratic 
process take its course."

"Mr. Gore needs to acknowledge the will of the people and concede that he 
has lost this election," Kostunica said. "Until America's political figures 
learn to respect the institutions that have been put in place, the nation 
will never be a true democracy."

Serbian forces have been stationed throughout the U.S., with an emphasis on 
certain trouble zones. Among them are Oregon, Florida, and eastern 
Tennessee, where Gore set up headquarters in Bush territory. An additional 
10,000 troops are expected to arrive in the capital city of Washington, 
D.C. by Friday.

Though Kostunica has pledged to work with U.S. leaders, he did not rule out 
the possibility of economic sanctions if the crisis is not resolved soon.

"For democracy to take root and flourish, it must be planted in the rich 
soil of liberty. And the cornerstone of liberty is elections free of 
tampering or corruption," Kostunica said. "Should America prove itself 
incapable of learning this lesson on its own, the international community 
may be forced to take stronger measures."

STOP THIEF!  STOP BUSH!!! STOP THE RIGHT FROM STEALING THE COUNTRY!  
REMEMBER WATERGATE? NOW, FLORIDAGATE!

            The U.S. National Election has  provided a National Crisis. One 
of deeply serious consequences and  a profound demonstration of a new 
alignment of class forces. It is the principal task of revolutionaries now 
to Agitate and Communicate, in order to open further the gates of 
Revolutionary Struggle for Peoples Democracy (Majority Rule) as the next 
stage of struggle for Socialism.
The phrase -mongering of Nader-Green Nadirs exposes the objectively right 
wing stance of the Liberals. Objectively to the Right of  the Democratic 
party, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP, Jesse Jackson, and even 
the Gore sector of the Bourgeoisie.
Jesse Jacksons candidacy, which these same Liberals, did not nearly so 
enthusiastically support was more advanced that the Nadirs,
because by running in the Democratic Primary, Jesse revealed both the 
strength of his constituency, and moved the electorate to the left. Dukakis 
just couldnt draw the voters he needed.

The Nadir-Greens,  by actually opposing the least reactionary sector of the 
bourgeoisie in the election , in the real world,  helped the most 
reactionary candidate and the rightist sector of the bourgeoisie to 
neutralize the peoples vote.  We must challenge the Nadir Green petty 
bourgeois Liberals to explain themselves and their intentions. Either they 
will join with the genuine anti-imperialist democratic movement to put 
together a mass electoral Left Bloc or they should be attacked, isolated 
so that their influence on the petty bourgeoisie and even the working class 
is gradual eliminated.

At this point these are some of the actions Revolutionary Democrats should 
pursue in opposing the Bush attempted Grand Larceny and Coup.

Letters, E-Mail, Faxes, Leaflets, Programs, Direct Communication to:
GORE and Democratic Party, Jesse Jackson, individual Congresspersons urging 
them to take the   election challenge to the hoop. To be unrelenting in 
their opposition to Bush Rip-Off!

elimination of electoral college, one person one vote, (including

Subject:Democracy for export, made in USA
Message:

From Cuba's Daily, Granma:


Democracy for export, made in USA

                   THE U.S. electoral crisis has produced unending amusement 
in Latin
                   America, where millions feel vindicated after many 
decades of U.S.
                   disdain for the so-called the "banana republics."

                   Except for a few exceptions, politicians south of the R�o 
Grande have
                   been hiding their sarcasm after the "technical draw" 
between Republican
                   George Bush and Democrat Al Gore, but the media has not 
ceased to
                   draw attention to the scandal which gives that democracy 
for export the
                   look of a banana republic.

                   A cable from the Spanish press agency EFE highlights some 
of the
                   commentaries from the Latin American press: in the 
Mexican daily
                   Reforma, the columnist Ren� Delgado pointed out that "if 
what had
                   happened in the United States were to happen in Panama, 
the Marines
                   would have already landed, ready to deal with the 
problem."

                   According to Gabriel Guerra Castellanos, another Mexican 
columnist,
                   "the entire world is laughing" at the United States and 
the crisis would be
                   funny if it wasn�t happening in the world�s most powerful 
country.

                   Neri da Silveira, president of the Brazilian electoral 
board, acting as an
                   observer at the U.S. elections, said that the U.S. 
electoral system is
                   "archaic and defective" and allows for fraud. "What 
struck me most was
                   the variety of voting and vote counting practices among 
the states. They
                   still use traditional ballot boxes and other obsolete 
equipment. Their
                   electronic ballot box is the size of a refrigerator."

                   Many have recalled the old refrain about "the only 
country on the
                   continent that has never had a military coup..." and now 
they are adding
                   the question: "Why doesn�t Washington have a U.S. 
embassy?"

                   There has been no lack of jokes about Latin American 
politicians with
                   questionable electoral ethics who have supposedly visited 
Miami to
                   advise its governor, Jeb Bush, brother of the Republican 
candidate.

                   "We Latin Americans would be delighted if an OAS 
delegation were to
                   arrive in the capital of Florida to supervise�naturally 
while trying to
                   keep straight faces�the revision of the U.S. electoral 
procedures,"
                   wrote Ra�l Gangotena in Quito�s El Comercio.

                   According to Panama�s El Universal, if what is currently 
happening in
                   the United States were to happen anywhere else in the 
world, "they
                   would have already set up a commission of observers 
making
                   declarations, sniffing out the vaguest shadow of possible 
fraud,
                   demanding precision, a recount of the votes and 
obligatory second
                   rounds."

                   Cr�tica Libre, another publication from that country, 
reminds us that when the
                   present candidate George Bush�s father was president he 
invaded Panama in
                   1989 to arrest General Manuel A. Noriega.

                   Many U.S. citizens could argue, as one U.S. correspondent 
for EFE did,
                   that the crisis is taking place in the most Hispanic of 
all the states,
                   Florida, with its millions of Latin American residents.

                   On other side of the world, the problem that has arisen 
in the "kingdom
                   of democracy" has not gone unnoticed. From Moscow ANSA 
reports
                   that a group of Russian delegates have offered to act as 
international
                   observers to oversee the U.S. elections.

                   The president of the Foreign Affairs Commission who 
proposed this
                   motion stated that, despite the fact that there is no 
chance of the
                   suggestion being approved by the majority of the Russian 
Duma, the
                   group, which calls itself In Defense of U.S. Democracy, 
have not lost
                   any occasion to ridicule the situation in Florida. After 
having received so
                   many lectures on democracy from Washington, they would be 
delighted
                   to return the favor.

                   While in the most technologically developed country in 
the world the
                   votes were being recounted by hand and the crisis is tied 
up in a legal
                   tangle for which the candidates are still continuing to 
amass revenues,
                   according to AFP one web surfer, frustrated by the 
lengthy process,
                   decided to advertise the presidency on the auction page 
of the website
                   E-bay which hurried to withdraw the advertisement 
entitled, "Become
                   president of the United States: presidency for sale."

                   The price of the presidency, after starting off at the 
value of a mere
                   cent, reached 100 million dollars. The requirements for 
participation in
                   the auction were that the bidder should be at least 35 
years of age, be a
                   U.S. citizen and not have a criminal record. But perhaps 
this is too much
                   to ask.

Consumers fighting back
for the Roosevelt Care Center
        by Patricia Nelson	Contributor: Alex Wiener

Glenda's House is the NJ affiliate of the national non-profit advocacy organization, the Association for Protection of the Elderly, Inc., Lexington, South Carolina.  It speaks out in protection of elder and vulnerable adult rights and works tirelessly with legislators, judges, police, attorneys, interested companies and individuals to promote awareness, sensitivity and actions that stop the exploitation of elder and vulnerable adults.  In addition to its successful Elder Crime Offensive, Glenda's House takes particular interest in exposing criminal practices within the nursing home industry.




October 2000
Edison, New Jersey

 Why Roosevelt failed 	
	
The story behind Roosevelt Care Center continues in its promise to be as intriguing -- as it is bizarre.  And as we await the inevitable decisions that will formalize Roosevelt's long-term care (LTC) future, it is important to reflect on how this once- great healthcare facility was purposefully destroyed by what is now well-known political forces intent on its demise.
Every documented evidence has proven that the Middlesex County freeholders, their Improvement Authority commissioners (MCIA), and key players in Roosevelt's unions and administrative positions worked collusively and independently to bleed Roosevelt for their own purposes, exploiting it for their every need.
Roosevelt's current bleak standing is obvious proof that its intended operation was never about what was best for Roosevelt -- its residents -- or its extraordinary staff that for almost 60 years methodically built Roosevelt's reputation as a premiere NJ healthcare facility.  Rather, since 1994, Roosevelt has served as a political backdrop against which politicians and special interests have borrowed on their perceived credibility in order to promote false hope to County taxpayers that they would keep their LTC facility.  And, as they engaged their usual smoke screens, double-talk and misdirection to dissuade attention from who they were really serving while drafting Roosevelt's plans, these same self-serving people have personally collected on every advantage that Roosevelt would profit for them.
Purposefully bled dry, Roosevelt now offers no real advantages to benefit even the most greedy of special interests.  Except of course, for its land, which is the current prize almost within reach of the Democratic Party's campaign contributors * its commercial building contractors * who are now rabidly salivating for the land sales to come.

 How can we believe the Middlesex County freeholders or MCIA? 	
	
It is also clear that each egregious decision made over the past six years by the Middlesex County freeholders and MCIA commissioners reflected their desperate attempts to dump what they regarded as a dinosaur nursing home in a modern healthcare industry.  The freeholders and commissioners, particularly David Crabiel and Richard Pucci, enjoyed Roosevelt's earliest days, when it served the Democratic Party's purpose.  When Federal government monies were plentiful and fueled the County government's excesses with their overstaffing and poor management of Roosevelt, there was little need for accountability.  Money could be spent in a fiscally irresponsible fashion, allowing the County government to appoint staff and draft contracts for their cronies' services beyond Roosevelt's real needs.  Such appointments appeased the County freeholders' patronage mill, which hungrily demanded favors in return for the campaign contributions they provided. 
 However, as Federal monies dried up, the County increasingly had to subsidize lost insurance reimburse-ments from its own treasury.  And once Roosevelt's annual costs topped $21 million, a business consultant suggested privatizing (selling) Roosevelt for $40 million.  And it was with that financial advice the freeholders forgot their promise to their taxpayers to keep Roosevelt as a County-owned facility and thus they began their path to destroy the Roosevelt Care Center.
Before privatization could occur, Roosevelt had to be trimmed down from the excess financial fat the freeholders had built into it.  Needless jobs had to be eliminated and department services cut-back.  To accomplish these tasks, the freeholders needed a conduit, JFK Hartwyck (JFK), to serve as the slayers for the jobs.
The freeholders gave JFK the go-ahead and the necessary bloodbath ensued.  Although JFK seems to have followed sound business principles for bringing Roosevelt into financial feasibility, the relish with which JFK accomplished their tasks decimated the pride and morale within the facility.  Residents, staff and family members were left numb from JFKs kamikaze management style.  However, even with their success, JFK fell out of favor with the freeholders and once again, the County had to search for another nursing home management company.

Enter Solomon Healthcare

	Despite its well-known and dangerous practices for providing LTC services in Colorado (there was a 40- person class-action suit on record against Solomon for its egregious care when the freeholders were considering Solomon's services), the freeholders nonetheless hired Solomon Healthcare in their desperate attempt to rid themselves of a costly LTC facility. Solomon quickly took advantage of the freeholders' and commissioners' desperation * and their business naivete. They all entered into a 10-year management contract that would eventually be the County's undoing. Solomon soon arrived at Roosevelt, determined to enforce its holocaustic approach to LTC.  Staff, services and equipment were cut-back to bare minimums, exposing residents to potential crimes of abuse, neglect and wrongful deaths.  Havoc ensued * Roosevelt was in turmoil.  One such wrongful death occurred in November 1999 that led to the facility's admissions' closure.  Both residents and staff were under siege, yet the freeholders and MCIA did nothing to help.  Finally, Solomon would no longer tolerate Crabiel's reneging on contract 
payments and a multi-million dollar lawsuit was filed in US District Court.  Eventually, for $8.3 million dollars of Middlesex County taxpayers' money, the lawsuit finally settled * and conveniently for the freeholders * quietly went away.  
	
 The story about Royal 	
	
Coinciding with Solomon's depar-ture, the County government had to have another buyer for Roosevelt if it was to rid itself of its Solomon problem.  But a dilemma ensued, which caused the freeholders' serious concerns.  As it soon developed, no one was interested in buying Roosevelt.  Business leaders who considered the deal later explained that the freeholders' demands for Roosevelt's sale simply made no business sense.  (Ironically, the freeholders had already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars with *pay for players* Ernst & Young and the DeCotiis law firm to draft the sale's language * presumably for professional advice to achieve a successful result?  Not quite.)  However, these problems didn't faze the freeholders who were used to wasting taxpayer money to solve their personal problems (David Crabiel and Richard Pucci were both personally named on the Solomon lawsuit).  Calls were placed to the highest levels of the Democratic Party and a plan was quickly hatched.  If no one wanted to buy Roosevelt, then the County would pay someone to buy Roosevelt -- from them.
Like Solomon, Royal Healthcare also had a well-known and dangerous track record for LTC care.  Again, the freeholders were warned especially by this writer not to hire this substandard health-care provider.  In fact, Pucci, annoyed with this writer's public comments in opposition to Royal, shook his finger at her, praising himself for drafting a *superior deal.*  Subsequently, the freeholders --desperate to rid themselves of Roosevelt *nonetheless proceeded with the Royal fiasco.  
In the months that followed, the realities of Royal's true character and poor management practices became obvious.  Even its association with Michael Konig / Broadway Management, a known Medicaid defrauder who also had two of his other homes closed because of sexual assaults on residents, was not sufficient concern to dissuade the freeholders from turning Roosevelt over to these aberrant healthcare providers.  And despite all fanfare that Royal was Roosevelt's best answer, both the NJ Finance Board and the NJ Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS), also declined to support the Royal deal.  The Board refused approval on the freeholders' needed bonds to finance Royal's services and the NJDHSS refused to license Royal's ownership.
Clearly, Pucci had not drafted the best deal for Roosevelt.  As the advocates proved, the deal was miserably flawed from the start.  Pucci therefore proved he had either no business acumen or he purposefully sold-out Roosevelt's best interests.  We believe Pucci sold Roosevelt out * at the freeholders' behest.  Their third management fiasco behind them, the Middlesex County freeholders now needed yet another management company to delay their decisions for Roosevelt until after November's elections.  After all, they had two boys up for freeholder re-election and they didn't want any Roosevelt decisions to offend anyone's vote.

 How can we believe JFK Hartwyck? 	
	
At a recent meeting of the Roosevelt Family Council, Thomas Lankey of JFK Hartwyck and John McGee of the Hartwyck's parent company, Solaris Health Systems, attempted to persuade Roosevelt's family members of JFKs *wait-and-see* approach for drafting Roosevelt's future.  Ostensibly, JFK has been hired for its short-term nursing home management expertise while it also gathers data to report on the feasibility of continuing Roosevelt as a LTC facility.  According to JFK, several issues are being considered.  Priority attention is on whether Roosevelt's current assets should operate as a facility licensed by the MCIA while managed by another company.  Or, in the alternative, should Roosevelt's existing buildings be demolished, building newer facilities elsewhere.  As this writer also pointed out, should the County simply discontinue operating Roosevelt completely?
John McGee, in a recent letter directed to the Home News, protested JFKs disparagement in the press and cited its exemplary record in its current LTC facilities.  Presently, JFK operates three LTC facilities in the Edison, NJ area.
Every nursing home management company, when faced with their track record for providing LTC services, are quick to point out the unfairness of citing 
what they characterize as *isolated* business and healthcare practices. When compared to providing for the daily needs of diverse * and often needy * populations, such criticism (they claim) is inappropriate.  Although there is merit in their arguments when evaluating minor violations, conditions that result in frequent personnel changes and resident abuse, neglect and wrongful death obviously point to serious quality of care issues and must be evaluated with due crisis.   Lack of standards require consumers to evaluate an LTC provider's professionalism and their ability to protect the civil and constitutional rights of nursing home residents in their care.
	Unfortunately, current law, much like domestic violence of 30 years ago, has not caught up to reality by recognizing that elders and vulnerable adults have the same rights of protection as any other non-institutionalized person. As a consequence, many LTC residents, when victimized by crime, have justice denied.  When LTC persons' rights are violated, nursing home owners, management companies, administrators and directors of nursing, who participate in purposefully providing egregious care conditions, should be arrested, jailed and prosecuted.  Current sanctions infrequently recognize that crimes are committed in homes.  And when they are recognized, crimes are more often dealt with as administrative routine than with the criminal justice they require.
Roosevelt's staff remembers JFKs conduct when it first managed Roosevelt in 1995 and the resulting chaos JFK orchestrated at the County freeholders' behest.  Recently, this writer reviewed JFKs three nursing home files available for public review at the NJDHSS.
It seems clear that if a nursing home management company represents itself to provide professional nursing home services, it should deliver.  I invite anyone considering JFK Hartwyck's LTC services to review these files in Trenton themselves.

 Towing the freeholders' lies 	
	
As one of the advocates who has successfully opposed the privatization of the Roosevelt Care Center, my files are littered with copies of documents that track the Middlesex County freeholders' past conduct and their probable final solution for Roosevelt.
It seems that when the freeholders' Royal Healthcare deal was exposed for all its flaws, the MCIA had finally had enough.  No longer willing to acquiesce to Crabiel's hair-brained schemes, they wanted an end to the Roosevelt fiasco.
The Royal Healthcare deal was a well-engineered scheme that required the unions' and administration's support if it was to succeed.  As we look back on how quickly the Royal deal was approved and vigorously defended by spokespersons from the unions * and even Ron Denti (Roosevelt's administrator) himself -- it was clear that everyone had to agree to the newest version of Roosevelt's privatization if the union was to keep its contract -- and if key administrative players were to keep their jobs.
The parade before the freeholder board's public meeting microphone was pathetic. Each union and administrative representative stood up on cue * at one point, they even desperately prevailed on Denti's secretary to speak * extolling the virtues of Royal Healthcare.  Was it not obvious to everyone they were expected * like circus acts * to perform on demand?
Both Denti and Frank Damiani, Roosevelt's then-operations manager, (never people to confuse concerns for quality healthcare in opposition to those who pay their $100,000 salaries) were clearly counted on to discredit any opposition to the Royal deal.  Denti had demonstrated his PR-on -demand abilities particularly during Solomon's tenure and even today * trying to sell the MCIAs religious revival of good faith management for Roosevelt. Damiani, Royal's then-spokesperson, despite months of publicly discrediting advocates who opposed Royal's obvious bad management, eventually acknowledged the advocates were right -- he left Royal's employ because of his admitted ethical concerns over their practices.  However, Damiani is now back again to manage Roosevelt under the guise of an MCIA employee.  Protests regarding his qualifications as being *best* for the job were typical of the freeholders' smokescreen tactics.  The freeholders just needed anyone available * preferably someone there before -- to keep Roosevelt steady until final solutions could be implemented for the dying facility now in the freeholders' way.

 The case for credibility 	
	
As the Middlesex County freeholders and MCIA commissioners cautiously await the November elections, they are also working silently behind closed doors to orchestrate Roosevelt's demise.  News of Roosevelt's future is hardly discussed in the press.   When the again publicly-humiliated freeholders asked Royal to leave (after only six-months into their MCIA-proudly negotiated contract), the freeholders required a new nursing home management company to help them quietly transition Roosevelt's short-term operations.  Why?  They needed to put Roosevelt in a holding pattern while they got their two cronies, Polos and Pulomena, re-elected to the freeholder board.  Once the elections were behind them, they would move to implement Roosevelt's final solution.  Yet even as all these things are occurring, you would think *for politically sensitive reasons * the commissioners would have demonstrated their lessons learned from their Solomon mistakes.  Unfortunately, they cared less.  For as the Middlesex County taxpayers eventually discovered, the MCIA * again * failed to actively monitor Royal's six-month management.  Each month, the MCIA turned over $2.3 million to Royal -- yet never demanded its accountability.  Royal secretly committed several egregious acts while it managed Roosevelt (Denti and Damiani, who witnessed Royal's unethical practices behind closed doors, said nothing).  And when Royal left in disgrace, it took with them almost $1 million in missed payroll and 90+ day overdue vendor bills.  Is it not obvious to all of us that neither the Middlesex County freeholders nor the MCIA commissioners are good stewards of their taxpayers' money?
And while all these things are going on, Denti is conducting his personal PR campaign to sell Roosevelt's residents, staff and families on the MCIAs newest decision to use JFK Hartwyck.  It doesn't seem to matter who tosses Ron a baton * with which to lead his present parade.  Today, in his newest metamorphosis as an MCIA employee, he is extolling Roosevelt's virtues based on the regulatory management of the NJ Department of Health and Senior Services, the same agency that presently (in October 2000) has Roosevelt closed to admissions because of problematic care.

 The NJ Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS)  is broken 	
	
Denti would like consumers to believe that the NJDHSS is a highly reputable and reliable indicator for regulating NJs nursing homes.  In fact, he often cites the NJDHSS for its failure to substantiate advocates' concerns when they have filed numerous complaints against Roosevelt.  He would like consumers to conclude that since Roosevelt *mostly* passed its recent annual survey, and since most complaints filed against Roosevelt are recorded by the ombudsman and NJDHSS as *unsubstantiated,* there is clearly no reason for consumers to be *fooled*  by advocates whose only interest is *causing trouble* for Roosevelt.
Denti's comments are predictable in advocacy.  The first line of defense against advocates who annoyingly expose the truth * is to attack their credibility.  However, I feel it important to address Denti's smokescreen comments and his unflattering descriptions of the advocates who exposed the real debasement of the Solomon/Royal deals.  It would seem clear that any persons who could convince formidable agencies like the NJ Finance Board and the NJDHSS not to support a deeply entrenched Democratic Party County government's proposals * such advocates must have a respectable lobbying skill.  Add to this Wall Street's need to place Middlesex County's bonds on a negative rating watch because of their Royal financial fiasco * it would seem clear that the advocates are a credible adversary.
Unfortunately, considering the NJ ombudsman's and NJDHSSs qualifications and reliability for protecting the rights of institutionalized elders (well documented by Federal investigative agencies), the advocates are quick to assert that were it not for their advocacy, Royal Healthcare (despite its egregious LTC practices) would likely have been approved for Roosevelt's ownership.
Throughout the US, there is mounting concern for the quality of care found in 25% of our nation's nursing homes.  According to the US Government Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the Federal government, their March 1999 investigation of thousands of nursing homes over ten states conclusively proved that too many nursing homes have dangerous care standards. And their practices caused serious injury and needless death of residents.  (In NJ, this percentage would identify over 90 nursing homes housing 14,000 people daily.)
Coinciding with these reports (and numerous others done by the US Office of the Inspector General, the US Health Care Finance Administration, and the US Committee on Aging) Federal departments are also recognizing that each state's oversight agencies (in NJ, that includes the ombudsman and NJDHSS) are not meeting the standards of proper regulatory practices -- thus victimizing elders to egregious care practices.
As a researcher and writer, I often have opportunity to review nursing home files located at the NJDHSS in Trenton, NJ.  Having examined numerous files, tracking the dates a complaint is recorded, investigated and documented, I can attest that the quality of these files are problematic at best.  First, there is never consistency in the documents enclosed in each file.  Some files are missing important documents.  In nursing homes in which I know a complaint has been filed, I nonetheless find no information.  Documents signed for accuracy are missing important data.  Any researcher must therefore conclude from the condition of these files that many can not be considered accurate or complete.  
In examining complaints, the disparity in dates between the time a complaint is filed and when it is *investigated* is usually days, weeks * even months -- apart.  In cases when crimes of abuse or neglect are committed, clearly crime scenes thus have ample time to be cleaned, leaving the *investigator* with nothing to review * hence, yielding an *unsubstantiated* complaint.
These typical file conditions were just as compelling when I reviewed Roosevelt's files and the 38 complaints found in its folder.  Remarkably, of the 38 complaints filed, only two were substantiated.  (Outrageously, Roosevelt's media-circus exposure of Solomon's diaper debacle was a complaint also found *unsubstantiated* by the NJDHSS.  The reason?  Upon examination of the complaint, this writer determined that the investigator investigated * yes * the wrong zone.)  Both the outrageous quality and occurrence of these so-called  *investigations* can not help but conclude complaints as *unsubstantiated,* especially for Denti's and Damiani's alleged violation of the Code of Federal Regulations on June 19, 2000.
Roosevelt's Family Council held its first meeting on June 19.  Per its rights by Federal law, it declined to invite Roosevelt's administration, consisting of Denti and Damiani, then under Royal's watch.  Apparently, their then-boss, Surbhi Tarkas, was manic in her need to infiltrate the Family Council meeting.  Despite heated protests directed at both that they were violating CFR483.15 and were repeatedly asked to leave, both Denti and Damiani persisted in remaining.  Finally they left, but Denti proceeded to interrupt the meeting twice more.
Complaints were filed with the NJDHSS and its administrators' board for each man's alleged violations of Federal law.  After investigation, which solely consisted of the investigator asking Denti and Damiani if they were invited to the meeting (to which they obviously said *yes*) the investigation was concluded and the complaint found *unsubstantiated.*  What???
Outrageously, the NJDHSS failed to seek out over 30 family members  present at the meeting who witnessed Denti's and Damiani's bullying tactics and this writer's repeated advisement of their violations of Federal law.  Clearly, the NJDHSS failed in its mandated duty to properly, completely and credibly -- investigate this complaint.
If regular police investigations followed practices similar to the NJDHSSs complaints, crime scenes would never yield clues to convict accused criminals, there would be insufficient evidence for arrests, and few persons would ever be held accountable for their egregious acts.  I doubt that such conditions would ever be tolerated if corporate assets were involved.  Yet these insane investigatory practices are conducted daily in NJs nursing home complaint investigations (because elders do not have significant economic impact). Thus, any NJDHSS complaint investigation is problematic at best and likely can not be relied on for accuracy.  The most that present complaint documentation can serve is to point to the probability of bad care in homes * and in the rare instances that fines are assessed, consumers must wait years for fines to be collected, if at all.
Therefore, consumers can not be persuaded by Denti's positive assertions over the NJDHSSs findings.  We have seen the quality of care conditions that have existed in this facility when operated by egregious healthcare companies Solomon and Royal.  We have all witnessed the short-staffing.  We have sadly watched the forced departure of many faithful and long-time Roosevelt employees. We have wretched on the quality and choice of food served to Roosevelt's residents.  We have seen how depraved indifference * on the part of numerous *officials* surrounding Roosevelt -- has systematically destroyed a once-great healthcare facility.  Knowing Roosevelt's past as we do, we simply can not tolerate Denti's pathetic attempts to characterize Roosevelt's past or current operations as a testament to *management's* caring and supportive environment.  Roosevelt's residents, family members and staff are very intelligent people and they recognize that the County government and its administrator lackeys have persistently done a self-serving * and very bad job * in operating Roosevelt.

 The land for the two licenses 	
	
In a recent Home News article, the Middlesex County freeholders were given opportunity to grade their performance for managing the Roosevelt Care Center.  They gave themselves a *C.*  Considering the enormous pain and suffering the freeholders caused hundreds of lives (which was totally avoidable had they taken their responsibility to Roosevelt seriously) the opposing advocates would not even give them an *F.*  Actually, we would not even give them a gold star for coloring within the lines.
Considering that the freeholders had full knowledge of the dangerous backgrounds of the healthcare providers they recklessly hired, it is outrageous that they would reflect on their Roosevelt performance in such an infantile fashion.  During JFKs, Solomon's and Royal's tenure, chaotic and egregious care con-ditions contributed to the environments that led to the abuse, neglect and wrongful death of several residents and purposefully damaged the lives of many staff.
However, as always with the Middlesex County freeholders, Roosevelt was never about the quality of patient care or its promises to its staff.  It was about positioning Roosevelt's valuable property out of the hands of healthcare -- and into the hands of Democratic Party campaign contributors anxious to develop Roosevelt's land.
As we have already discussed in this newsletter, Roosevelt is presently in a holding pattern until after November's elections.  The Middlesex County freeholders felt (that for political reasons) a delay in Roosevelt's decisions was necessary before announcing Roosevelt's final solution.
Let's not pretend that JFK is presently evaluating the facility.  Their presence simply serves the freeholders' delay * providing *justification* and *due diligence* in pursuing Roosevelt's final solution.  We know that JFK did not enter its current agreement without purpose.  It, too, has its own agenda.  With news of Royal's departure, JFK wished to explore the ownership of  Roosevelt's licenses.  Coincidentally, JFK also wants to build LTC facilities.  However, since certificate of needs, necessary for building any LTC facility in NJ have not been issued for several years by the state, JFK had to locate existing licenses if it was to realize its plans to build new facilities.
The Middlesex County freeholders have publicly and repeatedly announced that they don't want to be in the LTC business.  And as their actions proved, they desperately tried to rid themselves of Roosevelt when they concocted their foolhardy Solomon and Royal deals. As plans to privatize Roosevelt eventually fell through when the freeholders' foolhardy schemes were exposed, the Democratic Party's plan to position Roosevelt's land began to take on more urgency.  In January 2000, the Middlesex County freeholders made a quiet change in Roosevelt's property deed.  When once it was stipulated by deed that Roosevelt forever remain a healthcare facility, the new changes made in the d

"Politics Explained"

A little boy goes to his dad and asks, "What is politics?"

Dad says, "Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the
breadwinner of the family, so let's call me capitalism. Your Mom,
she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the
Government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you
the people. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your
baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and
see if that makes sense,"

So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said.
Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to
check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper.
So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother
sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room.
Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father
in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, 
the little boy says to his father, "Dad, I think I
Understand the concept of politics now." The father says, "Good son,
tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about." The
little boy replies, "Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working
Class, the Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored
and the Future is in deep shit."

Since the Electoral College is almost historically _meaningless_, I

just is.  It only becomes an issue of value when the question is posed

As for your question --

At this point, it is anyone's guess who is coming.  I have seen a lot of
interest from diverse people, backgrounds and organizations.  I can only
emphasize to all who are thinking of attending -- this is not a hidden,
subversive political plot -- no matter how Crabiel wishes to characterize
this effort.  It is my meeting -- and I guarantee that my intention is to
bring people from any background in one room to join together in strength
and commitment to bring accountability to this government -- period.  With
that said, there will be persons from political parties there -- but that
does not mean it impacts as a "political event."

Some folks that I know are coming are some advocacy groups from Highland
Park, the NJ Trust Guild, Republicans, Green Party folks, Roosevelt
advocates, Edison police reps.

I'm really looking forward to a lively meeting.

Monday's letters to the Home News Tribune 


Published in the Home News Tribune 11/27/00
Appointed school boardis failing city students

The role of political patronage in New Brunswick's appointed Board of 
Education is appalling. A clear example is the landlord who felt pressured to 
evict an independent political group once it became public knowledge the 
group was granted free space from him. He said he had to evict them because 
he had to work with the incumbents or suffer the consequences.
If the Board of Education were doing a good job, members would welcome 
outside scrutiny. They could run for office and be elected on their merits. 
The taxpayers would have some say in administering the moneys that are 
available for education. Perhaps we would choose to bring back school bands, 
orchestras, field trips beyond the confines of New Brunswick and salaries 
comparable to those of neighboring districts. The citizens of New Brunswick 
are willing to pay for quality education. Now we get a "tax bargain" with 
bloated supervisory staff. I hope all the people who felt cheated at the 
polls will hold these "re-elected" individuals accountable. Let's demand 
genuine honesty, community control and democracy.

FYI,

Donna Best has a letter to the editor. She is printed as having great hopes 
for NB in the Home News Tribune Poor School Special that ran last year. 
Unfortunately, the City has rode roughshod over the community based 
management team at Woodrow Wilson, as reported in her letter to the editor, 
today ( and in the past by People's Campaign literature.). She sounds as if 
she is as determined as ever. As history has shown, the NB BOE has been able 
to discourage a vast majority of parents from getting involved.

I would print the letter but it doesn't appear on-line.

New Brunswick police director decides it's 'time to move on' 

11/28/00

BY SUE EPSTEIN
STAFF WRITER





















New Brunswick Police Director Michael Beltranena announced his retirement 
yesterday after 27 years with the department, the last seven as the city's 
top cop. 


Beltranena, 49, the department's first Hispanic director, said his last day 
on the job will be Thursday. 


"It's time to move on," he said. "I've been preparing myself for this moment 
for the last several years. It's very difficult, but you know when it's 
time." 


Mayor James Cahill made the formal announcement yesterday from his office, 
flanked by Beltranena and the man who will replace him, Joseph Catanese, who 
has served as deputy director since earlier this year. 


Cahill said Beltranena "has served this city extremely well," citing several 
accomplishments during the director's time in office. 


"There has been a 34 percent drop in overall crime with a drop of nearly 57 
percent in juvenile arrests since 1993," when Beltranena became director, 
Cahill said. 


The department also grew from 122 members in 1993 to 140 officers, many of 
whom have been used in preventive programs in the city's schools, the mayor 
said. 


Cahill also credited Beltranena with establishing a good rapport with city 
residents through bicycle patrols and the creation of an office of police 
community relations. 


Beltranena said the recent conviction of two of his veteran officers for 
operating a brothel in the city played no role in his decision to retire. 


"My decision was actually made before the investigation . . . began," he 
said, referring to Detective James Marshall and Sgt. Marco Chinchilla. The 
two are facing 10-year prison terms when they are sentenced in January. 


Beltranena said he plans to remain in law enforcement in some capacity and is 
considering "several opportunities." He would not elaborate. 


"I want to spend a lot of time with my family and refocus my energies," the 
South Brunswick resident said. 


He said he is proud to have brought more diversity to the department by 
adding more African- American, Hispanic, Asian and female police officers. 


Beltranena joined the force in 1973 and was promoted to captain and chief of 
operations in January 1993. He was given the top job in July 1993 after the 
early retirement of the acting police director, who caused some friction in 
minority communities by deploying a police canine unit on a street-corner 
crowd. 


Catanese, 40, is an 18-year veteran of the department and a life- long New 
Brunswick resident. He holds a law degree from Seton Hall and a master's 
degree in public administration from the John Jay School of Criminal Justice. 


He said he wants to expand the programs Beltranena introduced, including the 
bicycle patrols and training for police officers.

Police director retires after 27 years in service



                                                 By Sally Goldenberg
                                                 Senior Writer


                                                 New Brunswick has seen a 34 percent
drop in crime and nearly a 57 percent drop in
                                                 juvenile arrests since 1993. Since
1990, the city�s police department has diversified its
                                                 staff, increasing the number of Asian
officers from two to three, Black officers from 10
                                                 to 20, Hispanic officers from five to
10 and female officers from one to four. The
                                                 number of officers on the force has
also risen, from 113 in 1991 to 140 presently.

                                                 These changes, along with what many
city officials call an improved partnership
                                                 between the city and its residents,
were overseen by New Brunswick Police Director
                                                 Michael Beltranena, 49, who has
served on the force for the last 27 years. But
                                                 Beltranena has passed the torch to
40-year-old Deputy Director Joseph Catanese,
                                                 Mayor Jim Cahill announced in his
office in City Hall yesterday afternoon.

                                                 �It�s time to move on to the next
chapter in my life,� Beltranena said. �It�s a decision I
                                                 feel is good for New Brunswick, the
New Brunswick Police Department, my family
                                                 and myself.� He added that while the
decision to retire was a difficult one to make, he is
                                                 confident that Catanese will
adequately fulfill his new role.

                                                 �I am very confident that Director
Catanese will live up to the expectations that he has
                                                 set for himself,� Beltranena said.
�I�ve watched his career from the very beginning. He�s
                                                 an excellent police officer. ... I
feel very comfortable retiring and leaving the police
                                                 force in his hands.�

                                                 Beltranena spent his time with the
department in several capacities. He was appointed
                                                 as police sergeant in 1982, police
lieutenant in 1986, police captain in 1993 and director
                                                 of police in July of 1993.

                                                 �I am going to miss it,� he said.
�It�s like leaving home.� Based on New Jersey law as it
                                                 applies to police and fire officials,
Beltranena said a retiree can collect pension after 25
                                                 years of service with no minimum age
requirement, so he will begin collecting his
                                                 pension Dec. 1.

                                                 His future plans entail continuing
work in the field of criminal justice, he said,
                                                 emphasizing that his retirement will
allow him to spend more time with his family.

                                                 In continuing Beltranena�s
aforementioned accomplishments, Catanese said he plans to
                                                 expand on the developing partnership
between the community and the NBPD and the
                                                 Drug Abuse Resistance Education
program, to name a few of his goals.

                                                 �This opportunity means more to me
than anyone can imagine,� he said. �We are
                                                 committed to New Brunswick�s future.�

                                                 Cahill, who appointed Catanese, said
the 18-year veteran of the police department and
                                                 lifelong resident of New Brunswick
has an extensive background in the force. Catanese
                                                 joined the department in 1982, was
promoted to police sergeant in 1988, police
                                                 lieutenant in 1993 and police captain
in 1998. He became deputy director earlier this
                                                 year and will begin his new position
effective Friday.

                                                 Citing his educational
accomplishments, Cahill noted that Catanese is a 1989 University
                                                 alumnus and received a master�s
degree in public administration in 1995 from the John
                                                 Jay School of Criminal Justice and a
juris doctorate from Seton Hall School of Law in
                                                 1999, the same year he was admitted
to the New Jersey Bar Association.

                                                 He added that his retirement is not
related to the recent conviction of two New
                                                 Brunswick police officers, Sgt. Marco
Chinchilla and Detective James Marshall, who
                                                 were found guilty last month of
operating a brothel in the city.

                                                 �The trial played no part in my
decision,� he said. �My decision was made long before
                                                 the trial,� he added, noting that he
began planning for his retirement prior to the
                                                 investigation.

                                                 In response to some residents�
criticism of corruption in the police department � and the
                                                 recent conviction � Beltranena said
the department is far from corrupt. He added that
                                                 during the course of the
investigation for Marshall and Chinchilla, the Middlesex
                                                 County Prosecutor�s Office followed
all leads for the department and found no other
                                                 officers guilty of any charges.

                                                 �That trial would not have occurred
had it not been for the integrity of the New
                                                 Brunswick Police Department,� he
said, noting that it was NBPD officers who
                                                 essentially reported on the illegal
actions of the convicted officers.

Subject:1st Anniversary of Victory in Seattle Commerated By Local Anarchists
Message:

PRESS RELEASE 11/30/2000

In the early morning of November 30th, 2000 we, as anarchists, hung black
banners of negation across the city of New Brunswick, New Jersey.  We also
turned the American flags in front of the courthouse and city hall upside
down. These actions were done, first, as a signal of the distress and dismay
of many people at the brutality, illegal arrests, intimidation, and media
suppression of the large numbers of people who came to Seattle, Washington
on November 30, 1999.  These people were present to publicly demonstrate
their disagreement with the World Trade Organization (WTO), globalization of
economies, attacks against labor and health standards, and capitalism itself
at last year's meeting of the WTO ministry.  These activists succeeded in
shutting down their meeting.  The WTO is an undemocratic organization of
corporations that enforce "free trade" agreements globally.

These flags, which were hung in sympathy and outrage, are also symbols of
anarchist pride and optimism which commemorate the victory of our sisters
and brothers in Seattle.  With these actions a new movement was born - one
which showed the WTO that people will no longer tolerate their oppressive
actions.

Finally, we remember the court cases in Seattle that are still pending, as
well as those cases that have been resolved unjustly.  For these current
injustices we continue to offer our support and solidarity.

Anarchists are a non-violent, compassionate and dedicated group.   If it
were not for the systemic crisis of the emerging nations and the existence
of coercive governments worldwide, we would not have to exist. While we cry
for our own pain and losses sustained in actions which we freely
participated in in order to fight the systems which never fail to put
profits before people, we also perform all of these actions in memory of the
most direct victims of global capitalism.  These people do not choose their
oppression. These include all the people of the developing nations, who are
increasingly abused by sweatshop labor, relocation, destruction of their
environment, as well as all the victims who lost their lives to police
brutality were detained or tortured worldwide over the past year of 2000.

We, as anarchists, will continue to perform our actions boldly, with love
for all humankind and confidence in the righteousness of our beliefs.  So
long as our existence continues to be made necessary by the oppressive and
demeaning presence of capitalism and its violently coercive agents, we will
never cease in our actions.

Judge transfers case of election-day clash 


Published in the Home News Tribune 11/28/00
By J.P. WHITE
STAFF WRITER
NEW BRUNSWICK: Election-day clashes between community activists and city 
workers will not be settled in New Brunswick Municipal Court.

Yesterday, Judge Gerald Gordon said he was transferring the case out of New 
Brunswick because city employees are involved. A new court date and location 
has not been set.

Mayor James M. Cahill's aide Kevin Jones faces charges of harassment and 
assault for punching Joseph Smith in the face on Nov. 7 outside the polling 
station at the Lord Stirling School.

Smith was the coordinator of the Campaign for an Elected School Board, the 
group behind a ballot referendum that could have changed the mayor-appointed 
school board to an elected body.

But Smith faces similar charges by Jones, who contends Smith brought on the 
attack.

Outside the court room yesterday, Smith claimed accusations against him are 
false -- "that I provoked him (Jones) into punching me in the head."

Smith said he confronted Jones outside the Lord Stirling School polling 
station after he saw Jones wearing an illegal ribbon that called for 
residents to vote "No" on the school-ballot question.

Jones refused to talk about the incident until it is resolved. Jones' 
attorney, Anthony Vignuolo of Borrus Golden and Foley in North Brunswick, 
also would not comment yesterday.

"I'm broke," said Smith, who is a full-time student at Rutgers and plans to 
raise money for his defense through a benefit party rather than use a public 
defender.

Smith also faces charges of assault and criminal mischief, pressed by William 
Pfeifer, who works for the city water department and is the union president 
of the Municipal Employees Association.

Pfeifer, who didn't return telephone calls yesterday, accuses Smith of 
throwing eggs at a pickup truck driven by campaign workers for the council 
incumbents.

Smith, who denies throwing anything, said the truck was used by campaign 
workers who were driving around the city tearing down opposition signs before 
the election.

On Nov. 7, New Brunswick voters defeated a public question for the fourth 
time that would have shifted the power of school-board selection from the 
mayor to the voters.

Smith said despite the voting results, the numbers -- 3,774 to 2,758 -- show 
the biggest number of "yes" votes since the question first made it to the 
ballot in 1993.

"But we were still defeated by a well-organized city machine," he said.

In support of a mayor-appointed school board, the Committee to Keep Politics 
Out of Schools raised upward of $25,000 with corporate funding -- far more 
than the amount members of the Campaign for an Elected School Board could 
contribute from their own paychecks, Smith said.

Smith's brother Cliff Smith has also found legal trouble as a political 
activist and will face assault charges tomorrow in New Brunswick Municipal 
Court.

High School Principal Pierre Embrey filed a complaint against Cliff Smith 
after the two engaged in an argument across the street from the high school 
Sept. 20, where Cliff Smith said he was distributing literature to students 
when Embrey told him to leave.

"He got pretty hot with me -- up in my face," said Smith, who thinks Embrey 
was even more upset over what appeared to be a bomb threat at the school.

Smith said he left the scene only to receive a court notice two weeks later 
charging him with verbally abusing, assaulting, and physically impeding 
Embrey's pathway.

"I think they (city and school officials) were trying to intimidate us and 
discredit our campaign on the eve of the election," he said.

For the three available council seats, independent challengers Keith Joseph, 
Diego Morales and Curtis L. Warren -- who were supported by Smith's 
organization -- were defeated by Democratic council incumbents Joseph Schrum, 
Jimmie L. Cook Jr. and Robert Recine.

In the wake of the election, the Smith brothers have formed a new activist 
group called the Student/Worker Organization for Revolutionary Democracy and 
will hold a benefit party for campaign legal defense at 6 p.m. Saturday at 
218 George St.

I agree.  Instead, let's have some more of those Amiri Baraka polemicals,
preferably the ones that demonstrate a superb grasp of the dialectic.
Personally, I'd like to further explore the link between G.W. Bush and
fascism, a topic which hasn't been addressed enough in this forum, I don't
think.

Re:  First Democratic Municipal Elections in Kosovo
(This is 4-5 pages when printed out)

Hello Everyone,

Due to the constant "time constraints" that I seem to always live under
these 
days, I am sending this report out to all my friends at one time.  I 
apologize if it offends you to receive this somewhat generic letter - but 
please don't be offended!  You are one of my dear friends whom I felt would

like to hear about our latest mission - and this is the fastest means to 
report to all of you in a timely manner.

At the end of this report is information concerning our January Annual
World 
Citizen Diplomats Weekend Gathering planned for January 13th & 14th. 
Please 
be sure to respond as soon as possible if you plan to attend.

As you saw by the topic of my letter, I arrived home recently from my first

mission to Kosovo.  It was a remarkable and rewarding experience for me 
personally - and a very historic, successful and important mission for the 
citizens of this war-torn region!

This was my third opportunity to serve as an International Election 
Supervisor in the Balkins. Most of you probably remember when I went to
Nova 
Grad, a small suburb of Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Sept., 1997 to
help 
with the first democratic municipal elections following the war against the

ravages of the Serbian leader, Slobadon Milosovic.  I returned two months 
later to supervise the Parliament Elections, this time in Vogosca, another 
suburb of Sarajevo, where all the women and children survivors of the 
Srebrenica massacre now live.  Needless to say, I have seen the horror of
war 
in the eyes of the survivors and heard many terrifying stories of how 
horrible this war was!  As difficult as it is to see and hear from those
who 
have survived, it is so important to them to be able to tell their stories
to 
those of us who will listen - hoping the rest of the world will understand 
how much they have suffered.  Many of them responded in disbelief when we 
explained that all of us here in the United States watched our televisions
in 
horror and we cried for them when we saw what they were going through!  It 
really made a difference to them to know we were aware of their pain and we

were praying for their suffering to end.  They thought they were alone in 
their struggle against the aggressors of the war until they realized the 
whole world was crying with them, and we were all doing whatever we could
to 
help bring it to an end.  

On October 20th we left from Newark airport via Germany to Skopje,
Macedonia. 
 Barbara Wolf, the newest Board Member of World Citizen Diplomats who lives

in Rochester, New York, traveled with me.  Both of us were selected by the
US 
State Department to represent the American people as International Election

Supervisors.  When we arrived in Skopje we were met by the officials of the

OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe).  This 
organization has been running elections in developing nations throughout 
Europe for the past decade.  We boarded the chartered buses waiting there
at 
the airport, and traveled south for four hours through the entire country
of 
Macedonia - to Lake Orhud on the southern boarder.  We were two of about
1000 
International Supervisors processed.  One Hundred and thirty of us were
from 
the USA.  There were 90 Germans, 90 Czechs, 100 from the UK and the rest 
represented another 20 countries.  We were all housed in two lovely resort 
hotels on the shore of Lake Orhud, overlooking this crystal clear lake and 
the mountains of Albania on the opposite shore! 

We remained here for four days receiving our training before embarking for 
Kosovo.  We were inundated with piles and piles of paperwork - hundreds
more 
sheets than we could possibly read in the entire eleven days we were
abroad!  
The training was intense and important - much too important to be crammed 
into just 3 days of actual training!  Our instructors had to move so
quickly 
to get all the information covered in time that we didn't even have time to

scribble notes as they talked!  This was the biggest complaint everyone
had.  
Thank goodness I had already participated in two previous elections.  But 
even with that knowledge I was a little worried that I wouldn't remember 
everything - because the OSCE has made many changes over the past three 
years.  I really felt sorry for those who were new to running elections 
abroad, and I knew there was no way they would ever be able to remember 
everything.  But at least we had everything with us in writing, and
hopefully 
we would be able to find the answers when needed!

Yes, we were under heavy guard, but because we were so far south in
Macedonia 
we felt very safe.  They had scores of undercover police all over inside
and 
outside our hotels - plus the military in uniform.  The last day we were 
there they allowed us to take taxis and travel around the area sightseeing.
 
Barbara and I took a taxi an hour south to the monastery where the Cyrillic

alphabet was first developed. 

At 5am on Oct. 25th we boarded the first of about 30 buses (6 left at a
time) 
and we headed north to tackle the Kosovo border crossing. Since the border 
guards were well aware that our international delegation was coming - the 
crossing went very smoothly.  However, we passed miles of buses and cars 
lined up to cross from both sides, and I bet it took more than a day for
them 
to cross over!  It was a real "eye opener" as we passed the "sand-bag"
types 
of battle stations along the way, and many war tanks and trucks.  We had a 
military escort from Skopje on - and after a day or so we became accustomed

to the constant military presence and escorts almost everywhere we went.

Barbara and I were sent to the Rahovec Region of Kosovo, located a little 
north west of Prizren and a little south east of Peje (Pec). About 100 of
us 
were sent to the Rahovec region - half Americans and half Czechs.  This is 
the German military sector, which is staffed with German KFOR (Kosovo
Forces) 
troops.  There was also a Russian contingent there.

Barbara was assigned to a polling station in Mlecane, a town in the
northern 
part of the municipality of Malisheve.  She worked with an international 
supervisor from the Czech Republic, who was given a polling station in the 
same school.  

I was assigned to the Mihail Grameno Primary School in the town of Rahovec,

where I was appointed the facilitator of this school.  I was in charge of 6

polling stations, all housed in 6 classrooms on the first floor of the 
school.  We had 4386 voters registered to vote at this center,
approximately 
700 for each station.  Each polling station was assigned one Int'l 
Supervisor.  Irene Ratner and I were the two American Supers - Eva 
Turacekova, Pavel Vavrina and Jan Trnka were the three Czech Supers - and 
Araceli Salto was our Supervisor from Spain.

Each of the 1000+ supervisors sent into Kozovo were assigned a translator, 
most of them young residents of the region we were assigned to.  Almost
every 
translator was between 18-25 years old.

We were also assigned a private driver and his car for three days - the day

before the election -- the day of the election - and the day after the 
election.  My translator was 22-year-old Ilir Kadiri.  My driver was 
47-year-old Wahid Spahia.  Wahid has six children, ages 13-22.  His wife, 
Nexhmije, is 45.  She is very ill, suffering from trauma, stress and fear 
from the war.  She is afraid to come out of her house, and she has many 
breathing problems that developed from being so scared.  She might not live

much longer.  In other words, she may be a victim who was literally "scared

to death!" It is so horrible!  Every family in Kosovo has experienced 
personal trauma from the war!  It seemed each story we heard was worse than

the one before!

The polling stations were scheduled to be open 12 hours, from 7am to 7pm. 
We 
got up at 3:30am, left our living quarters by 4:30 and picked up all the 
"sensitive materials" such as the ballots, etc, at the OSCE office.  We
were 
at our school by 5:30am.  The principal of the school arrived at 5:45 to
let 
us in.  We had already met our committee the day before, and already had
our 
polling stations set-up for the election.  From 6-7 we finished putting the

room in order to greet our first voters.  Each polling station had six 
committee members who were local citizens assigned to us.  We Int'l 
Supervisors explained to our committees that we were there only as helpers 
and observers, and we stressed we were not there to run the election.  We 
wanted them to know this was "their" election and we were only there to
help 
when needed. 

However, none of us had any idea what we were about to face!  At both 
previous elections in Bosnia I had a tiny station in a small town, and it
was 
a fairly easy assignment.  Nothing and No-one had prepared me for the next
24 
hours!

When we opened the school door at 7am there were already about a hundred 
people waiting outside.  We started lines outside each of the six
classrooms 
-  until there wasn't room in the hall for one more person.  By 8am we had
to 
close the outside door to the school and only allow people in after some
left 
the building.  This was the beginning of a very long day!

By noon we had 300-400 people outside the building - and every spot of the 
hall full inside.  Because they were overflowing into the street in front
of 
the school, we had to move everyone around back to the playground area.  We

had three types of police and military at our disposal.  The Kosovo local 
police and the U.N. civil police were the two forces who worked directly
with 
us all day.  Because of all the hundreds of people to control, I had about
12 
Kosovo and UN police helping me the entire day.

But by 4pm the crowd outside started to push harder and harder on the
school 
doors from the playground - which was wall to wall small panes of glass. 
We 
could see their faces being squeezed against the panes of glass, and
because 
the school was old I realized that the entire wall of doors could be pushed

in, which would cause many to be stampeeded and possibly crushed to death. 

We had a very dangerous situation and no matter how hard our twelve
policemen 
tried, they couldn't control the crowd or get them to back away from the 
glass doors.  

At 5:00 I finally had to resort to calling in the KFOR Troops.  We were 
instructed only to call the KFOR Troops in if we had a life-and-death 
situation - which we definitely had!

So in rolled two huge tanks with six-foot soldiers dressed in their
military 
camouflage uniforms carrying 3 to 4-foot-long automatic weapons in hand!  
Talk about a powerful presence!!  Within 15 minutes they had the hundreds
of 
people away from the building and lined up in a long, winding, "orderly" 
line.  Thank God!  We could have had a real tragedy on our hands.

The reason the people were so anxious to get inside was because they wanted

so much to vote. They knew the polling stations were to close at 7pm.  They

didn't understand that we were instructed to process every person standing
in 
the line - inside and outside the building - at 7pm. I explained this
several 
times to them, but they wanted to get inside so there wouldn't be any way 
they couldn't vote!  Most of the people stood in lines for 3 to 4 hours! 
Old 
people, many of them with visable wounds and amputees - pregnant women -
and 
women holding their infants!  It was really hard to see them waiting for so

long, but there just wasn't much we could do.  At least once every hour I 
would personally walk outside and pluck the oldest people out of the line
and 
escort them inside and put them into a chair until they were processed.

By 6:00 there were still hundreds of people outside the building.  Then Mr.

Kouchner, the OSCE head of the Kosovo Elections appeared on TV in Pristina,

which aired throughout Kosovo.  He told the people he was extending the 
polling hours until "every citizen voted"!  This was great for the citizens

of Kosovo, but a real dilemma for those of us running the stations.  We
still 
had to count every vote before we could go home!

It wouldn't have taken nearly as long as it did to process each voter if
the 
voter registration books had been done properly.  Unfortunately many of the

registration records had been lost in the mail - when OSCE sent the 
registration records to India to have them processed "cheaper"!  And the 
books weren't done in alphabetical order.  Instead they were put together
by 
registration number, but the numbers were about 12-14 digits long - adding
to 
the problem!  Consequently it took sometimes 10-20 minutes per person to 
process many of the voters.  It really was a terrible problem.

We finished processing the voters at 9:30pm that evening, and finally
closed 
our classroom doors so we could begin the closing procedures.  At 2:30 in
the 
morning, as we were counting the last of our ballots, I looked around our 
room and my committee looked absolutely exhausted.  I thought they would
pass 
out.  They were exhausted both mentally and physically!  We finished at
3:15 
am - 24 hours after our day began.  As we left the building we saw Pavel
and 
his committee still in their classroom counting!  He told me the next day 
that he finished at 4am.

After dropping all our materials off at the OSCE office, we headed back to 
our rooms.  This was honestly one of the hardest days of my entire life!

But after a long, hot shower and a few hours rest, I felt a whole lot
better. 
 Now that we look back on the election, we realize it was a remarkable 
success.  The moderate LDK party won by a large margin, which was a big 
statement for the Int'l community.  The Kosovo people are more interested
in 
rebuilding their country, improving living conditions, and developing new 
jobs for all the unemployed than they are in fighting with the local Serbs.
 
It is only the fanatical extremists who are still retaliating.  

Most of all - the Kosovo people want their Independence from Serbia.  And
who 
can blame them?  Every Kosovo Albanian family has witnessed unbelievable 
atrocities.  Since the election went so well, and the people voted so 
strongly for Ibrahim Rugova and the LDK party, the Int'l community is now 
forced to consider their desire for Independence.

Noon the following day we had our debriefing session, and we had an 
opportunity to share with the OSCE officials whom we worked directly with, 
all our concerns and suggestions for future elections - while everything
was 
still clear in our minds.  We witnessed many problems we hope the OSCE will

confront before the next elections.  But on the whole - the elections went 
excellent and the Kosovo citizens have a lot to be proud of from the
results 
of that very important "historic" day in the rebuilding of their lives.

There is absolutely no way for me to express the personal gratification you

receive from serving as a crucial part of such an historic event!  Every
one 
of you should try to serve as an Election Supervisor of a Democratic
Election 
in a developing nation.  It will most likely be one of the highlights of
your 
life!

I now realize that World Citizen Diplomats has chosen the correct direction

for our future.  Last summer we made the final decision following ten years

of traveling around the world dialoguing with all of you - that we see a 
definite need for a "Citizen Diplomacy Training Center".  We are now in the

process of applying for the funding we need to develop this training
center.  
We wish to offer a one week training to those of you who wish to apply to
the 
OSCE or the United Nations Volunteer Agencies who send people abroad to
serve 
as supervisors and observers of democratic elections. This one week of 
training will provide the attendee with an International
Supervisor/Observer 
Certification.  If you choose to attend a second week you will receive a
week 
of training in conflict resolution and mediation, certifying you as a 
"Citizen Diplomat Peacemaker".  

We plan to send these qualified peacemakers abroad into nations
experiencing 
the very first signs of a possible conflict brewing within.  These Citizen 
Diplomat Peacemakers will become part of an International delegation who
will 
go into hot spots around the world and help defuse internal problems before

they escalate into a war! They will live with the local families and 
eventually all the families will come together and begin dialogue regarding

the issues causing dissention. This is our idea of how humanity can
eliminate 
war before it starts.

Please drop us a note and let us know what you think about our plans.  

Two Fridays ago I received a telephone call from Hamburg, Germany.  It was 
Uli Fiddler.  Uli showed up at 7am at the door of our polling center the 
morning of the elections with his four-man filming crew and asked
permission 
to document the Kosovo elections.  He chose our town because we were part
of 
the German KFOR sector.  I was so thrilled that he called me because I had 
completely forgotten to get his name or telephone number until the next day
-  
and then it was too late to find him.  He and his filming crew documented
our 
entire day of elections.  Thank goodness he had taken my business card the 
day of the elections when he interviewed me.  He called to say that he
wanted 
to send a copy of the footage, and needed to know the kind of video we have

here.  I told him VHS, and he said he would send it right away.

Last Saturday I received the two video tapes, and I couldn't put them into 
the VCR fast enough - only to find out they are the wrong speed and format!
 
Yesterday I called a few video stores here on the shore and found two who
do 
foreign conversions.  But they cost quite a bit to convert (over $100), so
I 
will wait until the first of the year to have it done.  I intend to show
some 
of the footage at our January Annual WCD meeting on Saturday, Jan. 13th.  

I hope those of you who can afford to travel to Princeton that weekend will

come and spend the weekend with us.  We are planning a two-day gathering
the 
weekend of Jan. 13-14th, and everyone who attends will have an opportunity
to 
share with us what you have been doing the past two or three years. We will

find host families to accommodate you, if you can get here.  Barbara Wolf 
will report on her experiences in Kosovo, and her trip coming up soon to 
Japan.  Margaret Fikioris, Bruce Nichols and Barbara are attending the
Peace 
ceremonies in Hiroshima on Dec. 11-12, and all three will share their 
experience at our meeting.  Bruce just arrived home from his trip to The 
Univ. for Peace in Costa Rica where they had a celebration and dedication
of 
a statue of Peace Pilgrim.  Bruce will share this trip to Costa Rica, plus
he 
has some excellent slides of his trip he made with his father recently to 
Cuba.  I haven't had a chance to talk with Dietrich Fischer yet, but I am 
hoping he will be able to share some of his many experiences this past year

also.

I am trying to get the Kosovo coordinators from Quality Support, Inc. to 
attend and speak to all of us about the selection of International 
Supervisors and Observers.  I am also trying to get a representative of the

UN Volunteer Office to attend and share with us how we can become a UN 
volunteer abroad.

I am hoping we will be able to hold our meeting at the Woodrow Wilson
School 
at Princeton University, so we can open it up to the students who might be 
interested in attending.  I will send you all the details about the meeting

sometime in December.  

If you have any ideas of other things we should include that weekend,
please 
let me know so we can try to add it to our agenda.

I believe it is time for me to close for now, and I wish all of you a Happy

Holiday Season.  Please let me know if you can work it out to come to 
Princeton on Jan. 13th and 14th and participate in our Annual Meeting.

Warm Regards in Peace and Friendship,

Lois Nicolai

Dear Matthew,

   It is just a pleasure to hear from you again after all this time.  
I'm sorry for the delay in my response, as Sylvia and I took our 
yearly constitution at the Swiss spa for the month of November, and I 
only received your package upon returning.

   How have you been old chap?  I'm sorry to hear about your sister 
Agnes's case of consumption.  It is terrible when God takes his 
children so soon.  

   You mentioned scarcely anything about those darling boys of yours!
How is Roger?  Has Nigel finally gotten over his bout of bedwetting?  
The boy still getting a bit of hazing for that at boarding school? 
Tell the young fellow not to worry.  It will clear up.  He's only 16 
after all.

   Well now, I am sorry to make this correspondence so short, but I 
must put Jules to bed now.  You should see his insect collection. 
My!  How it has grown.  To wit, he just found the most titilating 
specimen the other day while fetching biscuits from the larder.  

   But I'll derogate you no further.  Farewell ol' boy!

                      Your most humble and beloved servant
                      in God, Church, and Country,
                      James R. Westingshire, IV.

P.S. -- Prate not, and respond soon!  I will not be present next 
month, as I'll be on leave with Uncle Quillard attending to the
estate in New Zealand.

Message:

Developments in the upcoming governor battle.... this is going to be very 
interesting!

December 8, 2000 - NY Times
PUBLIC PROFILE
Firebrand Considers the Post-Whitman Era
By IVER PETERSON

BUSTER SOARIES knows very well that the things he's been saying in his 
sermons and speeches sound raw. Going on about black street gangs and drug 
dealers and wife beaters is a risky thing for someone who is both a Baptist 
minister and, as New Jersey's secretary of state, the highest-ranking black 
person in the administration of Gov. Christie Whitman.

But the Rev. DeForest B. Soaries Jr., or Buster to everyone in the State 
House, is convinced that the time is overdue for an attack on the faults in 
the black community while simultaneously holding the white majority's feet 
to the fires of justice. So there he was at Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton 
recently, jolting about 600 black middle school boys with a dose of reality 
as he sees it:

"If being black means taking drugs and beating on your girlfriend, I don't 
want to be black," he roared as the boys watched, transfixed. "And if being 
white means paying your bills and using proper language and having a nice 
house, call me white!"

Back in his corner office in the State House, Mr. Soaries, 49, says he has 
been misunderstood and called a traitor for working for a white, Republican 
administration. But his habit of blunt speaking has not abated when it comes 
to minority concerns aboutthe racial-profiling scandal that is rocking the 
state. As state officials reluctantly disclosed recently that they had been 
aware of the practice in some form for years, Mr. Soaries stepped forward as 
the only member of the administration to condemn the state police and to 
demand change. Being a lightning rod is not a new experience to him, 
however.

When Mr. Soaries was 19, he was kidnapped and threatened with death by a 
gang of black drug dealers on the Rutgers University campus in New 
Brunswick, where he was a sophomore. The level of drug use among 
African-Americans dismayed him, and he and his growing network of friends 
and contacts had been putting pressure on the police and the university to 
crack down. The experience left him with one big thought.

"I think it cured me of ever falling into the trap that all blacks are good 
and all whites are bad," he said. "It was an inoculation, and it cured me 
from seeing the world in all racial terms."

Mr. Soaries ended his speech at Shiloh on another point, that racism is as 
real as the police officer who stops minority drivers � he himself has been 
pulled over � because of race.

For all the economic progress New Jersey has enjoyed in the seven years Mrs. 
Whitman has been governor, he said, members of minorities "live in a state 
where if you look in your rear-view mirror and it's the police, you're 
nervous if you're black." That problem will be solved, he said, only when 
New Jersey elects its first minority governor. Someone who would protect the 
progress minorities have made, who is not afraid to criticize ills within 
the minority community. Someone like him.

I WANT a minority governor," Mr. Soaries said as he ended his speech at 
Shiloh Baptist. "I want a governor who looks like me!"

The quest for justice has carried Mr. Soaries from a childhood in segregated 
Montclair to the Urban League, to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH 
and then to a doctorate in divinity and his own pulpit at the First Baptist 
Church of Lincoln Gardens, in Somerset. Along the way, he collected the 
names and contacts that help move public policy, and the policy he wants to 
move now is for a different kind of governor.

"My position is that I want a minority governor," he said at a news 
conference at the State House on Wednesday. "This state has a festering 
cancer of racism and sexism in a state agency that cannot be allowed to 
exist." Since none of the candidates he favored had offered to run, he would 
consider it himself.

Isn't making race the test for the next governor a kind of profiling in 
itself? Mr. Soaries, who recently switched from independent to Republican, 
was not biting. "Let's talk math, not race," he said. "If you sell hot dogs 
and you ignore one-third of your market, you're destined to fail."

What the state needs now, Mr. Soaries said, is a governor with better 
instincts on racial issues.

"My position is that it's going to take someone who has a high racial I.Q.," 
he said. "It's going to take someone whose background includes reaching 
people across racial lines, and it's going to take someone who lives in 
close proximity to people in the gap."

"The gap" is one of Mr. Soaries's favorite terms. He uses it to describe the 
space between the rich and the poor, the protected and the persecuted, the 
hopeful and the hopeless. The gap runs from Newark past his window in 
Trenton, on through Camden and into Vineland. Mr. Soaries patrols it every 
weekday from his State House office, every Sunday from his pulpit, and the 
rest of the time at home, where his wife, Donna, cares for their 11-year-old 
twins, Martin and Malcolm.

"The one show they like that creates a challenge to me is the W.W.F.," Mr. 
Soaries said, touching on the fake agony of Vince McMahon's World Wrestling 
Federation. "I've got to personally work on finding some redemptive value in 
the W.W.F., and I believe we may be able to develop a literacy program, 
based on W.W.F. images and personalities." A pause. "I'll have to call Vince 
McMahon about that."

Complex solution



Editorial


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--



To benefit the New Brunswick community, the New Brunswick Development 
Corporation, along with three developers, will transform the upper and lower 
plaza parking lots at New and Neilson streets into a $118 million complex. In 
the past, DevCo. has felt much community backlash for its re-development 
projects, since developments like Liberty Square and Kilmer Square ousted 
local retailers and residents. But this project will be revamping a parking 
lot, and for once, there can be no objection.

The complex — which will include about 750 apartments, 1,600 parking spaces 
and 32,000 square feet of retail stores — will be built in two phases to 
minimize parking disruptions within the city.

These disruptions, although they may handicap the city for a short period of 
time, will help the community economically in the long run. The retail space 
will include a food store, a dry cleaner and a video store, to revitalize the 
downtown area.

The construction is scheduled to begin next spring on a $43 million complex, 
surrounded by New, Neilson, Richmond and Burnet streets. Due the flooding of 
Hurricane Floyd in September 1999, the building will be designed as a 
three-story building erected above one level of enclosed parking. The 
building, when the project is completed, will have 417 residential units, 38 
three-bedroom apartments and 557 parking spaces. 

In addition to the new spaces, the authority may rent parking space at the 
old police station on Route 18 along with shuttle buses to transport workers 
during rush hour.

The building of the complex is ultimately not hurting any New Brunswick 
business and it is not putting anyone out of their homes. It is the most 
socially responsible thing the city has done in the past 20 years because 
they are rebuilding an area that needs rebuilding.

Message:

Justice Scalia has taken it upon himself to remind us that our right to vote 
is not guaranteed... amazing how the system exposes itself...we should

immediately!!!

Justice Scalia's Legal Vision
Is Blinded by His Ambition

Earlier this year, Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court justice who now is all 
but serving as the attorney for George W. Bush, let it be known that if 
Democrats won the presidency, he'd quit the court.

He would leave because under a Democratic administration, he would have no 
shot at being named chief justice by Al Gore, according to the March issue 
of the Washingtonian magazine.

Now, Scalia has taken charge of the election case for George W. Bush and 
will try to herd the conservatives this morning for the result he apparently 
wants: a Bush presidency, and, perhaps, the job of chief justice when 
William Rehnquist retires in a few years as is expected.

Normally, judges disqualify themselves from cases in which they have a 
personal interest; if the naked ambition to be the court's chief was 
accurately attributed to him, then he has no business deciding this fight.

Scalia, however, could not have been bolder in his advocacy for Bush's 
cause, and, by extension, his own.

During oral arguments two weeks ago, he took shots at the Florida courts, 
which had said the most fundamental right in a democracy is the vote.

No way, Scalia said.

"There is no right of suffrage under Article II," he declared.

In plain English, he said that the citizens have no constitutional right to 
vote for President. His reason is that the Constitution places that power in 
the hands of the state legislatures, although he did not mention that all 50 
state legislatures submit the question to a popular vote. (Some transcripts 
of the Supreme Court session attributed this remark to Rehnquist, but Scalia 
apparently was the actual speaker.)

Over the weekend, he took matters even further.

Scalia wrote that Bush would suffer "irreparable harm" if votes were counted 
"by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his 
election."

You have may seen that moment in "A Few Good Men" when Tom Cruise is 
defending a soldier at a military trial.

"I want the truth!" says Cruise, during cross-examination.

Jack Nicholson looks up at him with contempt.

"You can't handle the truth," snarls Nicholson.

The legality of the votes worries Scalia."Count first and rule upon legality 
afterward is not a recipe for producing election results that have the 
public acceptance democratic stability requires," Scalia wrote.

We've gotten by for two centuries on precisely that recipe. That is what is 
done on every Election Day in this country.

First we vote. Then come the challenges, if any, which end up in court, and 
are decided there. This is not new. To have disputed ballots decided by 
courts doesn't "change the rules of the game." Those are the rules of the 
game. To do otherwise changes the law, the customs and the practice in every 
single state.

No one can possibly argue that it is the best interests of Bush or Gore that 
the votes not be counted.

There was talk yesterday � unfortunately, it proved to be untrue � that the 
Florida courts were going to ship uncounted ballots up to Washington. Those 
ballots, for better and worse, are the only evidence about the results of 
this election.

To exclude them from this decision is like saying that a murder weapon 
seized from a suspect can't be shown to a jury because of a legal 
technicality.

But Scalia says that we � the nation � can't handle the truth of counting 
those ballots, that the results might damage a Bush presidency if they show 
that he really didn't win.

So we hide the facts for the good of the country.

Or is it really for the good of Antonin Scalia, the chief justice wanna-be?

Powerlines: W. Stands for Wrongful - And suffrage hits the skids

by Harold Meyerson

Al Gore has had a crummy week, but popular sovereignty in America has had a 
catastrophic one. In Tallahassee, Judge N. Sanders Sauls ruled that a 
lagging campaign could not contest the outcome of an election by having a 
court inspect uncounted ballots. At the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Antonin 
Scalia asserted during Friday�s oral arguments that �There is no right of 
suffrage [in presidential elections] under Article II� of the Constitution � 
that is, state legislatures have given their citizens the right to vote in 
presidential elections, and can take it away if the spirit moves them. And 
though the court carefully avoided a political firestorm by remanding the 
recount decision to the Florida Supremes for reconsideration, Scalia�s 
insistence on the non-existence of the public�s right to vote for president 
was reflected in his court�s decision.

Two contradictory lessons, then, are emerging from November�s presidential 
election. One, in view of the excruciating closeness of the contest, is that 
every vote counts. The other, propounded by conservative jurists at play in 
the fields of 18th-century law and values, is that it�s not even the case 
that any vote counts. Or at least, that there�s no constitutional right to 
vote for president.

It�s not news, of course, that the Supreme Court�s one-person, one-vote 
standard applies to reapportionments but not to the selection of presidents. 
The inequities of the Electoral College are a constant of American electoral 
life; it�s only when we get a squeaker of an election that they matter. In 
this election, since W. won a disproportionate number of the smallest 
states, they mattered a great deal: Among the 18 states (including the 
District of Columbia) with three, four or five electoral votes, W. prevailed 
by a 42-to-26 margin over Gore. That is, the Electoral College, which awards 
every state two votes at the outset for its U.S. senators, padded W.�s 
total. Take that senatorial two out of each state�s vote in the total 
electoral tally, and Gore wins the Electoral College � even with W. taking 
Florida � by a 225-211 margin. It�s this small-state padding that explains 
the difference between the Electoral College vote, which will go to W. by a 
271-267 margin if he carries Florida, and the popular vote, which Gore leads 
by about 337,000 � three-tenths of 1 percent of the total vote.

But we knew this was a ticking time bomb. Political scientists and 
Democratic operatives have been writing for years that in an extremely close 
election, the Republican presidential candidate could prevail even though 
losing the popular vote because of this electoral affinity for small states. 
What we didn�t know until this week � what, to my knowledge at least, nobody 
was writing about at all � was that the very right to vote for president is 
still entirely a creation of state legislatures, that it is not, 
fundamentally, our own.

There are many ways to give the weight of law to an anti-democratic bias, of 
course, and Judge N. Sanders Sauls found one on Monday that was likely less 
constitutionally grounded than Scalia�s. Sauls rejected the vice president�s 
petition to count untallied ballots, and to look again at some dubiously 
tallied ones, in a ruling of such vehemence that Gore could count himself 
lucky he didn�t actually draw jail time.

The key to Sauls� decision was his finding that if he ordered a re-counting, 
�There is no credible statistical evidence and no other competent 
substantial evidence to establish by a preponderance a reasonable 
probability that the results of the statewide election in the state of 
Florida would be different� from the result that Katherine Harris certified. 
Sauls had already made sure this would be the case, first by refusing to 
inspect the 9,000 ballots from Dade County that the Gore attorneys argued 
could turn the election around, and second by forbidding David Boies from 
cross-examining a pro-W. statistician on what those ballots would show if 
they reflected the already counted ballots in Dade County. In short, Sauls 
ruled that Gore had failed to demonstrate that which he had refused to allow 
Gore to demonstrate.

But Sauls� was the kind of routine contempt for scrupulous elections that 
over the past month has become all but synonymous with Floridian democracy 
in action. Antonin Scalia�s case against popular rule, on the other hand, 
was a genuine bolt from the blue. Certainly, no attorney for W. had argued 
that the Florida Supremes had erred in assuming a constitutional bias toward 
suffrage in presidential elections. With the Gore folks constantly intoning, 
�Let every vote count,� it hardly seemed politic for W.�s guys to respond, 
�Actually, there�s no right to vote for president.� That kind of argument, 
repeated often enough, might just dim the luster of W.�s appeal for votes 
during the next presidential campaign.

Antonin Scalia, of course, doesn�t face voters, and his entire career seems 
bent on giving new life to every obscure anti-democratic statute that others 
have happily let slumber. The mistake of the Florida Supremes, he asserted, 
was their apparent belief in a popular franchise independent of the 
legislature. �There�s a right of suffrage in voting for the legislature,� he 
told Gore attorney Lawrence Tribe during Friday�s arguments, �but Article II 
makes it very clear that the legislature can, itself, appoint the electors.�

This case was made at greater length last week during the hearing that 
Florida�s Republican Legislature convened to see if it could indeed appoint 
its own slate of electors just in case a court-ordered recount ended in the 
intolerable anomaly of a Gore majority. Boalt Hall law professor John Yoo, a 
former clerk for Clarence Thomas, argued that the legislators would be 
remiss if they didn�t prepare themselves to appoint a slate. Writing this 
week in the friendly confines of the The Wall Street Journal editorial page, 
Yoo elaborated his argument that the very notion of popular sovereignty is a 
partisan plot. �Contrary to Democratic rhetoric,� he asserted, �the people 
have no right to vote for president or even the Electoral College; that 
power is only delegated to them by the grace of the legislature. In 
appointing the electors itself, the legislature would be directly taking up 
its constitutional functions again.� Like Scalia, Yoo cites what is 
apparently the Supreme Court�s only previous decision on this point � in 
1892, for McPherson vs. Blackmer, which leaves the choice of presidential 
electors unambiguously in the hands of the legislatures.

In sum, the now month-long democratic dysfunction in Florida is likely to 
result not only in W.�s presidency, but in the reassertion of one of the 
most elitist and anti-democratic features of our governmental structure, 
justly and understandably repressed for many decades. No wonder W. is in 
hiding: He�s taking power by virtue of votes not counted, because of the 
Electoral College�s bias against one-person, one-vote, and now on the wings 
of a ringing assault on popular rule.

We Americans have a hit-and-miss record of enlarging our democracy. Lincoln 
took Jefferson�s assertion of human equality and expanded it so that slavery 
came to be seen as inconsistent with the nation�s defining principles. 
Another hundred years had to pass before all citizens were assured of their 
right to vote (though we�ve learned from Florida in the past couple weeks 
that even that right is inconsistently applied).

Many of our original structures of government plod along unaltered to this 
day, though they are rooted in assumptions and biases that have been not 
only rejected, but in many instances forgotten. In 1892, when the court 
affirmed the power of the legislatures to choose electors, it was still the 
case that those legislatures elected United States senators. Not until the 
17th amendment to the Constitution in 1913 was that right given directly to 
the people. As for the Electoral College, it is a direct outgrowth of 
slavery. Had the constitution mandated a popular vote for president back in 
1787, the North � with a far larger population of white males than the South 
� would have seen its presidential candidates routinely prevail. By 
apportioning electors in accord with a state�s population, however � that 
is, by counting bodies, not voters � the predominantly Southern drafters of 
the constitution enabled slave states to dominate presidential elections.

Today, conservatives like Scalia and Yoo cheerfully defend the rights of 
legislatures over people, but prudently decline to invoke the demophobic and 
aristocratic beliefs that led to the establishment of these rights. 
Conservatives like George Will defend the Electoral College but omit any 
glowing references to slavery when they make their case. No account of W.�s 
rise, however, should rely on such a sanitized version of history. If he 
prevails, the first president of the 21st century will owe his office to the 
institutional legacies of the most repugnant biases of the 18th. The past, 
as Faulkner reminded us, isn�t dead � and when it comes to selecting our 
presidents, apparently it isn�t even past.

NY Times
Job of Thomas's Wife Raises Conflict-of-Interest Questions
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 � The wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said 
today that she was working at a conservative research group gathering 
r�sum�s for appointments in a possible Bush administration but that she saw 
no conflict between her job and her husband's deliberations on a case that 
could decide the presidency.

The comments from the justice's wife, Virginia Lamp Thomas, a former 
Republican Congressional aide, came as a federal judge in Nashville said 
Justice Thomas faced a serious conflict of interest as a result of his 
wife's work for the Heritage Foundation.

The foundation has close ties to the Republican Party and would probably 
have a say in the hiring of key government officials if Gov. George W. Bush 
assumed the presidency. In e-mail distributed on Capitol Hill earlier this 
month, Mrs. Thomas solicited r�sum�s "for transition purposes" from the 
government oversight committees of Congress.

A decision by Justice Thomas to recuse himself could alter the outcome of 
the case now before the court, which is weighing whether to allow a manual 
recount of votes in Florida. On Saturday, by a vote of 5 to 4, the court 
blocked the recount for now. Justice Thomas, who was appointed to the court 
by President George Bush, Governor Bush's father, was in the majority.

If Justice Thomas were to recuse himself, it could result in a 4-to-4 tie in 
the case now before it, which would allow the ruling by the Florida Supreme 
Court to stand.

"There is no conflict here," Mrs. Thomas said in an interview. She insisted 
that she rarely discussed matters before the Supreme Court with her husband 
and that Justice Thomas therefore should not consider recusing himself from 
the landmark case.

A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore said he had no comment on accusations 
of a conflict of interest. "The Vice President has the highest regard for 
the independent judiciary, so we're not going to comment on the various 
questions that have been raised," said Mark Fabiani, a Gore campaign 
spokesman.

Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush transition team, said he was aware 
that the Heritage Foundation regularly collected job r�sum�s during 
presidential transitions, but he said he did not know if the organization 
was coordinating its efforts with the Bush camp.

"Like many professional women, Mrs. Thomas should not be judged by her 
spouse," Mr. Fleischer said, denying any conflict of interest. "She should 
be judged on her own merits and qualifications."

He suggested that the accusations were the work of the Gore campaign.

A federal appellate judge, Gilbert S. Merritt of the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, said he saw a serious conflict of interest 
for Justice Thomas in deciding a case that could throw the election to 
Governor Bush.

"The spouse has obviously got a substantial interest that could be affected 
by the outcome," he said in an interview from his home in Nashville. "You 
should disqualify yourself. I think he'd be subject to some kind of 
investigation in the Senate."

Judge Merritt, who has long association with the Gore family and was 
considered a leading contender for the Supreme Court early in the Clinton 
Administration, said he would not launch a formal complaint against Justice 
Thomas.

But he urged Justice Thomas to remove himself from the case in order to 
prevent any violation of a federal law � he cited Section 455 of Title 28 of 
the United States Code, "Disqualification of Justices, Judges or 
Magistrates" � that requires court officers to excuse themselves if a spouse 
has "an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the 
proceeding."

Judge Merritt offered his views about Justice Thomas after someone in the 
Gore campaign provided The New York Times with his name and telephone 
number. Judge Merritt said he had had no direct contact with the Gore 
campaign.

Kathy Arberg, a spokesman for the Supreme Court, said she had no comment on 
the accusations of a conflict of interest. The Court has also been unwilling 
to comment on a suggestion from Gore campaign aides that Justice Antonin 
Scalia should consider recusing himself because his son works for a firm 
that represents Mr. Bush.

The son, Eugene Scalia, is a partner in the Washington office of Gibson, 
Dunn & Crutcher. Another partner, Theodore B. Olson, argued Mr. Bush's case 
before the Supreme Court today.

Referring to her husband, one of the court's most conservative and taciturn 
members, Mrs. Thomas said, "We don't talk about Supreme Court business. 
Clarence just isn't the kind. He protects me. We have our separate 
professional lives."

On Dec. 4, Mrs. Thomas sent an e- mail message to members of the House and 
Senate committees on government oversight seeking r�sum�s for the 
presidential transition. She directed would-be applicants to forward their 
r�sum�s along with a history of political activities or references to an 
associate at the foundation.

Mrs. Thomas said tonight that her recruitment efforts were bipartisan and 
not on behalf of the Bush campaign.

"The Bush campaign would be as surprised as I was by any implication that I 
was working with them," she said.

Mrs. Thomas acknowledged, however, that her search was likely to generate 
more interest among Republicans, because of the foundation's conservative 
orientation.

Just Our Bill


by Dennis Roddy, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Saturday, December 02, 2000

Lito Pena is sure of his memory. Thirty-six years ago he, then a
Democratic Party poll watcher, got into a shoving match with a
Republican who had spent the opening hours of the 1964 election doing
his damnedest to keep people from voting in south Phoenix.

"He was holding up minority voters because he knew they were going to
vote Democratic," said Pena.

The guy called himself Bill. He knew the law and applied it with the
precision of a swordsman. He sat at the table at the Bethune School, a
polling place brimming with black citizens, and quizzed voters ad
nauseam about where they were from, how long they'd lived there -- every
question in the book. A passage of the Constitution was read and people
who spoke broken English were ordered to interpret it to prove they had
the language skills to vote.

By the time Pena arrived at Bethune, he said, the line to vote was four
abreast and a block long. People were giving up and going home.
Pena told the guy to leave. They got into an argument. Shoving
followed. Arizona politics can be raw.

Finally, Pena said, the guy raised a fist as if he was fixing to throw
a punch.

"I said 'If that's what you want, I'll get someone to take you out of
here' "

Party leaders told him not to get physical, but this was the second
straight election in which Republicans had sent out people to
intellectually rough up the voters. The project even had a name:
Operation Eagle Eye.

Pena had a group of 20 iron workers holed up in a motel nearby. He
dispatched one who grabbed Bill and hustled him out of the school.

"He was pushing him across a yard and backed him into the school
building," Pena remembered.

Others in Phoenix remember Operation Eagle Eye, too.

Charlie Stevens, then the head of the local Young Republicans, said he
got a phone call from the same lawyer Pena remembered throwing out of
Bethune School. The guy wanted to know why Charlie hadn't joined
Operation Eagle Eye.

"I think they called them flying squads," Stevens said. "It was
perfectly legal. The law at the time was that you had to be able to read

English and interpret what you read."

But he didn't like the idea and he told Bill this.

"My parents were immigrants," Stevens said. They'd settled in
Cleveland, Ohio, a pair of Greeks driven out of Turkey who arrived in
the
United States with broken English and a desire to be American. After
their son went to law school and settled in Phoenix, he even
Americanized the name. Charlie Tsoukalas became Charlie Stevens.

"I didn't think it was proper to challenge my dad or my mother to
interpret the Constitution," Stevens said. "Even people who are born
here have trouble interpreting the Constitution. Lawyers have trouble
interpreting it."

The guy told Stevens that if he felt that way about it, then he could
take a pass.

There was nothing illegal going on there, Stevens said. "It just
violated my principles. I had a poor family. I grew up in the projects
in
Cleveland, Ohio."

Operation Eagle Eye had a two-year run. Eventually, Arizona changed the
laws that had allowed the kind of challenges that had devolved into
bullying.

Pena went on to serve 30 years in the Arizona State Legislature.
Stevens became a prosperous and well-regarded lawyer in Phoenix and
helped Sandra Day O'Connor get her start in law.

The guy Pena remembers tossing out of Bethune School prospered, too.

Bill Rehnquist, now better known as William H. Rehnquist, chief justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States, presided yesterday over a
case that centers on whether every vote for president was properly
recorded in the state of Florida.

In his confirmation hearings for the court in 1971, Rehnquist denied
personally intimidating voters and gave the explanation that he might
have been called to polling places on Election Day to arbitrate disputes
over voter qualifications. Fifteen years later, three more witnesses,
including a deputy U.S. attorney, told of being called to polling places
and having angry voters point to Rehnquist as their tormentor. His
defenders suggested it was a case of mistaken identity.

Now, with the presidency in the balance, Rehnquist has been asked to
read passages of the Constitution and interpret them. Once again, a
reading and interpretation will determine whose vote gets to count.

From Joe Fortunado:

Good Morning Greens and Friends:

I am pleased to report that a Federal jury has found all five Orange police 
officers charged with violating the civil rights of Earl Faison by beating 
and pepper-spraying him while handcuffed GUILTY as charged.  Mr. Faison was 
an innocent man caught up in the State-sponsored frenzy to round up suspects 
following the shooting death of an Orange officer, Joyce Carnegie. Even 
though the victory is bittersweet, since Earl is not here, it is still a 
victory, both for the Faison-Williams family and for all who believe in 
justice. Congratulations and heartfelt thanks are in order for Larry Hamm, 
Chairman of the Peoples Organization for Progress, for his untiring efforts 
to rally the troops to make sure this case and the issues of police brutality 
and racial profiling would not be swept under the rug. Even when we got tired 
or busy with other things, Larry and POP kept the focus on the critical 
importance of acheiving justice in this case.

 I also want to thank all of the Greens and other supporters who came out 
over the last two years to our demonstrations, forums and press conferences 
to lend support.

The work is just beginning, however. It is now time to DEMAND that the State 
of New Jersey reopen the investigation into the killing of Earl Faison and 
that the State present the case to a grand jury for murder indictments. 
Please call NJ Attorney General John Farmer TODAY at (609) 292-3508 to demand 
that the case be presented to the grand jury.

Alcoa's Chairman Is Named by Bush to Treasury Post
By ALISON MITCHELL

AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 20 -- President-elect George W. Bush today chose Paul H. 
O'Neill, a business executive with extensive government experience, as his 
candidate for treasury secretary, calling him a ''steady voice'' who could 
''calm people's nerves, calm the markets, calm those who would speculate in 
the dollar'' in the event of an economic downturn.

A day after the Federal Reserve said it was shifting from fighting inflation 
to steering the economy away from recession, Mr. Bush put an emphasis on his 
choice for the senior economic policy position in his administration by 
announcing Mr. O'Neill's selection at a morning news conference and leaving 
the announcement of three other cabinet-designees until the afternoon.

''I'm hopeful that this economy stays strong,'' Mr. Bush said as he 
introduced Mr. O'Neill, 65, the retiring chairman of Alcoa, the world's 
largest manufacturer of aluminum. But with the Fed pointing to rising energy 
prices, an erosion in consumer confidence and stress in financial markets, 
Mr. Bush added, ''I'm also a realist, and one of my jobs is to think ahead, 
just in case.''

Mr. Bush said, ''We are going to play the hand we are dealt,'' and he 
repeated his calls for tax cuts, expanded global trade, less regulation, and 
a plan to allow the transfer of some Social Security taxes to private 
investment accounts, all cornerstones of his fiscal strategy. He said his 
Social Security plan and his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut over a decade 
would increase the flow of capital into private markets and spur growth.

In an afternoon round of cabinet announcements, Mr. Bush tapped his longtime 
friend and campaign chairman, Donald L. Evans, 54, an oil man, to be 
secretary of commerce; Melquiades R. Martinez, 54, the chairman of Orange 
County, Fla., as housing secretary; and Ann M. Veneman, 51, the former 
director of California's agriculture department, as agriculture secretary.

Mr. Bush also cleaned out his office at the Texas Capitol, including his 
autographed baseball collection, and met with 30 religious figures, a number 
of black ministers among them, to begin planning how to give religious 
groups a major role in providing social services.

Mr. Bush plans to announce his resignation as governor at 10 a.m. Thursday, 
and the lieutenant governor, Rick Perry, will be sworn in as governor at 3 
p.m., The Associated Press reported. .

Republicans close to the Bush campaign said that the president-elect was 
close to naming several fellow Republican governors to cabinet posts, 
perhaps on Friday. Christie Whitman, the moderate governor of New Jersey, 
would be named to head the Environmental Protection Agency, the officials 
said.

Mr. Bush had also tentatively decided on Gov. Tommy P. Thompson of 
Wisconsin, for the Department of Health and Human Services, advisers said. 
Mr. Thompson is known as a pioneer in welfare policy and as an opponent of 
abortion. He is considered acceptable to conservatives for the influential 
domestic policy post.

Gov. Mark Racicot of Montana, a close friend of Mr. Bush who became a 
prominent spokesman for the Texas governor during the battle over the 
presidential vote in Florida, met with Mr. Bush today. Advisers to Mr. Bush 
said that Mr. Racicot had been the leading contender for several posts, 
including attorney general and interior secretary.

But tonight, a spokeswoman for Mr. Racicot said in a statement that he had 
withdrawn his name for consideration as attorney general because of ''family 
considerations.'' The statement left unclear whether he would accept another 
post.

Republicans have predicted that Democrats would try to use the confirmation 
hearings on the choice for the attorney general to showcase their 
differences with Republicans over issues like gun control and prosecution of 
hate crimes.

But this morning, Mr. O'Neill had star billing -- the second cabinet choice 
after Gen. Colin L. Powell for secretary of state -- as Mr. Bush sought to 
send reassuring signals that he was prepared to manage a slipping economic 
situation and would be ready to move aggressively on tax policy and fiscal 
policy.

Although Mr. Bush had also been considering several Wall Street executives 
for treasury secretary, he emphasized Mr. O'Neill's range of experience, 
including years in the government budget office under Presidents Richard M. 
Nixon and Gerald R. Ford and in the private sector.

''He has run large corporations and, even more importantly, has employed 
large numbers of people,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He knows that all of our 
decisions and one of the key goals of this administration will be to make 
sure that all Americans can find high-paying, high-quality jobs.''

Mr. O'Neill himself disclosed the personal connections that would help him 
in his job. He said he and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney, who had been 
White House chief of staff under Mr. Ford, ''go back many years,'' and he 
called Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, a close 
friend who was instrumental in bringing him to Alcoa in 1987.

Conservatives had raised alarms about Mr. O'Neill because he had once backed 
gasoline and carbon taxes, which Vice President Al Gore had also favored. 
Standing at Mr. Bush's side, however, he said that he believed in the 
president-elect's policy and that his days as a ''free-ranging, 
self-admitted maverick'' had come to an end. At that, Mr. Bush gave a mock 
sigh of relief.

Mr. Bush said any possible economic slowdown should not make the idea of 
putting Social Security taxes into the market less politically appealing, 
arguing that the policy had to be viewed over the long term.

Mr. Bush's talk of an economic slowdown drew a sharp response from the 
Clinton administration, with a White House official suggesting that the 
president-elect was simply trying to sell his agenda.

''When most experts are still projecting solid growth, a new president 
should not be hurting confidence by talking down our economy for political 
positioning,'' said Gene Sperling, President Clinton's national economic 
adviser.

Mr. Bush also expanded on his views on energy policy, saying that he wanted 
to increase the natural gas, coal and energy supply. He called for a 
''hemispheric'' energy policy, exploration for natural gas in Western 
states, a review of policies on pipeline construction and development of 
coal reserves as well as investment in clean-coal technology.

With today's announcements and the ones to come, the shape of a Bush cabinet 
is becoming clearer, including Bush loyalists like Mr. Evans; veterans of 
the administration of Mr. Bush's father, like General Powell; officials like 
Mr. O'Neill with ties to Mr. Cheney; and a sprinkling of governors who 
rallied early around Mr. Bush's candidacy.

Many of those being named have extensive government backgrounds. Ms. 
Veneman, for example, was a deputy secretary of agriculture under Mr. Bush's 
father before she was California's agriculture secretary from 1995 to 1999.

One Bush adviser said the president-elect was looking for experience and 
competence, saying: ''This is not learning-curve time. People say the knock 
on Bush is he's not experienced? Well, look at what he has surrounded 
himself with.''

Mr. Bush has also made a point of reaching out to minorities in his 
appointments. Mr. Martinez, who was co-chairman of Mr. Bush's campaign in 
Florida and is a close ally of his brother, Jeb, the state's Republican 
governor, fled Cuba when he was 15.

Mr. Bush acknowledged today that he had failed to draw many minority votes. 
''My hope is that when people who may not have supported me get to know 
me,'' he said, ''they realize that I am just as intent on being a good 
president for them as for those folks who supported me.''

So far, Mr. Bush has not produced a Democrat for his cabinet, despite aides' 
pledges that he would try to.

Officials said one Democrat, the Rev. Floyd Flake, a former congressman from 
Queens, was on a list of contenders for education secretary. National 
security experts in the Republican Party said Mr. Bush had settled on a 
deputy national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, an arms control expert 
who was an assistant secretary of defense when Mr. Cheney was defense 
secretary.

Subject:Re: What's Hiding In GW's Cabinet? by R Lederman
Message:

Matt:

Nobody in our movement ever said that there was "no difference" between the 
Bush forces and the Goreistas. What we were (and are) saying is that there is 
not enough of a difference for us to forego our building towards an 
independent political movement and party at this time.

Sure, we recognize the grim reality that the Bush administration will mean 
further and perhaps accelerated attacks on the people. But we also recognize 
that the Clinton/Gore administration also brought about severe attacks on the 
people in the guise of "welfare reform," Federal crime bills, support for the 
death penalty, the embargo on Iraq (which the UN says is killing 5,000 
children a month), support for Star Wars and increased military spending, 
etc., etc., ad naseum.

Let's be clear about who ARE our friends and who are our enemies. The 
Clinton/Gore administration did not succeed in stopping the right wing in the 
eight years they held power. They barely tried. That's because their lukewarm 
initiatives are designed to prop up this system of corporate welfare and 
imperialist domination. Only an independent political force can halt the 
advance of the right. 

Moreover, overestimating the danger of the right can only lead us to a 
misplaced reliance on the more "liberal" sections of the bourgeoisie, 
represented by Clinton/Gore and the entrenched labor aristocracy. The 
situation in the US today is simply not the same as the situation in 
pre-Hitler Germany. Although there certainly are some fascist types lurking 
in the halls of power, most of our more conservatives in power are 
Constitutional conservatives. To dogmatically insist that these folks are 
fascist and that we must lineup behind the Clinton/Gore forces would be to 
lead people into the arms of the "lesser of two evils" and would set our 
movement back.  When you support the lesser of two evils, you still get evil. 
We have a good start towards a peoples party; let's build on it.

Joe

We lived through Nixon. We lived through Reagan. we lived through Bush, Sr. 
We'll live through Junior. Many Iraqi children and Palestinian youth did not 
live through Clinton/Gore.

wasn't that one of the pillars of Nader's line? that gore/bush are the same

most people who voted for Nader

when asked about the rigging of the florida elections , nader responded 
"flip a coin" (as a way to resolve the despute) - once again ignoring so 
many civil rights issues - what kind of working class leadership is that?

Who is advocating that we forego our building of an independent political

i very much believe that representatives of the extreme right (Dubya 
included) act on a foundation of fascist ideology. i have no problem 
identifying them as fascists. also, there are historical links between these 
people and the nazi party (1930s- 40s).

When you support the lesser of two evils, you still get evil.

there is a big difference between supporting gore as a leader (which i 
don't) and supporting his becoming president in order to slow down the  
national movement to the right (which i do). it is simply a tactical choice. 
if nader stood a chance to actually win, i would have supported him.

Subject:Fascism vs. Communism
Message:

Given the accusations by Frank Bright at last month's General Meeting
of the New Brunswick Peoples Campaign that certain members of the
coalition are "fascist," I thought now might be an appropriate time
to put forward this abstract on what the theoretical and historical
basis of fascism actually is, contrasted with the theoretical and
historical basis of communism.  Consider this merely an outline of a
broader theoretical work.  I give citations where appropriate.  This
is in no way a comprehensive work, as much more can be said and has
been said on this topic.

Socio-Cultural Manifestations

The most prominent socio-cultural feature of fascist society is the
lack of social or democratic institutions whereby the populace can
interface with the government.  While liberal democracy promises all
citizens equality before the law, the law being the impartial guide
to justice, justice under fascism is conceived in terms of the will
of the supreme leader.  One Nazi lawyer wrote in the Frankfurt
Zeitung in 1935, "Previously one spoke of justice and injustice, but
now a judge before reaching a decision must ask himself: What would
the Fuehrer say to this?"
Rather than the intervening institutions of the courts or civil
society or law, fascist society is characterized by a direct
connection between the national subject and the Supreme Leader.  In
this way an entire populace abandons its freedom, political and
otherwise, and looks toward the leader for all direction in action. 
In the ideal fascist society, one is free and all others are slaves. 
The relationship is the political analogue to a religious subject's
connection to a transcendent God, where all freedom is abandoned, all
action is predetermined, and every task is set upon with the idea of
increasing the glory of the leader.  Indeed, the fascist leader is
the incarnation of God on Earth.  One need only look at footage of
Nazi rallies to get a sense of the greater-than-life awe inspired by
Nazi aesthetics.
(For more on abandonment of freedom in the existential sense, look at
Erich Fromm, Escape From Freedom, where he treats the subject in more
depth.)

Ideological and Class Structures

Along with the emphasis on complete faith and devotion to the Supreme
Leader, there is inherent in fascism a romantic appeal to religion
and mythological heroism.  In this regard fascism is a direct
reaction to Enlightenment thought, as it stresses mythos over
rational thought.  Emphasis is on an emotional, purely subjective
connection to the fatherland and the leader. In fact, all capacity of
independent reasoning is given up and over to the whim of the leader.
 The turn toward a religious relationship with the leader is more
deep than a simple rebellion against Enlightenment thought; the
reaction is against the entire system of Enlightenment practice,
including the free market.  Fascist parties come to power in times of
economic crisis, promising a return to the glory of bygone days --
that is, before the cash nexus came to determine social relations,
and when a true sense of *belonging* to a fatherland and a king
pervaded social relations.  Granted, no such time ever existed, and a
good question to ask is
Why do people ever believe such a thing?  The answer to this question
can be found in the concrete historical circumstances leading up to
the rise of fascism, namely the crisis of liberal democracy and
capitalism, and its tendency to revert to anarchy and economic
collapse.  In times of economic crisis, if the working class is not
properly organized and prepared ideologically to present a true
challenge to the bourgeoisie, then the failure of the free market is
expressed by the proletariat in terms of the spontaneous uprisings
and destruction of property.  Such a state of affairs is entirely
unacceptable to the bourgeoisie, because law and order are
*necessary* in order to make profit. Law and order is the only way
the bourgeoisie can break strikes (with the police), conquer new
markets (with the army), keep the cost of raw materials low (with
tariffs), etc.  Overthrow of the state means the unequivocal
impotence of the bourgeoisie.  When liberal democracy goes into
crisis the industrialists will resort to
any means necessary to preserve their ability to make profit.  A
strong dictator becomes the answer to this.  A man (it is always a
man) who promises to return law and order.  The bourgeoisie would
rather *not* have dictatorship.  The ability to legislate through
parliament, congress is a strength for the industrialists.  But
accepting a dictator is the only way they can conserve *any* power. 
Dictatorship is *always* preferable to anarchy.  And when liberal
democracy goes into crisis, these are the two alternatives the
bourgeoisie are faced with (barring, of course, the organizing
uprising of the proletariat).  The fascist leader publically rides
into power on the backs of the two most reactionary classes --
peasantry and petite bourgeoisie -- because they are the classes that
have the most to lose under the free market.  That is, capitalism
ideally moves the peasants off the land into factories and phases out
the inferior production methods of the petite bourgeoisie.  It is
this fear of being removed from
land that that fascist appeals to when he invokes the glory of the
Fatherland.  Capitalism and Enlightenment destroy any existential
roots to the Earth and replace them with the cold rationality of
calculation.  Fascism appeals to this loss and invokes the
romanticism of religion, mythos, connection to the soil, etc.  But
make no mistake: while the fascist leader pays such lip service to
these classes, he is *actually* supported, the entire time, by the
most powerful industrialists.  The gran bourgeoisie, not the petite
bourgeoisie, are the ones who abandon liberal democracy and bring in
a Strongman to restore law and order against the proletariat.  (For
more on this aspect of fascism, see Karl Marx, 18th Brumaire of Louis
Bonaparte, or Barrington Moore, Social Origins of Dictatorship and
Democracy).

Why did Stalinist Russia look an awful lot like Fascist Germany?
It should be clear by now that fascism invariably results from the
direct alliance of the industrialists and the state where the two are
almost indifferentiable.  This was certainly the case in Prussia,
where industrialization from the end of the 19th century on was
carried out from the top-down.  This was also the case in Soviet
Russia with Stalin's Five-Year Plans.  While industrialization in
England took place in a gradual, bottom-up fashion, the same was not
true of industrialization in Germany and the Soviet Union.  England
experienced a gradual change in social relationships as capitalism
organically grew from the bottom up.  It was precisely the organic
nature of this evolution that made liberal democracy strong: if the
struggle for liberal democracy is intrinsically linked to the
economic *practice* of a class, then it is all the more likely to
hold.  This is not to say that this prevents the rise of fascism in
such countries.  It is only to say that a bottom-up industrialization
process seems to

relationship to production, it is the Party that decides what should
be produced, how it should be produced, how much of it should be
produced, etc.  To justify this move toward absolutism, Stalin

Subject:Fascism vs. Communism
Message:

Given the accusations by Frank Bright at last month's General Meeting
of the New Brunswick Peoples Campaign that certain members of the
coalition are "fascist," I thought now might be an appropriate time
to put forward this abstract on what the theoretical and historical
basis of fascism actually is, contrasted with the theoretical and
historical basis of communism.  Consider this merely an outline of a
broader theoretical work.  I give citations where appropriate.  This
is in no way a comprehensive work, as much more can be said and has
been said on this topic.

Socio-Cultural Manifestations

The most prominent socio-cultural feature of fascist society is the
lack of social or democratic institutions whereby the populace can
interface with the government.  While liberal democracy promises all
citizens equality before the law, the law being the impartial guide
to justice, justice under fascism is conceived in terms of the will
of the supreme leader.  One Nazi lawyer wrote in the Frankfurt
Zeitung in 1935, "Previously one spoke of justice and injustice, but
now a judge before reaching a decision must ask himself: What would
the Fuehrer say to this?"
Rather than the intervening institutions of the courts or civil
society or law, fascist society is characterized by a direct
connection between the national subject and the Supreme Leader.  In
this way an entire populace abandons its freedom, political and
otherwise, and looks toward the leader for all direction in action. 
In the ideal fascist society, one is free and all others are slaves. 
The relationship is the political analogue to a religious subject's
connection to a transcendent God, where all freedom is abandoned, all
action is predetermined, and every task is set upon with the idea of
increasing the glory of the leader.  Indeed, the fascist leader is
the incarnation of God on Earth.  One need only look at footage of
Nazi rallies to get a sense of the greater-than-life awe inspired by
Nazi aesthetics.
(For more on abandonment of freedom in the existential sense, look at
Erich Fromm, Escape From Freedom, where he treats the subject in more
depth.)

Ideological and Class Structures

Along with the emphasis on complete faith and devotion to the Supreme
Leader, there is inherent in fascism a romantic appeal to religion
and mythological heroism.  In this regard fascism is a direct
reaction to Enlightenment thought, as it stresses mythos over
rational thought.  Emphasis is on an emotional, purely subjective
connection to the fatherland and the leader. In fact, all capacity of
independent reasoning is given up and over to the whim of the leader.
 The turn toward a religious relationship with the leader is more
deep than a simple rebellion against Enlightenment thought; the
reaction is against the entire system of Enlightenment practice,
including the free market.  Fascist parties come to power in times of
economic crisis, promising a return to the glory of bygone days --
that is, before the cash nexus came to determine social relations,
and when a true sense of *belonging* to a fatherland and a king
pervaded social relations.  Granted, no such time ever existed, and a
good question to ask is
Why do people ever believe such a thing?  The answer to this question
can be found in the concrete historical circumstances leading up to
the rise of fascism, namely the crisis of liberal democracy and
capitalism, and its tendency to revert to anarchy and economic
collapse.  In times of economic crisis, if the working class is not
properly organized and prepared ideologically to present a true
challenge to the bourgeoisie, then the failure of the free market is
expressed by the proletariat in terms of the spontaneous uprisings
and destruction of property.  Such a state of affairs is entirely
unacceptable to the bourgeoisie, because law and order are
*necessary* in order to make profit. Law and order is the only way
the bourgeoisie can break strikes (with the police), conquer new
markets (with the army), keep the cost of raw materials low (with
tariffs), etc.  Overthrow of the state means the unequivocal
impotence of the bourgeoisie.  When liberal democracy goes into
crisis the industrialists will resort to
any means necessary to preserve their ability to make profit.  A
strong dictator becomes the answer to this.  A man (it is always a
man) who promises to return law and order.  The bourgeoisie would
rather *not* have dictatorship.  The ability to legislate through
parliament, congress is a strength for the industrialists.  But
accepting a dictator is the only way they can conserve *any* power. 
Dictatorship is *always* preferable to anarchy.  And when liberal
democracy goes into crisis, these are the two alternatives the
bourgeoisie are faced with (barring, of course, the organizing
uprising of the proletariat).  The fascist leader publically rides
into power on the backs of the two most reactionary classes --
peasantry and petite bourgeoisie -- because they are the classes that
have the most to lose under the free market.  That is, capitalism
ideally moves the peasants off the land into factories and phases out
the inferior production methods of the petite bourgeoisie.  It is
this fear of being removed from
land that that fascist appeals to when he invokes the glory of the
Fatherland.  Capitalism and Enlightenment destroy any existential
roots to the Earth and replace them with the cold rationality of
calculation.  Fascism appeals to this loss and invokes the
romanticism of religion, mythos, connection to the soil, etc.  But
make no mistake: while the fascist leader pays such lip service to
these classes, he is *actually* supported, the entire time, by the
most powerful industrialists.  The gran bourgeoisie, not the petite
bourgeoisie, are the ones who abandon liberal democracy and bring in
a Strongman to restore law and order against the proletariat.  (For
more on this aspect of fascism, see Karl Marx, 18th Brumaire of Louis
Bonaparte, or Barrington Moore, Social Origins of Dictatorship and
Democracy).

Why did Stalinist Russia look an awful lot like Fascist Germany?
It should be clear by now that fascism invariably results from the
direct alliance of the industrialists and the state where the two are
almost indifferentiable.  This was certainly the case in Prussia,
where industrialization from the end of the 19th century on was
carried out from the top-down.  This was also the case in Soviet
Russia with Stalin's Five-Year Plans.  While industrialization in
England took place in a gradual, bottom-up fashion, the same was not
true of industrialization in Germany and the Soviet Union.  England
experienced a gradual change in social relationships as capitalism
organically grew from the bottom up.  It was precisely the organic
nature of this evolution that made liberal democracy strong: if the
struggle for liberal democracy is intrinsically linked to the
economic *practice* of a class, then it is all the more likely to
hold.  This is not to say that this prevents the rise of fascism in
such countries.  It is only to say that a bottom-up industrialization
process seems to
have made liberal democracy stronger.  Top-down industrialization, on
the other hand, seems to be the economic basis for fascism. 
(Barrington Moore)  Up until Stalin, the revolution was fought in the
USSR from the bottom-up.  Stalin actually has to *abandon* the
principles of Communism, and hence the revolution, in order to carry
out his plan for industrialization.  Rather than allowing the
proletariat the power to determine production through an unalienated
relationship to production, it is the Party that decides what should

The relationship between Stalin and the Bolshevik Revolution is decidely more complex than I layed it out.  It is not so simple as Stalin taking power and changing the course of events.  If one analyzes this situation dialectically, it is impossible to avoid the fact that Stalin's rule grew out of Bolshevik rule and would have been impossible without the all-powerful vanguard party ruling in the place of the proletariat.  Tons has been written on this.  For example, look at Cyril Smith, "How the Marxists Buried Marx" for an historical and (mostly) philosophical exposition on this.

Subject:Re: [nbpc] Re: What's Hiding In GW's Cabinet? by R Lederman
Message:

First off, if there is anyone that got caught in this loop and prefers not 
to receive any more of these messages, please let us know and we'll take you 
off.  It started because I felt that there was information that had to get 
out as broadly as possible, and it has developed into a good and much needed 
debate.  That said:

*************************************************************************
Joe, thank you for your response.  I agree with you that our main task is to 
further the work of building an independent political movement and 
independent party.  How that movement is to be defined, however, will worked 
out through continued practice and theoretical discussion and debate.  It 
has been the position of the New Jersey Freedom Organization that the united 
front/coalition building is the best model to mobilize as broad a 
constituency as possible to combat the rightward surge locally and 
nationally, while simultaneously building a movement capable of more than 
protesting--that our ultimate task is the seizure of power.  As Kristina 
pointed out, we put this into practice by initiating the New Brunswick 
People's Campaign for City Council, which itself was a model for people's 
democracy (our first act was a public convention where everything from 
candidates to the campaign manager and our platform was voted on).  Although 
we didn't win the election, we mobilized the city like never before, shook 
up the entrenched power structure (who are corporate Democrats) and showed 
that they are actually most vulnerable around the question of democracy 
itself--something I think we agree that this system cannot ultimately 
deliver to the majority.

I reiterate all of this to draw a line of demarcation between types of 
independent movements, and that the reason Nader didn't win our support is 
that his campaign fell dangerously short in critical areas.  You said that 
"nobody in our movement ever said that there was 'no difference' between the 
Bush forces and the Goreistas."  This is simply not true.  It was repeated 
over and over as a mantra from the Green Party leadership to Nader's rank 
and file supporters.  If you were personally clear that there were 
contradictions, that message did not get out.  This gets back to our 
disagreement on the question of democratic revolution vs socialist 
revolution, as the present historic task.  It has been the position of NJFO, 
as put forward by Baraka, that the democratic revolution has never been 
completed--a historic fact that can be traced back to the last time the 
electoral college overturned the popular vote (Hayes-Tilden Compromise), 
which intentionally resulted in the undermining of Reconstruction in the 
south, and handing the south back to the deposed slavocracy and the Klan.

It is irresponsible for progressives and revolutionaries--especially for 
those of us who benefit from what this system does offer in terms of 
democratic rights & access to resources--to shrug and suggest that we've 
survived the right in power before, so we'll get through this.  It is the 
very same sectors of the population for which this country has never been a 
democracy that are most vulnerable to rightward swings, erosion of civil 
rights and lack of economic opportunities.

I agree that in eight years, Clinton/Gore abandoned the traditional 
Democratic constituency and raced to coopt the Republican social and 
economic agenda.  As Kris pointed out, we never once suggested that Clinton 
or Gore could be depended on as leaders of the people.  Clearly they are 
corporate whores for Imperialism; this "unprecedented" economy has had 
limited beneficiaries (certainly not those who have been downsized, 
profiled, or had their welfare de-formed) But the abandonment of the 
traditional left, and the centrist-ization of the Democrats has NOT meant 
that the Democrats and Republicans have melded into one indistinguishable 
corporate party, as HAS been asserted over and over by Greens, Naderites, 
WBAI hosts...  It means that right before our eyes, we are witnessing the 
rightward thrust of the entire political spectrum, and the Republicans are 
accelerating rapidly in that direction.  It means that the ultra-right has 
been empowered.  We need to look no farther than Ashcroft, Bush/Cheney's 
appointment to Attorney General, who is being touted as the most 
arch-conservative politician ever to hold the position.  We now have an 
honorary Bob Jones U. graduate as watchdog of the federal Civil Rights 
legislation!  This was an open concession by Bush/Cheney to their extreme 
right constituency.  Again, the ones who are going to feel the effects of 
this first and worst are the ones who already have the least access to 
democracy.

So Nader's campaign insisted that the Republi-crats are one corporate party, 
so vote for him or join the Greens, as this is the third party movement 
we've all been waiting for.  Yet, it was never a movement based on coalition 
building and united front work, with democratically elected candidates and 
leadership, not to mention platform. (Case in point was Nader's unforgivable 
positions on Roe v. Wade & states rights.) When I went to the Rutgers Law 
School in Newark to hear the Green candidates speak (Nader, Joe Fortunato, 
Bruce Afrin for NJ Senate) I didn't see anything that resembled a Newark 
based coalition movement.  The closest they came was with an endorsement 
from Larry Hamm of People's Organization for Progress, who endorsed him as 
an individual, not on behalf of an organization. The rest of the audience 
appeared to be older, white, middle-class lefties of various 
tendencies--pretty much representative of the Greens/Nader's 
constituency--but NOT in the least representative of the decades of 
roots-based revolutionary organizing that defines Newark itself. Or else 
Afrin would never have gotten away with his traitorous commentary that he 
would be proud to derail Corzine's campaign and cause "honest" Bob Franks to 
win the NJ Senate.
For the record, Nader didn't bother to distance himself from that position.

These things need to be resolved in order to move foward in a real way and 
turn this impending crisis into an opportunity.  All democratic classes must 
work tirelessly toward coalition building and a broad united front to keep 
this country from going over the precipice.  In doing so we will 
simultaneously be building the independant movement that will be capable of 
siezing political power.

On the national level, we can start with a broad call for the abolition of 
the Electoral College; Advance the call for the abolition of the Senate (the 
US version of the British House of Lords, and a leftover form of 
Constitutional Monarchy); Mobilize to end the existence of the 
anti-democratic Republican Party on the grounds that they trampled all over 
the Constitution with this election; and insist that Bush is an illegitimate 
President who was appointed by party operatives in the Supreme Court; 
Advocate against the WTO/IMF; etc.

It is on the local level, however, that we must seize power where we can put 
our hands on it--school boards, city councils, review boards, student 
governments, newspapers, and now, defending free speech on the radio by 
saving WBAI as an independant institution.  Only when we have the power to 
elect the dog-catcher can we move towards state and national level power 
struggle in a meaningful way.  But it has to come from the ground up, not 
the other way around.

In Unity & Struggle, Matthew Smith

Defense Secretary Chosen; Held Same Post Under Ford
By ERIC SCHMITT

WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 � President-elect George W. Bush today selected Donald 
H. Rumsfeld, a veteran Washington insider and champion of missile defenses, 
to be secretary of defense, the same job Mr. Rumsfeld held in the Ford 
administration a quarter-century ago before entering the world of business.

Picking Mr. Rumsfeld, 68, a blunt- spoken former Navy fighter pilot and 
Illinois congressman, brings to the Pentagon's top job a man with the 
military experience and stature on Capitol Hill to press Mr. Bush's 
priorities to modernize the armed forces and build a missile shield against 
emerging threats.

"This is a man who has got great judgment," Mr. Bush told reporters here, 
introducing Mr. Rumsfeld. "He has got strong vision. And he's going to be a 
great secretary of defense � again."

Conservatives, already elated by Mr. Bush's selection of Senator John 
Ashcroft of Missouri, to be attorney general-designate, expressed jubilation 
today at the selection of Mr. Rumsfeld, a foreign policy hawk and social 
conservative who served as national chairman of Bob Dole's failed 
presidential campaign in 1996. Senators from both parties predicted a swift 
confirmation.

Mr. Bush made the surprise announcement here today with Vice President-elect 
Dick Cheney standing silently by his side.

Mr. Rumsfeld, who has long-term political ties to Mr. Cheney, was reported 
to be a front-runner as the next director of central intelligence, but his 
name came up for defense secretary after Mr. Bush expressed second thoughts 
about two leading candidates for that job. Those candidates were former 
Senator Daniel R. Coats of Indiana, who left Mr. Bush unconvinced after a 
meeting on Dec. 18 that the senator was the right man for the job, and Paul 
D. Wolfowitz, a former top Pentagon official who some in the Bush camp 
feared could be overwhelmed by the sprawling military bureaucracy. Mr. 
Cheney was then directed to broaden the search.

Mr. Cheney has played a major role in cabinet selections, but never more so 
than with Mr. Rumsfeld. It was Mr. Rumsfeld who brought Mr. Cheney into the 
Ford White House as a deputy chief of staff, and who has been the vice 
president-elect's prototype of a political executive ever since.

The two men share remarkably similar r�sum�s � congressman, White House 
chief of staff, secretary of defense and corporate chief executive � as well 
as a results-driven, no- nonsense management style. Mr. Cheney was the last 
Republican secretary of defense, serving under Mr. Bush's father, President 
George Bush, and had a very clear idea of the ideal candidate for the job: 
qualifications that Mr. Rumsfeld fit to a T.

The only trick was persuading Mr. Rumsfeld to serve again, a challenge that 
Mr. Cheney took on over the past several days, transition aides said.

"I tell you, this has all happened very rapidly," Mr. Rumsfeld, who has been 
working as an independent consultant, told reporters.

Mr. Rumsfeld, who served as secretary of defense for 14 months from 1975 to 
1977, after the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, is a skilled 
bureaucratic infighter who will serve as a complement and counterweight on 
Mr. Bush's national security team, especially to Gen. Colin L. Powell, the 
secretary of state-designate.

But he is perhaps best known recently for heading a bipartisan panel in 1998 
that concluded that nations like North Korea and Iran could threaten the 
United States with long- range missiles sooner than American intelligence 
analysts had predicted. This has led Mr. Rumsfeld to be a leading advocate 
for missile defenses against such threats.

The panel's report became one of the most influential in recent American 
military planning. Mr. Rumsfeld was among a group of Republican foreign 
policy luminaries, including Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz, former 
secretaries of state, who flanked Mr. Bush at a news conference in May when 
the the Texas governor renewed his pledge to develop robust missile 
defenses.

With Mr. Rumsfeld's nomination, Mr. Bush has chosen eight members he expects 
to have in his cabinet. There are 14 statutory cabinet members, but every 
president can elevate any number of agencies to that level during his term. 
All of them must be confirmed by the Senate.

Aides said they expected Mr. Bush to make additional personnel announcements 
on Friday before returning to Texas to celebrate the New Year at his ranch.

Mr. Bush said he hoped to have his cabinet appointments finished by the end 
of the first week of January, adding with a laugh that he did not want to be 
held to that deadline.

"Let me just put it to you this way: On Inauguration Day, we will be ready 
to assume our respective offices," Mr. Bush said.

But the president-elect acknowledged that he was having trouble fulfilling 
his goal of recruiting a Democrat or two to serve in his cabinet.

"I've talked to some Democrats about whether or not there may be an interest 
of leaving their current positions," Mr. Bush said. "And most people want to 
stay in place."

Mr. Bush did make several senior White House staff appointments today. He 
named Joseph Hagin, a deputy campaign manager, to be deputy chief of staff 
for operations; and Joshua Bolten, the campaign policy director, to be 
deputy chief of staff for policy. Ari Fleischer, the campaign and transition 
spokesman, was named White House press secretary.

Mr. Cheney also announced that two former Pentagon aides would join his 
White House staff: I. Lewis Libby to be his chief of staff and David 
Addington to be his counsel.

Explaining why he chose Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Bush noted his experience in 
government and in the corporate world. But he underscored Mr. Rumsfeld's 
role on the missile-threat panel.

"`I felt he did an extraordinary job with a delicate assignment," Mr. Bush 
said. "He brought people together to understand the realities of the modern 
world."

Mr. Bush said he would rely on Mr. Rumsfeld to do "a selling job" on 
Congress to support not only the contentious missile defense proposal, which 
faces strong opposition from many Democrats as well as foreign allies, but 
also the costly task of revamping the military to deal with a new security 
threats, from terrorism to chemical-weapon attacks.

"One of Secretary Rumsfeld's first tasks will be to challenge the status quo 
inside the Pentagon, to develop a strategy necessary to have a force 
equipped for warfare of the 21st century," Mr. Bush said.

Mr. Rumsfeld kept his remarks brief and rather broad: "It is clearly not a 
time at the Pentagon for presiding or calibrating modestly. Rather, we are 
in a new national security environment. We do need to be arranged to deal 
with the new threats, not the old ones, with information warfare, missile 
defense, terrorism, defense of our space assets and the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction throughout the world."

One area that Mr. Rumsfeld said he would not revisit is the military's 
"don't ask, don't tell" policy on gays in the armed forces.

"That is not an issue that President-elect Bush has discussed in his 
pronouncements on defense," Mr. Rumsfeld said.

On Capitol Hill, Mr. Rumsfeld's announcement won praise from Democrats and 
Republicans.

"The nation is fortunate that this experienced, tested, tough-minded `old 
hand' joins the strong Bush corral for national security," said Senator John 
W. Warner, a Virginia Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee, 
which will hold confirmation hearings on Mr. Rumsfeld.

The committee's senior Democrat, Carl Levin of Michigan, called Mr. Rumsfeld 
"a strong choice."

At today's news conference, Mr. Bush offered insight into how he envisions 
his national security team to work and what his role will be. When asked how 
much influence Mr. Cheney and his close friend and ally, General Powell, a 
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would have at the Pentagon, 
Mr. Bush said, "I think little."

Then, warming to a subject that he has acknowledged having little expertise 
in, Mr. Bush continued, referring to Mr. Rumsfeld, "I picked a strong leader 
who is willing to listen to others but is a decisive leader. General 
Powell's a strong figure, and Dick Cheney's no shrinking violet. But neither 
is Don Rumsfeld."

"There's going to be disagreements," Mr. Bush said. "I hope there is 
disagreement, because I know the disagreement will be based upon solid 
thought. And what you need to know is that if there is disagreement, I'll be 
prepared to make the decision necessary for the good of the country."

Campaign costs soar in towns

12/28/00

BY JOE DONOHUE
STAR-LEDGER STAFF

No one has to tell Helen Merolla that the cost of local political campaigns 
is soaring.


As an independent candidate in Piscataway this year, she lost by nearly a 
2-1 margin after Democratic mayoral candidate Brian Wahler outspent her 
$230,000 to $10,000.


"What they did was to produce glossies that arrived at the house every day 
for about 10 days. That's very difficult to overcome," she said.


"I'm extremely flattered by the amount of money that was spent. The 
Democratic organization normally spends about $50,000 on an election," she 
said.


The Piscataway election is a microcosm of what is happening throughout the 
state, according to a study released yesterday by the state Election Law 
Enforcement Commission.


Local campaigns are becoming increasingly sophisticated as more candidates 
use polls, consultants, cable television, the Internet and other modern 
campaign techniques.


But while more councilmen, mayors and freeholders are campaigning like 
legislators and members of Congress, they also are starting to have to shell 
out big bucks.


In 1995, candidates for mayor in Hamilton Township in Mercer County spent a 
combined $187,000. Last year, the campaign spending topped $415,000.


In Woodbridge, local campaigns cost $675,501 in 1999. Brick Township 
candidates sank $205,951 into their races. Cherry Hill candidates spent 
$167,078.


Combined, local and county candidates last year spent a record $17 million, 
according to a new study by ELEC. The average candidate spent $27,829, and 
total spending was up nearly 63 percent above the $11 million spent a decade 
earlier. That's comparable to the percentage increase in spending by state 
legislative candidates.


ELEC officials said local candidates have learned some of the same lessons 
as their big league counterparts. To win, you need every advantage. But 
winning can be expensive.


"There is significant financial activity at the local level, and that 
financial activity at this level is largely following trends at other levels 
of New Jersey politics," says the 53-page report.


Jeffrey Brindle, ELEC's deputy director and author of the study, said he 
examined spending by 50 randomly selected candidates to see where they got 
their money and how they spent it. More than 600 candidates ran in local 
races last year.


One finding was that 76 percent of all of local donations came from party 
organizations, mostly county and municipal. Another 10 percent came from 
business interests, 9 percent from individuals, and smaller amounts were 
from unions and political action committees.


The dominance of local parties, Brindle said, is due "in part to the fact 
that many local candidates are newly recruited to run for public office, and 
are dependent on local party organizations to undertake the everyday tasks 
of running a campaign."


By contrast, state legislators received just 17 percent of their donations 
from political parties. They can draw on contributors from a much larger 
area, and, unlike local candidates, tend to get financial help from 
colleagues in safe districts or leadership posts.


"In general, local candidates tap those individuals and businesses within 
the local area. Incumbent legislators, in particular, draw up Trenton 
lobbyists, legislative leadership committees and state party committees," 
the report says.


Brindle also found that 68 percent of the expenditures were for mass 
communication, primarily pamphlets mailed to the homes of voters.


"Of the dollars spent on mass communications, 80 percent was directed toward 
print advertising, with the majority of those expenditures committed to 
direct mail," he said.


William Dressel, executive director of the New Jersey League of 
Municipalities, said local officials regularly lament the surging cost of 
campaigns. But they also have asked the league to sponsor regular seminars 
for campaign advice, such as how to use Census data and e-mail to target 
voters.


"This isn't just door-knocking or working the crowd at the county fair 
anymore," he said. "These are really sophisticated campaign efforts that 
emulate state and federal campaigns, and one consequence is it is costing 
more."


Garabed "Chuck" Haytaian, chairman of the Republican State Committee, said 
he often is impressed by political novices these days because they seem 
better prepared than challengers a decade ago.


"They are much more informed, and I think a lot of that is because of the 
Internet," he said.


Star-Ledger staff writer Towanda Underdue contributed to this report.

Message:


I restrained myself from quoting the whole message.  Let me just 
respond to one point that I think is important ...

Okay, the problem here is differentiating between 1) The relationship 
between capitalism and fascism at the time of the _creation_ of a 
dictatorship ... versus 2) The relationship between capitalism and 
fascism after the dictatorship has been fully established.  In other 
words, do _capitalists_ intend a dictatorship (1) or do they (2) 
merely adapt opportunistically to the dictatorship once it is 
established?  

Historically, capitalism adapted comfortably and happily to Fascism.  
But fascism was never intended by the 'big bourgeoisie'.  Especially 
in Germany.  I'll briefly list the following articles of proof with 
respect to the Nazis:

1)  The power to appoint the Chancellor (in 1933) stood with a tiny 
clique of isolated individuals surrounding the aging President 
Hindenberg.  These included a few trusted old military figures and 
Hindenberg's son.  Hitler's ascension to power was indeed determined 
by very contingent political factors, by human choices.  A military 
dictatorship was all but fated; a Nazi dictatorship was not.  The 
last Chancellor before Hitler, Kurt von Schleicher, could have rather 
easily lead a military coup, and there might have never been a Nazi 
dictatorship.  In fact, he seriously considered doing so.    

2)  The 'big bourgeoisie' mostly opposed the Nazis, at worst 
supporting the more authoritarian of the basically liberal (if not 
fully democratic) parties.  THIS is an important point:  there may 
have been an element of elitism on the part of many industrialists.  
But this elitism, paradoxically, looked down upon the Antisemitism of 
the Fascists as vulgar, ugly and stupid.  It may have even been 
viewed as a phenomenon of 'mob rule'.  

3)  Many of the industrialists were at the head of industries that 
benefitted from free trade policies.  The Nazis were shrill in their 
condemnation of 'free trade'.  

4)  Exceedingly detailed research has been done on how the Nazi party 
was funded.  All records point to a mass-based funding model much 
like the Communists and Social Democrats, with greater reliance on 
money collected from party rallies (which were much more spectacular 
than those of the SPD or CP).  Industrialists contributed almost 
nothing; when they contributed at all, it was very late in the game, 
and only as a kind of desperate bribe.  Only one steel magnate, a man 
by the name of Fritz Thyssen, openly supported and contributed to the 
Nazis.  In 1934, he recanted and fled the country.  

There is only one argument that would seem at all logical.  It's a 
bit roundabout.  

Industrialists during the Weimar period did _not_ contribute to the 
Nazis, generally, nor support them.  They _did_, however, contribute 
to the liberal parties, the left-liberal DDP and the right-liberal 
DVP, in particular.  In the late 20's, they began to cut back their 
funding, because they found that they were entirely unable to 
influence the nation's economic policy through their support of, and 
contributions to, these parties.  This helped lead to the collapse of 
the centrist parties, and thereby the parties that frequently aligned 
with the SPD to neutralize the Nazis. It also led to the effective 
collapse of parliamentary rule.  But this hardly amounts to saying 
that the bourgeoisie wanted fascism.  

Otherwise, yes, the bourgeoisie adapted to Fascism just fine.  But 
Fascism is primarily political; it means the primacy of politics over 
economics, not the other way around.  

Bye,

Jeremy
