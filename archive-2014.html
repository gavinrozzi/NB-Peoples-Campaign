GERARDO HERNANDEZ NORDELO NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT!



United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navenethem Pillay has met with Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva, two of the wives of the Cuban 5, and has stated that she will intercede on 
their behalf. 


Now that Rene Gonzalez has renounced his 
citizenship and is completing the remainder of his parole in Cuba with 
his wife Olga Salanueva, this means Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo is the 
only member of the Cuban 5 who has not seen his wife. 

For the 
past 15 years Gerardo Hernandez‚Äôs wife, Adriana Perez, hasn‚Äôt been 
allowed to visit him.¬† The U.S. asserts that she is a risk to national security, despite the fact that the U.S. government has no proof or rationale to 
justify this belief.¬† This separation is a violation of Gerardo‚Äôs civil 
and international rights as a prisoner.


Mail or Fax Ms. Pillay the Project's Letter and hold her accountable to her public statement of support.¬† Remind her that the U.S. community supports the Cuban 5 and their wives' visitation rights.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for the case of the Cuban Five
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, 
yesterday, Olga Salanueva, spouse of Ren√© Gonz√°lez, and Adriana P√©rez, 
spouse of Gerardo Hern√°ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and 
Olga explained to the High Commissioner the necessity that this 
organization intercedes in a direct manner on behalf of the case of the 
Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while they requested their support
 in order to be granted visas to entry the United States to visit their 
husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime 
endured by Rene constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with 
any purpose and unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and 
reunite his relatives. Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that 
requires the political willingness and ethics of the United States Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a violation to the human rights and expressed this cannot constitute an additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to this fight and her intention 
to do whatever is possible to find a solution to the case.

AGAINST ECONOMIC CRISIS... 

ABOUT THE WEC 

The World Economic Council - WEC - was founded 01.05.2009 in Oslo. The
practical administration of WEC is taken care of by the IIFOR staff and the
secretariate of the Libertarian* International, mainly located in Oslo,
Norway. The postal address is WEC P.O.B. 4777 Sofienberg N- 0506 Oslo -
Norway. The purpose of WEC is to make advice to international media,
mandated persons and people in general to a) solve economic crisis problems
and b) achieve environmentally sustainable economic growth with full
employment world wide, and c) support libertarian actions and dialog to
achieve a) and b). The basis is the practical and theoretical framework
presented at the links above, especially the General Theory of Economics,
i.e. libertarian economics. The Web-page of WEC presents updated material
related to a), b) and c), the newest on top. 

Cogrips-models and Cogrips-policy, rooted back to economical Nobel Prize
winner and social-individualist anarchist Ragnar Frisch, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt; The unenlightened plutarchy with links,
are an important part of the basis for WEC's analysis, advice and other
actions. These models and policy are an efficient alternative to
Keynes-models and the increasingly inefficient Keynesian economic policy of
our time -- regarding optimal demand management broadly defined, against
economic crisis and in general. The Keynes-paradigm is falling... Long live
Cogrips-models and Cogrips policy! 

An economic-political system with significant unemployment is in general
neither efficient, i.e. Pareto-optimal, nor fair, as defined by
libertarians. Libertarian political economy includes efficient and fair
solutions, with a.o.t. full employment and green/environmental issues fully
taken into account. Theoretically, as a special case, the unenlightened
plutarchy can have about full employment, but not in general and also
looking at history and the longer run this case can be practically ruled
out.

The libertarians and WEC are against, and do and support
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; direct actions against top heavy
societal pyramids, economical and/or political/administrative -- cut
bureaucracy costs -- increase the demand of the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people -- the people seen as a class as
opposed to the superiors in rank and/or income -- for full employment --
against the unenlightend plutarchy of several systems, IMF, WB, euro and US
$. Troubled economies in Europe should leave the euro and the Euro-zone,
this will make proper demand management more easy. 

In general it must pay to work, for the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt;
people. More information about the fight against the unenlightened plutarchy
- and for full employment, see especially
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ija132.html&gt; No to euro - Full employment - Anarchist
vs bureaucracy economics - IJA 1 (32),  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/wec.html&gt; the
WEC resolutions,  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt; The unenlightened
plutarchy,  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/aneco1.html&gt; The general theory of
anarchist economics and  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/iwwai.html&gt; International
Workers of the World. More information about the best alternative to the
unenlightened plutarchy, i.e. real democracy and horizontal organization,
see  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; System theory,
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; Real democracy,
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; Industrial organization and
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/horizon1.html&gt; Horizontal organization - a brief
survey.

The libertarians including WEC call for an end of the present mostly
inefficient and unfair political economical situations world wide, and a
steady and orderly movement of the societal, i.e. economic and
political/administrative - systems towards
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; real democracy, i.e.
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; libertarian, and continued
increased  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; libertarian degree,
see  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; System theory - Chapter V. B.! A
development towards  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; real
democracy and more of it must be done by the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people's actions - more and more, i.e.
act with dignity, use real matter of fact arguments and add weight behind
via  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; direct actions, including
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; mass
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; actions &amp;
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; industrial actions, and via
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; organization,  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt;

Increased demand is the key factor for solving the economic crisis.

May Day 2012 Manifesto by IWW 
WEC calls for a small global tax on international exchange and consentration
on national demand growth world wide 
Most of the OECD countries are ruled by the unenlightened plutarchy with
economic depression. 
Keynes is out. Only Cogrips-policy can create full employment!
The real unemployment rate may be 40% higher than the official registered
unemployment rate in 2011 and the difference may be increasing
Apropos G-20 Seoul: world export = import; correcting imbalances in 
trade will not solve the depression problem, a big hike in world total
demand will
The solution: Quantitative easing for the people - not the bureaucracy!
The unenlightened plutarchy scenario is becoming a reality in the USA -
Unfortunately Obama and USA don't follow the advice from the WEC and must

G20 Finance Ministers risk tipping the global economy into a 'double-dip'
depression 
WEC: Trillion-dollar euro rescue won't solve the low growth and depression
problem, but it is a small step in the right direction
From recession to depression - Depression is per definition equal to or more
than 5% unemployment ratio 
No to the precept: 'socialize the losses and privatize profits' 
What must be done to achieve 3.3% unemployment: Create large funds in USA
and the Euro-zone, financed by quantitative easing, and use them to cut 
taxes and increase social welfare benefits for the people, and increase
demand 14% nominally from 2009 to 2010
WEC warns against growth in the bureaucracy - the countercyclical policy to
achieve the 3.3% unemployment scenario should benefit the people 
WEC warns about the unenlightened plutarchy scenario - Only 3% growth in
total demand nominally from 2009 to 2010 implies 
probably about 12.5% unemployment in USA, the Euro-zone and Greece in 2010 
Unemployment in the Euro-zone and Greece hit 10%. Thus WEC's US scenario for
2010 is also relevant in this case

Increased demand is the key factor for solving the economic crisis.
Demand/(pricelevel*productivity) = employment

Full employment is achieved when (1) the demand = (full
employment*productivity*pricelevel). The solution to the crisis is proper
demand management, i.e. the condition (1) fulfilled. This mainly means
increased demand by the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people via
increased purchasing power for ordinary men and women, managed by the
central administration. This is Cogrips-policy. (The Keynesian policy with
increased public consumption will not work.) With severe economic crisis
this (Cogrips-policy) includes large funds financed by quantitative easing
to finance the necessary increased demand by the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people. A correct exchange rate for the
currency is also a necessary part of proper demand management. All
libertarians should join in this call for proper demand management,
Cogrips-policy, i.e. (1) - NOW! Increased demand is the key factor for
solving the economic crisis. Demand/(pricelevel*productivity) = employment.

May Day 2012 Manifesto by IWW

The fight against the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt; unenlightened
plutarchy and  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; statism including
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; ochlarchy, and for
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; anarchy i.e.
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; real democracy, continues
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; world wide. It is more than five years since
the financial crisis hit, followed rapidly by a larger economic crisis. The
resulting shock added millions to the already teeming ranks of the jobless
and threw millions more into precarious work. Many workers have lost good
jobs and far too many have also lost the fundamental rights that went with
them. 

There is only one cause of the crisis: lack of proper demand management.
Proper demand management is more easy done in anarchy than archy, look to
Norway, but anarchy is not necessary for proper demand management. The main
player in demand management is the central administration be it anarchist or
archist. The most efficient demand management is Cogrips-policy, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/wec.html&gt; the WEC resolutions. We call for
Cogrips-policy world wide for proper demand management and the end of the
economic crisis. Source: International Workers of the World 28.04.2012.

Most of the OECD countries are ruled by the unenlightened plutarchy with
economic depression. Keynes is out. Probably only Cogrips-models and -policy
can create full employment in 2011-12-13! New York Times 07.01.2011 stated
that "Slow job growth dims expectation of early revival" in USA, continuing
"The year 2010 ended on a disappointing note, as the economy added just
103,000 jobs in December, suggesting that economic deliverance will not
arrive with a great pop in employment. Signs still point to a long slog of a
recovery, with the unemployment rate likely to remain above 8 percent ó  it
sits at 9.4 percent after Friday's report ó at least through the rest of the
president's four-year term... The unemployment rate, which is based on a
separate survey of households, fell from 9.8 percent in November, though a
substantial part of that drop is caused by Americans leaving the work
force." See

WEC's unenlightened plutarchy scenario with forecasts for a.o.t.
unemployment in 2010, see below, became approximately a reality in several
of the OECD countries, say, in the Euro-zone at large, and in the USA. The
official registered unemployment rates (based on surveys with statistical
errors), were about 10% but would have been higher if discouraged people had
not left the workforce. The real unemployment rates may thus be much higher
than about 10 percent, perhaps about 12.5 percent in several OECD countries,
as indicated by WEC. The OECD unemployment statistics mainly confirm this
analysis of WEC and IIFOR, see
&lt;http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=MEILABOUR&gt; OECD - Labour and
unemployment statistics. The Anarchy of Norway had the lowest unemployment
rate in Europe in 2010, mainly due to an economic policy compatible with
Cogrips-models and Cogrips-policy. 

As mentioned, probably only Cogrips-models and -policy can create full
employment in 2011-12-13, see the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt;
Basic ideas of Ragnar Frisch with links. Economic Nobel Prize winner Ragnar
Frisch made the first attempts to create Cogrips-models and -policy, and
todays' Cogrips-models and -policy are inspired by these works by Frisch.
Cogrips-models and -policy are mainly compatible with libertarian economics,
as opposed to bureaucracy economics, see, say,

The real unemployment rate may be 40% higher than the official registered
unemployment rate 
in 2011 and the difference may be increasing

The OECD, UN and national statistics first and foremost present the official
registered unemployment rates. These numbers are per 2011 depressingly
large, more than 5 percent -- indicating economic depression, in most
OECD-countries. However especially in times of economic crisis, these
figures most likely severely under-counts the true number of unemployed. For
instance, the official registered unemployment rate doesn't count 1. those
people who don't have a job and have given up looking for one, or 2. those
who have found marginal part-time work but still can't make ends meet and
are still looking for more work or a full-time job. Some countries present
alternative measures of labor underutilization, such as USA. In the US these
concepts include: 

1.1. Persons marginally attached to the labor force, i.e. those who
currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they
want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the
past 12 months. Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached,
have given a job-market related reason for not currently looking for work. 

1.2. NB! However people that indicate that they want and are available for a
job and not have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months, are not
accounted for in the US statistics. This may be a significant number, since
the crisis started in 2008, and this figure will most likely increase over
time as long as the crisis lasts. IIFOR and WEC call those the long time
discouraged workers. 

1.3. Per definition the real unemployment ratio = [(real labor force - real
employment)/real labor force]100%. A crude estimate of the size of the real
labor force is based on same percentage of the population between 16-67
years as the registered labor force in percent of the population between
16-67 years in good economic times, say, the average for 1998-2000. The real
unemployment rate includes both the marginally attached and the long time
discouraged workers. 

1.4. In USA the official unemployment rate was 8.8 percent in March 2011.
Adding the marginally attached unemployed the rate was 10.3 percent, see
&lt;http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm&gt; US Bureau of Labor
Statistics - Table A-15. However including the long time discouraged
workers, the real unemployment rate may be, say, 12-13 percent for USA in
March 2011, perhaps even more. This is a quite conservative estimate related
to 1.3.. Thus the real unemployment rate in USA may very well be about 40
percent higher than the official registered unemployment rate in 2011, and
may be increasing toward 60 percent higher in the next years. The percentage
difference between the real unemployment rate and the official registered
unemployment rate may perhaps be about the same in other OECD-countries,
however this is mainly a question of further research, a.o.t. based on 1.3..


2. Persons employed part time for economic reasons, i.e. those who want and
are available for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time
schedule. This is more a question of underemployment than unemployment.
However adding those, but not  the long time discouraged workers, the
underemployment rate was 15.7 percent in USA for March 2011. Adding the long
time discouraged workers, the underemployment rate may be 17.5-18.5 per cent
in USA for March 2011. Source: WEC 08.04.2011. 

Apropos G-20 Seoul: world export = import; correcting imbalances in 
trade will not solve the depression problem, a big hike in world total
demand will

The 2010 G-20 Seoul Summit was the fifth meeting of the G-20 heads of
government, to discuss the global financial system and the world economy. It
took place in Seoul, South Korea on November 11ñ12, 2010. The headline issue
was currency war and addressing trade imbalances. Leaders were generally
unable to agree on key issues, with commentators noting the absence of the
sense of unity that had been present at summits during the worse of the
global financial crisis of 2007-2009. IMF managing director Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said this particular summit was "more of a G20 debate than a
G20 conclusion". More agreement on correcting trade balances would however
not contributed significantly to solve the crisis: World export = import;
correcting imbalances in trade will not solve the depression problem, a
sufficient hike in world total demand will. Exporting the crisis will not
solve the problem, only distribute the unemployment around the world.

The solution: Quantitative easing for the people - not the bureaucracy!

The USA (and also the Euro-countries seen all in all) is in deep economic
depression with around 10 percent unemployment-ratio. The Federal Reserve in
USA, the central bank, is in the autumn 2010 doing quantitative easing, i.e.
creating fresh money, for the bureaucracy in the USA. The Fed is not
directing the fresh money directly to the people, seen as a class as opposed
to the superiors in rank and/or income [i.e. the bureaucracy broadly
defined], and thus creating optimal increased demand by the people. The
Fed's monetary policy type quantitative easing is thus bureaucracy
economics, not anarchist economics. 

The fresh money from the Fed will probably a) partly fall into the well
known "liquidity trap", b) partly create increased profitmargin to the
bureaucracy, and inflation, especially later on (and thus be a "hidden
tax"), c) partly be spent on too high, disoptimal, public consumption, may
be with "crowding out" effects, etc. and thus not create an optimal increase
in the demand from and for the people. 

The quantitative easing shold not be combined with traditional Keynesian
monetary policy, but should be combined with libertarian fiscal and
financial policy. Say, give a lump sum gift directly to the people, or cut
taxes for the people, and similar. That will be consistent with anarchist
economics. Stop the Fed's monetary policy type bureaucracy economics
quantitative easing, it will not work optimal. Instead, in short:
Quantitative easing for the people - not the bureaucracy! Sources: WEC and

The unenlightened plutarchy scenario is becoming a reality in the USA -
Unfortunately Obama and USA don't follow the advice from the WEC and must
face the music

Gloomy picture for the people in the USA. More Americans fell into
foreclosure in July as a sour job market kept them from making payments, and
banks took over homes at a near record pace. Registered unemployment held at
9.5 percent in July but would have been higher if discouraged people had not
left the workforce. The real unemploymentrate may thus be much higher than
9.5 percent. Pessimism over the economy is rising and the grim mood could
hurt both parties in the November 2 congressional elections, according to an
NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday 11.08.2010. Almost
two-thirds of Americans believe the economy will worsen before it gets
better, up from 53 percent who felt that way in January, the poll found. 

Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed said the country is headed in the wrong
direction, a percentage that has held steady in NBC/WSJ polling throughout
the year. More than half of respondents said they disapprove of the way
President Barack Obama is handling the economy. The poll also found
Americans were split on Obama's overall job performance, with 48 percent
saying they disapprove and 47 saying they approve. Unfortunately Obama and
USA don't follow the advice from the WEC and must face the music. Sources:

G20 Finance Ministers risk tipping the global economy into a 'double-dip'
depression

WEC and the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/iwwai.html&gt; International Workers of the
World have attacked the outcome of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central
Bank Governors meeting in Busan, Korea, on 5 June. The G20 Finance Ministers
said they were meeting at a 'critical juncture' to secure global recovery
and address economic challenges and risks. They have failed on both counts.
Their decisions risk undermining recovery, whilst they have failed to move
forward the agenda for re-regulating financial markets.  

The message on the economic recovery represents a shift from the Finance
Ministers' April meeting where they cautioned against premature withdrawal
of stimulus measures. In Busan, the focus was on the importance of
"sustainable public finances" and the need for many countries to "accelerate
the pace of consolidation". The Finance Ministers' conclusions do not add
up. Forecasts suggest that the global economy is still on life-support from
public sector stimulus, yet the responsible of the public sectors are now
calling for a shift from supporting jobs to cutting deficits that could push
the global economy into a 'double-dip' depression. 

On financial reform, the Busan meeting failed to decide on what to do next.
The Ministers could not even agree on principles for international taxation
of banks and other financial institutions as called for by the IMF, much
less the adoption of a financial transactions tax (FTT). Nor did they find
minimum common ground for strengthening the Basel II Framework regulating
bank loans. 

The Busan meeting constitutes a setback for the G20. In the meantime, it is
working families who again and again are paying, and will continue to pay,
for the consequences of greed and irresponsible risk-taking by bankers and
financial speculators. The need for further action on jobs and re-regulating
finance is the message the global labor movement will take to the G20
Leaders meeting in Toronto at the end of the month. The unenlightened
plutarchy prevails. Sources: WEC, IWW and AIIS. 07.06.2010.

PS. 18.06.2010. Obama warns G20 leaders on budget cuts, BBC reports. Barack
Obama has warned against cutting national debts too quickly as it would put
economic recovery at risk. In a letter to G20 leaders, the US president said
that while it was important to put in place "credible plans" to cut
deficits, withdrawing economic stimulus early was dangerous. The leaders of
the world's 20 leading economies are due to meet in Toronto on 26 June. Mr
Obama said the priority of the meeting should be "to safeguard and
strengthen the recovery". "Better late than never, Obama", the WEC comments.


PPS. 27.06.2010. WEC supports the resolution "IWW protest against Toronto

International Workers of the World, etc. BBC 28.07.2010. reports: "G20
summit agrees on deficit cuts by 2013. Leaders at the G20 summit in Canada
have agreed to cut national budget deficits while endeavouring to promote
economic growth. Correspondents note that every major G20 country had
already committed to halve deficits within three years. Host Stephen Harper,
the Canadian prime minister, said that despite these cuts, short-term
economic stimulus measures would still be needed. Proposals for a global
levy on banks have been dropped, Mr Harper said. Instead, that will be left
to individual countries." The WEC declares that 1. with the policy of the
G20 Toronto meeting, and 2. not proper demand management toward full
employment as job no 1., 3. a double dip or continued economic depression is
very likely. 

PPPS. 28.06.2010. Later BBC has updated their report, Harper is now quoted
the following way: "Host Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister said
short-term stimulus measures would be needed to get economies moving... The
head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said
focussing on budget deficits was oversimplifying the problem, because the
situation differed from one country to another." A small improvement, the

counterproductive, especially when the world economy very likely is entering
a double dip depression, and with about 10% unemployment in many countries,

to or more than 5% unemployment ratio. This is certainly not the right time
for reducing surplus = deficits, but time for proper demand management.

WEC: Trillion-dollar euro rescue won't solve the low growth and depression
problem, but it is a small step in the right direction 

A $1 trillion rescue for the euro has halted market panic in its tracks for
now - but may not be enough to save the shared currency in the end. Swedish
Finance Minister Anders Borg said in advance it was vital to reach a deal.
"We now seeÖ wolf-pack behaviors [on markets] and if we will not stop these
packs, even if it is self-inflicted weakness, they will tear the weaker
countries apart." After weeks of dithering, the European Union finally put
serious money on the table to prevent its government debt crisis from
mushrooming - and sinking the euro, stocks and the global recovery. 

But the EU still needs to find ways to keep its member governments from
spending their way to bankruptcy - and disastrously handing the others the
bill, as Greece did to start the crisis. And ultimately it needs to get its
sluggish economy going if it wants to end the threat to its cherished
currency union. After frantic talks lasting into the early hours of Monday,
European officials agreed the 16 countries that use the euro would put up
some euro440 billion in loans, with the EU adding euro60 billion and the
International Monetary Fund some euro250 billion. The European Commission
would raise the money in capital markets, using guarantees from member
goverments, and lend it to crisis stricken countries so they can pay their
bills. Many questions were not answered, such as how the money would be
dispensed and on what terms. WEC declares: The trillion-dollar euro rescue
won't solve the low growth and depression problem, but it is a small step in
the right direction. Sources: WEC and AP. 10.05.2010.

From recession to depression - Depression is per definition equal to or more
than 5% unemployment ratio

Recession is a period of general economic decline; typically defined as a
decline in GDP for two or more consecutive quarters. A recession is
typically accompanied by an increase in unemployment. A recession is
generally considered less severe than a depression, and if a recession
continues long enough it is often then classified as a depression. More
precise the economy is in depression if the unemployment ratio, the number
of unemployed measured in  percent of the labor force, is equal to or more
than 5 percent. Greece, Spain, and the Euro-zone countries seen all in all,
and the USA, are at the moment in economic depression. NB! An economy may be
in depression even if it is going out of recession. Depression is typically
a function of unenlightened plutarchy.

What must be done to achieve 3.3% unemployment: Create large funds in USA

taxes and increase social welfare benefits for the people - not the

increase inflation significantly in the present situation, assuming that the

achieve the 3.3% unemployment scenario should benefit the people

As mentioned, the WEC supports the people, seen as a class as opposed to the

countercyclical fiscal and monetary measures that must be set in action to
achieve the 3.3% unemployment scenario for 2010 in USA and the Euro-zone,
including Greece, also by more quantitative easing, must not result in
growth in the bureaucracy. Especially not growth in the public bureaucracy,
and much public consumption. How this should be done, see a) "Anarchist vs
bureaucracy economics" and more at  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ija132.html&gt; IJA

WEC warns about the unenlightened plutarchy scenario - Only 3% growth in
total demand nominally from 2009 to 2010
implies probably about 12.5% unemployment in USA, the Euro-zone and Greece
in 2010 

The updated data for growth in total demand and GDP for USA, the Euro-zone
countries and Greece, indicate only marginal or no growth, and the
unemployment is about 10%. What will happen if this trend continues in 2010?

As mentioned, the WEC supports the people, seen as a class as opposed to the
superiors in rank and/or income, and says: Production is real income, not
money in the bank - you can't eat money, the things with real economical
value are produced goods and services and natural resources. GDP is real
income. In the name of the social-individualist anarchist and Nobel economic

A 3.3% unemployment scenario for 2010" - also valid for the Euro-zone
countries including Greece, but b) let the unenlightened plutarchy rule and
present trend continue, c) the following will probably happen: Only about 3%
increase in total demand nominally, and the same growth in GDP nominally,
from 2009 to 2010. 

A likely unenlightened plutarchy scenario is the following. 10% unemployment
in 2009 and probably 2% increase in the labor force from 2009 to 2010, 2%
inflation and 2% increase in average labor productivity - 3% increase in
total demand nominally from 2009 to 2010, i.e. a 0,98% increase in GDP
volume - real terms. This will result in exactly 12.65% unemployment in
2010, i.e. about 12.5%. This is not acceptable! 

This scenarioanalysis is very likely if not much more countercyclical fiscal
and monetary measures are introduced. Thus, very much more countercyclical
fiscal and monetary measures must be set in action. Let the billions roll!
Do it now Obama, EU's Euro-zone and Greece! It is important for the world
economy to get USA and the Euro-zone including Greece, on the optimal
economical track. Don't be afraid of quantitative easing in the present
situation! Source: WEC. 13.02.2010

Unemployment in the Euro-zone and Greece hit 10%. Thus WEC's US scenario for
2010 is also relevant in this case

Unemployment in the 16 countries that use the euro hit 10% in December for
the first time since the single currency was introduced in 1999, according
to Eurostat, the statistical office for the EU. Some 15.8 million people are
now out of work in the eurozone. Spain continues to have the highest
unemployment rate in the eurozone. The rate rose to 19.5% in December.
Greece's unemployment rate increased to 10.6% in November 2009, according to
the country's national statistics service, NSS. The rate rose from 9.8% in
October, and is also up from the jobless rate of 7.8% recorded a year
earlier. There are now nearly 532,000 unemployed people in the country. The
November numbers are the most up-to-date unemployment figures for Greece.
December 2009 jobless rates are available for most of the other countries in
the EU. Sources: BBC &amp; WEC. 11.02.2010.

What must be done in USA? A 3.3% unemployment scenario for 2010 

The WEC supports the people, seen as a class as opposed to the superiors in
rank and/or income, and says: Production is real income, not money in the
bank - you can't eat money, the things with real economical value are
produced goods and services and natural resources. GDP is real income. In
the name of the social-individualist anarchist and Nobel economic prize
winner Ragnar Frisch: Think real economics - not fiction/money
quasieconomics. 

The USA should follow this anarchist economical plan, or it will not get the
problems solved! - The sooner the better! The public administration should
do proper anarchist economic demand management. USA with 10% unemployment in
2009 and probably 2% increase in the labor force from 2009 to 2010, 2%
inflation and 2% increase in average labor productivity - and accounting for
more countercyclical fiscal and monetary measures - 14% increase in total
demand nominally from 2009 to 2010, i.e. a 11.8% increase in GDP volume -
real terms, will get exactly 3.32% unemployment in 2010. This is a realistic
aim, if the economy is managed properly.

This scenarioanalysis indicates that the countercyclical fiscal and monetary
measures are too small to achieve 3-4% unemployment in 2010, not to mention
full employment. Thus, much more countercyclical fiscal and monetary
measures must be set in action. Let the billions roll! Do it now Obama! It
is important for the world economy to get USA on the optimal economical
track.

WEC warns about a possible 'double-dip' recession 

The WEC has warned that the global economy could experience another downturn
- a so-called double dip recession. WEC said countries should not exit from
countercyclical fiscal and monetary policy measures that have bolstered
growth through huge amounts of stimulus packages and public sector spending.
WEC says we have to be very cautious because this recovery remains very
fragile. China and Asian economies are leading the recovery. Recovery in
advanced economies has been sluggish. Indicators as private demand and
employment are low. In most countries, growth is still supported by central
administration policies. 

For as long as you do not have private demand strong enough to offset the
need of countercyclical fiscal and monetary policy measures, you shouldn't
exit, WEC says. WEC adds that tackling high levels of public sector debt
will be a priority for many countries. Many countries upgrade their
estimates for economic growth, but it is so far not enough to do away with
the high unemployment world wide.

What is GDP? 

GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is arguably the most important of all
economic statistics as it attempts to capture the state of the economy in
one number. GDP represents the value of goods and services produced in the
country from all sections of the economy; agriculture, manufacturing,
energy, construction, the private service sector and public sector. GDP can
be measured in three ways: 

ï The value of the goods and services produced; which is known as the output
measure 

ï The value of the goods and services purchased by households, by public
sector, from overseas (export - import) and by business in terms of
investment in machinery and buildings. This is the expenditure measure, and
measures total demand for GDP.   

ï The value of the income generated mostly in terms of profits and wages;
which is known as the income measure. 

In theory all three approaches should produce the same number. In most
countries the office for national statistics publishes one single measure of
GDP, based on a best estimate using all three ways of measuring. Usually the
main interest in the GDP figures is in the quarterly [or yearly] change in
GDP in real terms - volume, that is after taking account of changes in
prices (inflation). 

The price level of GDP is measured by the GDP deflator, i.e. price index for
GDP. GDP-nominally/GDP-deflator = GDP in real terms - volume. Say, if GDP
increases 5% (= 1. 05), and the inflation is 3%, the price level increases
3% (= 1.03), from the previous period; the GDP volume, i.e. in real terms,
has increased 1.05/1.03 =  1.0194, about 1.9 %. Thus the real economic
growth is 1.9%. 

If the GDP measured in real terms is up on the previous three months, the
economy is growing. If it is negative it is contracting. And two consecutive
three-month periods of contraction mean an economy conventionally is said to
be in recession. If the price level is decreasing, i.e. the inflation is
negative, it is called deflation. Calculating a GDP estimate for all three
measures is a huge undertaking. The output measure alone - which is
considered the most accurate in the short term - involves often surveying
tens of thousands private firms and public sector. 

Usually first an early or "flash", estimate of the real growth in economic
activity is published, but this is revised as more information is gathered.
Revisions can be made as much as 18 months to two years after the first
"flash" estimate. GDP is the principal means of determining the health of
the economy and is used widely, nationally and internationally. GDP is used
internationally by the various financial bodies such as OECD, IMF, and the
World Bank to compare the performance of different economies. The European
Union also uses GDP estimates as a basis for determining different
countries' contributions to the EU budget. 

GDP per capita, the average real income per inhabitant of a country, is also
an important measure. This measure is also one among other measures in
estimation of the libertarian degree of a country, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ranking.html&gt; Ranking .

Euro-zone lending down 

Despite the fact that the European Central Bank is lending billions of euros
to commercial banks it seems that money is not getting into the real
economy. The latest figures show the Euro-zone money supply posted a
surprise drop in November. Banks continue to be reluctant to make loans to
individuals and companies. The amount of money loaned was down for the third
month running in November. (30.12.2009. Euronews)

Quarter of people say capitalism fatally flawed 

Nearly a quarter of people across 27 countries worldwide believe free market
capitalism is fatally flawed, according to a poll published on to mark 20
years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The fall of the Wall, which
separated communist East Germany from capitalist West Germany for nearly 30
years, was seen as a pivotal moment in the collapse of the communist bloc
and a triumph for the free market system. The survey, carried out by
GlobeScan for the BBC World Service, found an average of just 11 percent of
the more than 29,000 people surveyed between June 19 and October 13 believed
capitalism worked well and did not think greater regulation was needed. 

On average, 23 percent of people felt capitalism was fatally flawed and a
new economic system was needed, although they did not specify which
alternative they favored. Anarchism, as in Norway and Switzerland, or a
system with higher degree of anarchy, is a realistic and progressive
alternative to marxism, populism/fascism and liberalism. Around half said
the problems with capitalism could be addressed through regulation and
reform. The United States and Pakistan were the only two countries where
more than one in five felt capitalism worked well as it stands. "It appears
that the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 may not have been the crushing
victory for free-market capitalism that it seemed at the time," said Doug
Miller, GlobeScan chairman. "Particularly after the events of the last 12
months." 

The global economic crisis, which has hit many former communist eastern
European countries hard, has prompted many people to question the merits of
the capitalist approach. The survey showed some features of socialism, such
as equalizing wealth, continued to appeal to many. In 22 of the countries, a
majority of people supported the idea of governments distributing wealth
more evenly. In 15 countries a majority said they would like their
government to be more active in owning or directly controlling their
country's major industries -- a view particularly widely held in the former
Soviet states of Russia and Ukraine. Among former Warsaw Pact countries, the
majority of Russians and Ukrainians said the break up of the Soviet Union
was a bad thing. By contrast four in five Poles and nearly two-thirds of
Czechs felt the disintegration of the USSR was a good thing. (08.11.2009.
Reuters, WEC, AIIS)

Support the Cuban 5 Visa Campaign:
Gerardo Hernandez Needs our Support!


United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navenethem Pillay has met with Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva, two of the wives of the Cuban 5, and has stated that she will intercede on 
their behalf. 

Now that Rene Gonzalez has renounced his 
citizenship and is completing the remainder of his parole in Cuba with 
his wife Olga Salanueva, this means Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo is the 
only member of the Cuban 5 who has not seen his wife. 

For the 
past 14 years Gerardo Hernandez‚Äôs wife, Adriana Perez, hasn‚Äôt been 
allowed to visit him.¬† The U.S. asserts that she is a risk to national security, despite the fact that the U.S. government has no proof or rationale to 
justify this belief.¬† This separation is a violation of Gerardo‚Äôs civil 
and 
international rights as a prisoner.

Mail or Fax Ms. Pillay the Project's Letter and hold her accountable to her public statement of support.¬† 
Remind her that the U.S. community supports the Cuban 5 and their wives' visitation rights.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for the case of the Cuban Five
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, 
yesterday, Olga Salanueva, spouse of Ren√© Gonz√°lez, and Adriana P√©rez, 
spouse of Gerardo Hern√°ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and 
Olga explained to the High Commissioner the necessity that this 
organization intercedes in a direct manner on behalf of the case of the 
Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while they requested their support
 in order to be granted visas to entry the United States to visit their 
husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime 
endured by Rene constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with 
any purpose and unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and 
reunite his relatives. Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that 
requires the political willingness and ethics of the United States Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a violation to the human rights and expressed this cannot constitute an additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to this fight and her intention 
to do whatever is possible to find a solution to the case.

Manifeste AnarchofÈministe 


Anarchafeminist Manifesto 


Translated from French (Bulletin C.R.I.F.A. No 44 mars -avril 1983 p. 12,
and Le Monde Libertaire, no 479 - 1983 p. 9 )

  _____  


All over the world most women have no rights whatsoever to decide upon
important matters which concern their lives. Women suffer from oppressions
of two kinds: 1) the general social oppression of the people, and 2)
secondly sexism - oppression and discrimination because of their sex. 

There are five main forms of oppression: 

- Ideological oppression, brainwash by certain cultural traditions,
religion, advertising and propaganda. Manipulation with concepts and play
upon women's feelings and susceptibilities. Widespread patriarchal and
authoritarian attitudes and capitalistic mentality in all areas. 

- State oppression, hierarchical forms of organization with command lines
downwards from the top in most interpersonal relations, also in the
so-called private life . 

- Economic exploitation and repression, as a consumer and a worker in the
home and in low-salary women's jobs . 

- Violence, under the auspices of the society as well as in the private
sphere - indirectly when there is coercion because of lack of alternatives
and direct physical violence. 

- Lack of organization, tyranny of the structurelessness which pulverizes
responsibility and creates weakness and inactivity. 

These factors work together and contribute simultaneously to sustain each
other in a vicious circle. There is no panacea to break the circle, but it
isn't unbreakable. 

Anarcha-feminism is a matter of consciousness. The consciousness which puts
guardians off work. The principles of a liberating society thus stand
perfectly clear to us. 

Anarcha-feminism means women's independence and freedom on an equal footing
with men. A social organization and a social life where no-one is superior
or inferior to anyone and everybody is coordinate, women as well as men.
This goes for all levels of social life, also the private sphere.

Anarcha-feminism implies that women themselves decide and take care of their
own matters, individually in personal matters, and together with other women
in matters which concern several women. In matters which concern both sexes
essentially and concretely women and men shall decide on an equal footing.

Women must have self-decision over their own bodies, and all matters
concerning contraception and childbirth are to be decided upon by women
themselves.

It must be fought both individually and collectively against male
domination, attitudes of ownership and control over women, against
repressive laws and for women's economic and social autonomy and
independence. 

Crisis centers, day care centers, study and discussion groups, women's
culture activities etc. must be established, and be run under womens's own
direction. 

The traditional patriarchal nuclear family should be replaced by free
associations between men and women based on equal right to decide for both
parts and with respect for the individual person's autonomy and integrity. 

Sex-stereotyping in education, media and at the place of work must be
abolished. Radical sharing of the work by the sexes in ordinary jobs,
domestic life and education is a suitable mean. 

The structure of working life must be radically changed, with more part-time
work and flat organized cooperation at home as well as in society. The
difference between men's work and women's work must be abolished. Nursing
and taking care of the children must concern men just as much as women. 

Female power and female prime ministers will neither lead the majority of
women to their ends nor abolish oppression. Marxist and bourgeoisie
feminists are misleading the fight for women's liberation. For most women it
is not going to be any feminism without anarchism. In other words,
anarcha-feminism does not stand for female power or female prime ministers,
it stands for organization without power and without prime ministers. 

The double oppression of women demands a double fight and double organizing:
on the one hand in feminist federations, on the other hand in the
organizations of anarchists. The anarcha-feminists form a junction in this
double organizing. 

A serious anarchism must also be feminist otherwise it is a question of
patriarchal half-anarchism and not real anarchism. It is the task of the
anarcha-feminists to secure the feminist feature in anarchism. There will be
no anarchism without feminism. 

An essential point in anarcha-feminism is that the changes must begin today,
not tomorrow or after the revolution. The revolution shall be permanent. We
must start today by seeing through the oppression in the daily life and do
something to break the pattern here and now. 

We must act autonomously, without delegating to any leaders the right to
decide what we wish and what we shall do: we must make decisions all by
ourselves in personal matters, together with other women in pure female
matters, and together with the male fellows in common matters.

***********

The origin of the Anarchafeminist Manifesto. 

8 March, International Women's Day, is a special relevant day to remember
the Anarchafeminist Manifesto. The origin of the Anarchafeminist Manifesto
is in Norway. The Anarchafeminist Manifesto is the summary of the feminist
political program unanimously agreed upon by the third congress of the
Anarchist Federation of Norway 1 - 7 of June 1982. The manifesto was first
published in Norwegian in Folkebladet (IJA) no 1 1983 pp. 4-5. Soon after
the Manifesto was published in CRIFA-Bulletin no 44 mars-avril 1983 in
French (p. 12) and English (p. 13) language. Later on the French version was
used as the basis for a translation to English that was published on the
Internet, see above. The Manifesto is also translated  to other languages. 

Anarchafeminst Greetings from Anna Quist, co-writer of the Anarchafeminst
Manifesto.

Anarka-feministene


http://www.anarchy.no/anfem.png


(anarkistiske feminister, feministiske anarkister, anarko-feminister) 


Anarka-feminismen har sine r¯tter helt tilbake til 1800-tallet, hvor Emma
Goldmans ideer sto sentralt, jevnf¯r: Emma Goldman: KjÊrlighet eller
ekteskap? Anarkistisk lesebok, PAX 1970. 

I Norge var den anarkistiske kvinnegruppen "Samhold" aktiv bÂde f¯r og etter
andre verdenskrig, se artikkelen "Anarko-feministene " Sentralposten nr 3
2005, forfattet av Harald Fagerhus. Se ogsÂ http://www.fagerhus.no/a_Norge/
&lt;http://www.fagerhus.no/a_Norge/&gt; . 

PÂ 1960-tallet begynte ogsÂ unge anarka-feminister i Norge Â gj¯re seg
gjeldende i hvertfall fra 1966.

F¯rst var det snakk om frittstÂende individer, og deltakere i organisasjoner
med anarkistisk vinkling, ikke egne anarka-feministiske
grupper/organisasjoner. 

F¯derasjonen av Anarkistisk Ungdom, FAU, som startet opp i Kristiansund, ca
1966-67, hadde et anarka-feministisk innslag. I 1968 feiret Kultursyndikatet
pÂ ≈s den ganske anarkistiske oppstanden i Paris, med anarkismens svarte
flagg pÂ taket. Her var anarka-feminister med. Den anarkistiske delen av
Kultursyndikatet var med Â starte Anarkist-F¯derasjonen i Norge (AFIN)  -
Anarkistenes Organisasjon (ANORG) i 1977.  Mange anarka-feminister var med i
AFIN-ANORG helt fra starten. 

Folkebladet - Anarkistorganet, som ble startet opp i 1971 og fremdeles
kommer ut, hadde og har et anarka-feministisk innslag. 

Spesifikke anarka-feministiske framst¯t i Norge er kjent fra midten av
1970-Ârene. 

I 1976 ble an anarkistisk kvinnegruppe startet i Oslo, men den var kortlevd
jevnf¯r Fagerhus' bok om anarkismen og syndikalismen i Norge ca 1850 - 2000,
Anorg forlag, 2005 (ISBN 82-90468-25-3). Det ble ikke ordentlig fart pÂ den
spesifikt anarka-feministiske organiseringen f¯r AFIN-ANORG kom i gang. 

Den anarka-feministiske organisasjonen " Kj¯nnslig gruppe", KG, i AFIN-ANORG
startet i 1977. KG hadde bl.a. fri kjÊrlighet og erotisk kunst pÂ
programmet, og tok avstand fra patriarkalsk og kvinneundertrykkende porno.
KG skiftet litt senere navn til "Anarkofeminstene". Man var aktiv bl.a. med
en l¯peseddel, studier og i AFIN-ANORGs medlemsblad og noe senere med stoff
presentert i Folkebladet. Denne aktiviteten fortsetter fremdeles. 

I 1978 og 79 satte teatergruppen Graxelaget, med bandet FABS, opp
Anarko-p¯nk-operaen "Balladen om Exterazy Grax". Flere anarka-feminister
deltok, og operaen hadde ogsÂ en klart anarka-feministisk vri, bl.a. med
satire over tradisjonelle kj¯nnsroller og patriarkalske tendenser. Operaen
ble utgitt pÂ vinyl pÂ Folkebladets Anarki-label i august 1979, og dette var
Norges f¯rste p¯nke-plate med landsomfattende distribusjon. 

PÂ norsk initiativ ble Den Anarka-Feministiske Internasjonale IAF-AFI
dannet i 1982 pÂ en internasjonal kongress, og den lever i beste velgÂende
fremdeles, se http://www.anarchy.no/iaf.html .  Et viktig dokument for denne
er det Anarka-Feministiske Manifest, et sammendrag av det
anarka-feministiske programmet laget av norske anarka-feminister i 1982, se
http://www.anarchy.no/maf.html  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/maf.html&gt;  .

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5:¬†Cuban 5 Visa Campaign




We celebrate the release of Fernando Gonzalez of the Cuban 5, we must not forget the 15 years that Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo has spent separated from his wife Adriana
 Perez.¬† 

The time to act is NOW!¬† Send a letter to the High Commissioner of Human Rights Navi Pillay!¬† Ask her to intercede on Gerardo's behalf and on the behalf of the rest of the Cuban 5 who aren't allowed to see their family on a regular basis.





Support the Cuban 5 Visa Campaign:


United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navenethem Pillay has met with Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva, two of the wives of the Cuban 5, and has stated that she will intercede on 
their behalf. 

Now that Rene Gonzalez has renounced his 
citizenship and is completing the remainder of his parole in Cuba with 
his wife Olga Salanueva, this means Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo is the 
only member of the Cuban 5 who has not seen his wife. 

For the 
past 14 years Gerardo Hernandez‚Äôs wife, Adriana Perez, hasn‚Äôt been 
allowed to visit him.¬† The U.S. asserts that she is a risk to national security, despite the fact that the U.S. government has no proof or rationale to 
justify this belief.¬† This separation is a violation of Gerardo‚Äôs civil 
and 
international rights as a prisoner.

Mail or Fax Ms. Pillay the Project's Letter and hold her accountable to her public statement of support.¬† 
Remind her that the U.S. community supports the Cuban 5 and their wives' visitation rights.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for the case of the Cuban Five
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, 
yesterday, Olga Salanueva, spouse of Ren√© Gonz√°lez, and Adriana P√©rez, 
spouse of Gerardo Hern√°ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and 
Olga explained to the High Commissioner the necessity that this 
organization intercedes in a direct manner on behalf of the case of the 
Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while they requested their support
 in order to be granted visas to entry the United States to visit their 
husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime 
endured by Rene constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with 
any purpose and unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and 
reunite his relatives. Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that 
requires the political willingness and ethics of the United States Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a violation to the human rights and expressed this cannot constitute an additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to this fight and her intention 
to do whatever is possible to find a solution to the case.

17.03.2014. An overwhelming 96.7% of Crimea residents voted to secede from
Ukraine and join Russia, according to final results of Sunday's referendum.
Mikhail Malyshev, the head of the Crimean Election Commission, announced the
results in a news conference Monday. While he did not say 100% of the
ballots had been counted, he did say, "The committee's work is done." The
turnout was 83.1%: 1,274,096 of eligible voters cast their ballots. Later
Russian President Vladimir Putin signs a decree recognising Crimea "as a
sovereign and independent state", officials say. The EU and US have declared
the vote illegal and imposed sanctions. Travel bans and asset freezes have
been imposed on government officials and other figures in Russia, Crimea and
Ukraine. Pro-Russian forces have been on the streets of Crimea since late
February, though Moscow denies they are under its direct control, BBC
reports.

18.03.2014. Crimea and Sevastopol are now officially part of the Russian
Federation, the Kremlin said in a statement, citing today's signing ceremony
involving Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Prime Minister of Crimea and

Ukraine on the economic-political map - Solidarity with Ukrainian miners and
NPGK - The history 2011 - 2014


by IIFOR 29.11.2008 - Updated 

Ukraine was the center of the first eastern Slavic state, Kyivan Rus, which
during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest and most powerful state
in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels and Mongol invasions, Kyivan Rus
was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and eventually into the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan
Rus laid the foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent
centuries. A new Ukrainian state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was established
during the mid-17th century after an uprising against the Poles. Despite
continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate managed to remain autonomous
for well over 100 years. During the latter part of the 18th century, most
Ukrainian ethnographic territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire.
Following the collapse of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine was able to bring
about a short-lived period of independence (1917-20), with a.o.t. a wide
spread anarchist movement, but was reconquered and forced to endure a brutal
Soviet rule that engineered two artificial famines (1921-22 and 1932-33) in
which over 8 million died. In World War II, German and Soviet armies were
responsible for some 7 to 8 million more deaths. 

Although final independence for Ukraine was achieved in 1991 with the
dissolution of the USSR, democracy remained elusive as the legacy of state
control and endemic corruption stalled efforts at economic and political
progress and civil liberties. A peaceful mass protest, the so called "Orange
Revolution" in the closing months of 2004, forced the authorities to
overturn a rigged presidential election and to allow a new internationally
monitored vote that swept into power the nationalist-fascist Viktor
Yushchenko. Yushchenko promised reforms, but little happened. Subsequent
internal squabbles in the Yushchenko camp allowed his rival, the
left-fascist Viktor Yanukovych, to stage a comeback in parliamentary
elections and become prime minister in August of 2006. 

An early legislative election, brought on by a political crisis in the
spring of 2007, saw Yuliya Tymoshenko, as head of a right-fascist "Orange"
coalition, installed as a new prime minister in December 2007. The
left-fascist Viktor Yanukovych was elected president in a February 2010
run-off election that observers assessed as meeting most international
standards. The following month, the Rada approved a vote of no-confidence
prompting Yuliya Tymoshenko to resign from her post as prime minister.

Despite elections, Ukraine is very far from a real democracy, it has
considerable authoritarianism. (Remember also Adolf Hitler was
democratically elected...) Ukraine is a democracy in the name only, it is in
reality a totalitarian economic-political system, with no real autonomy for
the people as opposed to the upper classes, and no real socialism. 

Ukraine is bordering the Black Sea, between Poland, Romania, and Moldova in
the west and Russia in the east. Environmental problems are: Inadequate
supplies of potable water; air and water pollution; deforestation; radiation
contamination in the northeast from 1986 accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Power
Plant. Average life expectancy at birth for the total population is 68.06
years. Ethnic groups are: Ukrainian 77.8%, Russian 17.3%, Belarusian 0.6%,
Moldovan 0.5%, Crimean Tatar 0.5%, Bulgarian 0.4%, Hungarian 0.3%, Romanian
0.3%, Polish 0.3%, Jewish 0.2%, other 1.8% (2001 census). Literacy above 15
years of age is 99.4% (2001 concensus). 

The unemployment ratio is 2.3% officially registered; but there is a large
number of unregistered or underemployed workers; the International Labor
Organization calculates that Ukraine's real unemployment level is nearly 7%
(2007 est.). Official (and probably far too low) estimates of the
unemployment rates were 8.8% in 2009 and 8.4% in 2010. Gininindex, offical
estimate, is 29 (2003), 31 (2006), however widespread corruption indicates a
real Gini-index above 35. Population below poverty line was 35% (2009). In
2003 the GDP per capita at current exchange rate was estimated to 1 024 US $
and  the PPP at 5 491, according to UN statistics. In 2007 the figures were
3 028 and 7 000 according to the CIA-factbook. These figures, indicating an
incredible growth rate, can hardly be trusted, but in any case the GDP per
capita is relatively low, indicating low efficiency, a typical
capitalist/economical plutarchist tendency. 

There was however some real GDP growth in 2006-07, fueled by high global
prices for steel - Ukraine's top export - and by strong domestic
consumption, spurred by rising pensions and wages. The drop in steel prices
and Ukraine's exposure to the global financial crisis due to aggressive
foreign borrowing lowered growth in 2008 and the economy contracted more
than 15% in 2009, among the worst economic performances in the world; some
growth resumed in 2010, buoyed by exports. External conditions are likely to
hamper efforts for economic recovery in 2011. 

Labor legislation incompatible with international standards remains in
place. Interference intensified in 2007-2008 both on behalf of the employers
and the authorities. Several anti-union discrimination were reported.
Although the government has made an effort to resolve some past violations,
further cases of severe  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; ochlarchy (mob
rule broadly defined), i.e. harassment, intimidation and even physical
assault, of trade union activists were reported. Labor union members are
often subject to pressure and discrimination. This includes dismissals,
transfers, demotions and deteriorating trade unionists' working conditions. 

The figures and other data are quite uncertain, but all in all indicating a
system with very large rank differences - and large, but somewhat less
income differences, and it is relatively inefficient. The degree of
capitalism is estimated to about 50,1% and the degree of statism is
estimated to 82,6%, and thus the authoritarian degree is about 68,3%, and
the libertarian degree about 31,7% . This is indicating a totalitarian left
fascist system on the economic-political map. Totalitarian societies have
systems with more than 66,7 % authoritarian degree. The system in Ukraine is
however somewhat less authoritarian than in Georgia. 

Solidarity with Ukrainian miners and NPGK

The authorities of Ukraine, political/adminstrative and/or economically,
i.e. the capitalists/economical  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt;
plutarchists, continue to attack the rights of the working class and
independent labor confederations. The working
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; class is the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people, seen as a
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; class as opposed to the superiors, the
authorities, political/administrative and/or economically, i.e. in rank
and/or income/wealth. 

One of the independent labor confederations being severely attacked is the
Independent Trade Union of Miners of Krivbass (NPGK), operating in the
Dnipropetrovsk region, primarily in the mine "October" Krivoy Rog iron ore
(KZhRK). The union brought together nearly 500 miners and actively defended
the interests of the workers. However NPGK's main secretary Nikita Stotsky
has not given in, he has already passed two dozen trials, requiring
compliance with the legal rights of NPGK, and challenging the rulers, i.e.
the administration and owners, of KZhRK. 

The rulers of KZhRK, of which several are members or recently were the
deputies of local authorities from the nationalist-fascist party "Our
Ukraine", headed by former President Viktor Yushchenko, have actively
supported the union leadership of NPGU. This corrupt union, NPGU, is closely
associated with one of the largest financial and political groups in
Ukraine, the right-fascist team around Yulia Tymoshenko, and is conducting
an active policy of supporting "their" businessmen and politicians. On this
background, the rulers of KZhRK and the bosses of NPGU by force seized the
office of NPGK with all union possessions. 

Hundreds of workers at KZHRK are struggling to restore the rights of their
independent trade union. But the rulers, i.e. the company management, local
government and the corrupt courts, do not back down. The International
Workers of the World (IWW) demands that the rulers of "October" Krivoy Rog
iron ore (KZhRK) restore all legitimate rights of NPGK, stop interfering in
union activities, and return the union's rightful possessions! Hands off
NPGK's main secretary Nikita Stotsky! 

The  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/iwwai.html&gt; International Workers of the World
and its Ukrainian section call for an end of the present
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; totalitarian left fascist regime with
severe  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; ochlarchy in Ukraine, and a steady
and orderly movement of the social, i.e. economic and
political/administrative - system towards
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; real democracy, i.e.
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; anarchy - a real revolution and a
velvet revolution; and continued increased
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; libertarian degree, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; System theory - Chapter V. B.! 

A development towards  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; real
democracy must be done by the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people's
actions - more and more, i.e. act with dignity, use real matter of fact
arguments and add weight behind via
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; direct actions, including
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; mass
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; actions &amp;
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; industrial actions, and via
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; organization,  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt;
dialog and  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; elections! Junctions
in this connection are the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/iwwai.html&gt; International
Workers of the World and its Ukrainian section, as well as the independent
labor movement in Ukraine in general, e.g. the Coordination Council of
Workers' Movement of Ukraine (KSRD). This resolution is sent to a) the
Ukrainian authorities, b) to international newsmedia and mandated persons in
general, and c) to anarchists and syndicalists etc. world wide, 28.04.2011.

The history 2011 - 2014


During Yanukovych's term he has been accused of tightening of press
restrictions and a renewed effort in the parliament to limit freedom of
assembly. When young, Yanukovych was sentenced to 3 years because of theft,
looting and vandalism and later had his sentenced doubled. One
frequently-cited example of Yankukovych's alleged attempts to centralize
power is the August 2011 arrest of Yulia Tymoshenko. Other high-profile
political opponents also came under criminal investigation since. On 11
October 2011, a Ukrainian court sentenced Tymoshenko to seven years in
prison after she was found guilty of abuse of office when brokering the 2009
gas deal with Russia. The conviction is seen as "justice being applied
selectively under political motivation" by the European Union and other
international organizations.

In November 2013, President Yanukovych did not sign the Ukraine-European
Union Association Agreement and instead pursued closer ties with Russia.
This move sparked protests on the streets of Kiev. Protesters set up camps
in Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), and in December2013 and
January 2014 protesters started taking over various government buildings,
first in Kiev and, later, in Western Ukraine. Different types of people and
organizations participated in the demonstrations. Also a few anarchists
participated in the protests, but also neo-nazi extremists. A strange mix.
Battles between protesters and police resulted in about 80 deaths in
February 2014.

Following the violent suppression of the Maidan protestors, the Parliament
turned against Yanukovych and on February 22 voted to remove him from power,
and to free Yulia Tymoshenko from prison. The same day Yanukovych supporter
Volodymyr Rybak resigned as speaker of the Parliament, and was replaced by
Tymoshenko loyalist Oleksandr Turchynov, who was subsequently installed as
interim President. Yanukovych fled Kiev and moved to Russia, which in turn
has strengthened its military presence in the south of Ukraine. The degree
of capitalism and statism have not changed significantly so far, the system
is still left fascist on the economic-political map. The protests at Maidan
continue. The Anarchist International declares: No war among nations - no
peace between classes. No to EU for Ukraine. No to Russian occupation. No
NATO-membership for Ukraine. No to neo-nazis and their extremist militias.
For a movement towards real democracy, i.e. anarchy, in Ukraine. 05.03.2014.

06.03.2014. President Barack Obama said today that a proposed referendum for
Crimea to join Russia would violate the Ukrainian Constitution and
international law. Obama said he is "confident" that the international
community is "moving forward together" in responding to the crisis in
Ukraine.

08.03.2014. Crimea, located south in Ukraine, has fast-tracked preparations
for the republic's referendum and for its possible joining with Russia,
statements from the autonomy's leaders reveal. Though no decision has been
made by Moscow, they say Crimea may be part of Russia by late March.
Earlier, on Friday, Grigory Ioffe, first deputy chair of the region's
parliament, stressed that the "historic" referendum will be "very democratic
and open" and will be held "in full compliance" with both the Ukrainian
constitution and the international treaties that Ukraine had adopted. 

15.03.2014. Ad the referendum in Crimea 16.03.2014. The anarchists say No to
Moscow with authoritarian, nationalist social-democracy, and No to Kiev with
left-fascism included neo-nazis in the government. For an independent
republic in Crimea, homeland to among others the Crimean tatars.

16.03.2014. Referendum in Crimea. Polls have opened in a referendum on the
peninsula of Crimea, in which voters are to voice their wish to either join
Russia or become an effectively independent state connected to Ukraine, CNN
reports.

17.03.2014. An overwhelming 96.7% of Crimea residents voted to secede from
Ukraine and join Russia, according to final results of Sunday's referendum.
Mikhail Malyshev, the head of the Crimean Election Commission, announced the

&gt;The  Federation of Cuban Women, or the FMC (La Federacion de Mujeres  Cubanas), has been essential in advancing both gender equalization and  health improvement for women. The FMC is recognized as both an NGO and a national mechanism for women,  because while its membership includes the vast majority of Cuban women  (85.2% of all eligible women over 14), it is not government supported or  financed.
&gt;
&gt;†
&gt;Some  of the FMC's most important achievements have been supporting the mass  education of women, incorporating women into the work force, and pushing  for legislation and social reform for gender equality.

Support the Cuban 5 Visa Campaign:


United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navenethem Pillay has met with Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva, two of the wives of the Cuban 5, and has stated that she will intercede on 
their behalf. 

Now that Rene Gonzalez has renounced his 
citizenship and is completing the remainder of his parole in Cuba with 
his wife Olga Salanueva, this means Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo is the 
only member of the Cuban 5 who has not seen his wife. 

For the 
past 14 years Gerardo Hernandez‚Äôs wife, Adriana Perez, hasn‚Äôt been 
allowed to visit him.¬† The U.S. asserts that she is a risk to national security, despite the fact that the U.S. government has no proof or rationale to 
justify this belief.¬† This separation is a violation of Gerardo‚Äôs civil 
and 
international rights as a prisoner.

Mail or Fax Ms. Pillay the Project's Letter and hold her accountable to her public statement of support.¬† 
Remind her that the U.S. community supports the Cuban 5 and their wives' visitation rights.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for the case of the Cuban Five
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, 
yesterday, Olga Salanueva, spouse of Ren√© Gonz√°lez, and Adriana P√©rez, 
spouse of Gerardo Hern√°ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and 
Olga explained to the High Commissioner the necessity that this 
organization intercedes in a direct manner on behalf of the case of the 
Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while they requested their support
 in order to be granted visas to entry the United States to visit their 
husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime 
endured by Rene constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with 
any purpose and unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and 
reunite his relatives. Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that 
requires the political willingness and ethics of the United States Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a violation to the human rights and expressed this cannot constitute an additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to this fight and her intention 
to do whatever is possible to find a solution to the case.

Freedom† Month is a time to raise awareness of the cases of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners and the decolonization of Puerto Rico.


Join us for these two amazing events!

May Day 2014 Manifesto 

The fight against the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt; unenlightened
plutarchy and statism &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt;  including
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; ochlarchy, and for anarchy
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt;  i.e. real democracy
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; , continues world wide
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; . It is more than seven years since the
financial crisis hit, followed rapidly by a larger economic crisis. The
resulting shock added millions to the already teeming ranks of the jobless
and threw millions more into precarious work. Many workers have lost good
jobs and far too many have also lost the fundamental rights that went with
them. 

There is only one cause of the crisis: lack of proper demand management.
Proper demand management is more easy done in anarchy than archy, look to
Norway, but anarchy is not necessary for proper demand management. The main
player in demand management is the central administration be it anarchist or
archist. The most efficient demand management is Cogrips-policy, see the WEC
resolutions &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/wec.html&gt; . We call for Cogrips-policy
world wide for proper demand management and the end of the economic crisis.

Anarchy and anarchism mean "system and management without ruler(s), i.e.
co-operation without repression, tyranny and slavery". 
In short an-arch-y = [(an = without - arch = ruler(s)) - y = system
(included optimal order and law) and management, as, say, in monarch-y]. 
Anarchy and anarchism are efficient and fair system and management without
top heavy societal pyramid, economical and/or 
political/administrative - in income and/or rank, i.e. significant
horizontal organization - real democracy. 
Anarchism is the same as anarchy but also the political tendency that
advocates anarchy and the knowledge about anarchy.
Anarchism is, a. o. t., based on dialog and free, matter of fact, criticism.

In the mostly Orwellian "1984" newspeaking, lying, world, the following lies
are also significant:
In USA, the world's largest economy, economical plutarchy, i.e. capitalism,
is falsely called economic freedom! 
In China, the country with most people in the world, a totalitarian
oligarchy is falsely called the people's democracy! 
And there are much more Orwellian "1984" newspeak type lies in the world -
many of these lies are revealed and unmasked at  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt;
www.anarchy.no!
Be enlightened and prepared for real democracy, i.e. anarchy, feel free to
study all at  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no&gt; www.anarchy.no!

The truth: the only Anarchies, i.e. anarchist countries in the world, are
Norway, The Swiss Confederation and Iceland, 
and they are only anarchies of rather low degree...

And, say, Somalia, as the newspeaking lie-machines CNN, BBC, Foxnews,
Reuters, Associated Press, Wikipedia and most of Internet in general, etc. 
falsely call 'anarchy' is in reality an ochlarchy with rivaling polyarchy,
i.e. chaos - not anarchy, and the country most far from anarchy in the
world! 
In general, x-archy, where x can be anything but not 'an', is the opposite
of freedom and real democracy, i.e. anarchy. 
The struggle for anarchy includes the struggle against x-archy, where x can

200th Anniversary of Bakunin's birth 30.05.1814. The Anarcho-Collectivist
International

http://www.anarchy.no/epwm2.gif

The Anarcho-Collectivist International, ACI, has historical roots to Michael
(Mikhail Alexandrovich) Bakunin (1814 - 1876). Bakunin's basic ideas are a
development of the Proudhonian ideas leftwards on the economic-political
map, building on his libertarian federalist ideas. Bakunin's conversion to
anarchism came in 1865, towards the end of his life. The collectivist
principle of remuneration, "from each according to ability, to each
according to the product of his labor" or similar notions, is connected to
this form of anarchism. The collectivists understood that full communism
would not be immediately realizable. At the 1868 Congress of the League for
Peace and Freedom, Bakunin called himself "collectivist", and stated: "I
want society and collective or social property to be organized from the
bottom up by way of free association, and not from the top down by means of
any authority whatsoever. In this sense I am a collectivist." In 1871
Bakunin proposed the following collectivist working hypothesis for further
discussion: "Only collective labor creates wealth. Collective wealth must be
collectively owned." 

Bakunin also proposed there would be "equal means of subsistence, support,
education, and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity, and
equal resources and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by
his own labor." He thus proposed a collectivist anarchism, in which state
and private ownership of the means of production would be abolished, and the
means of production would instead be owned collectively and controlled and
managed by the producers. Bakunin's political beliefs were based on the
interrelated concepts of liberty; socialism; federalism; atheism; and
materialism. The libertarian federalist rule "organized from the bottom up
by way of free association, and not from the top down by means of any
authority whatsoever", in the meaning of both political/administrative and
economically broadly defined, ideally or practically, i.e. significant, is
basic to anarchism in general. 

Bakunin's own original contributions to political economy broadly defined
are however limited, unfortunately he was lending an ear to Karl Marx's
pseudo-scientific economics. Bakunin however also criticized authoritarian
socialism, i.e. marxism, and especially the concept of "dictatorship of the
proletariat," which he adamantly rejected. Bakunin was also perhaps the
first to theorize a "new class" of intellectuals and administrators who
would form the bureaucratic apparatus of the state. Bakunin in 1872 argued
that the "State has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a
priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when
all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the
patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls ó or, if you will, rises
ó to the position of a machine." This is a small, but important contribution
to economic sociology, also relevant today.

Bakunin was first and foremost an excellent organizer. The Anarchist
International and its anarcho-syndicalist section the International Workers
of The World are rooted back to the in Geneva 1866 founded 1st
International's i.e. the IWMA - International Workingmen's Association's
conference at Saint-Imier, in The Swiss Confederation, 15-16.09.1872. That
is after Marx and his faction had expelled Bakunin's faction in a most
likely rigged vote at the Hague Congress of IWMA earlier in 1972. Bakunin's
faction was thus the true IWMA. At the IWMA's conference at Saint-Imier it
was decided an anarchist resolution denouncing all forms of political power,
i.e. political/administrative and economically broadly defined. Also a
solidarity and fellowship pact was decided upon by the delegates. The
resolution put forward by Michael Bakunin 16.09.1872, under the title "The
political action of the proletariate", at the Saint-Imier congress, should
not be forgotten. The Anarchist International had meetings several times
during the years passing by, first within the framework of the IWMA 1872-77,
later related to other international anarchist congresses. 

By the way, already in 1868, Bakunin joined the Geneva section of the 1st
International. The IWMA was rooted back to a meeting in London at St.
Martin's Hall in 1864, deciding on a 'General Council', but its real
founding and first congress was in Geneva in 1866. In 1869, Bakunin's Social
Democratic Alliance, SDA, was refused entry to the IWMA, on the grounds that
it was an international organization in itself, and only national
organizations were permitted membership. The SDA, not to be confused with
marxist social-democracy, dissolved and the various groups which it
comprised joined the IWMA separately. 

Anarcho-collectivism had a strong influence on anarcho-syndicalism later on.
Well known other works within the anarcho-collectivist tradition are written
by James Guillaume and later in the 1930s by Diego Abad de Santillan.
Another tendency is Nestor Makhno's council anarchism of the Russian
revolution in Ukraine. However the later "platformism" developed by Peter A.
Arshinov, an associate of Makhno, who went over the border to marxism on the
Economical-Political Map and joined the Bolsheviks, must be rejected as not
being anarchism, but in reality being semilibertarian or authoritarian
marxism. M. Bakunin's left Hegelian dialectical statements are also
principally rejected as pseudo-science by Kropotkin and later anarchists,
but several of Bakunin's other ideas are still valid as anarchist working
hypothesis. 

Bakunin's 1. dialectical style with tendencies of contradictions and
bombastic slogans, and 2. that most of Bakunin's works are fragmented,
unfinished and disjointed, mean 3. Bakunin should always be interpreted as
much as possible in the full context to understand the nomothetic,
scientific anarchist content. This is also valid for Bakunin's most well
known work, God and the State - Dieu et l'Ètat. Bakunin originally titled
the book The Historical Sophisms of the Doctrinaire School of Communism.
Bakunin was not a Communist... God and the State was written between
February and March 1871. It was originally written as Part II of a greater
work that was going to be called The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social
Revolution. 

God and the State is indeed a fragment; the book has paragraphs that drop
out and pick up in mid-sentence, footnotes that are four or five paragraphs
long, and the book itself stops abruptly in mid-sentence. When Bakunin was
criticized on this he said, "My life is a fragment." The anarchists Carlo
Cafiero and …lisÈe Reclus edited and translated the work into French and
distributed it as a pamphlet in Geneva in 1882, the first printed edition.
They sometimes changed words around to give the French a more literary
quality, and often misread Bakunin's handwriting. Several other issues with
different editing have appeared later. As an unfinished work, it may not be
representative for Bakunin's ideas on collectivist anarchism. 

Especially a slogan on socialism (not anarchism) from God and the State,
often quoted by marxist provocateurs and out of context to 1. discredit the
anarchists and anarchism, 2. create chaos/ochlarchy and put the blame
falsely on anarchists, and 3. (later) call for authoritarian rule by a
marxist party; must be mentioned: "Destroy all the institutions of
Inequality; establish social and economic equality of all, and on this basis
will arise freedom, morality, human solidarity around the world... I shall
return to this, the most important question of Socialism." 

Thus, this slogan should be seen in the context of Bakunin's famous
anarchist word of wisdom: "Liberty without socialism is privilege,
injustice; socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality", which is
still valid. 

And thus it is clear that Bakunin by the phrase 'destroy all the
institutions of Inequality' means change of the societal organization, i.e.
combined with freedom and other anarchist principles: to do away with top
heavy social pyramids economically and/or political/adminstrative -- in rank
and/or income -- and move toward horizontal organization, and not attacking
and destroying persons and things, material resources. And in this context:
freedom and liberty will of course not arise automatically in a mysterious
marxist dialectical way from equality; freedom is another basic anarchist
principle that must be fought for and developed on its own. Marxists don't
understand that. 

Statism and Anarchy was the last major work by Bakunin. It was written in
1873, in the aftermath of the rise of the German Empire and the clash
between Bakunin and Karl Marx in the 1st International. Bakunin assesses the
strength of a European state system dominated by Bismarck. Then, in the most
remarkable part of the book, he assails the marxist alternative, predicting
that a 'dictatorship of the proletariat' will in fact be a dictatorship over
the proletariat, and will produce a new class of socialist rulers. Instead,
he outlines his vision of an anarchist society and identifies the social
forces he believes will achieve an anarchist revolution. 

Collectivist anarchism must not be mixed up with marxian collectivism,
council communism and similar included, sometimes wrongly called
"anarcho-marxism", and often just called collectivism, without adjective.
Collectivism is located to the left of collectivist anarchism on the
economical-political map, in the marxist quadrant. Some of Bakunin's ideas
may have a more social-individualist than collectivist approach, and the
earlier non-anarchist, typically dialectical, writings of Bakunin are of
little to zero interest in anarchist perspective.

Support the Cuban 5 Visa Campaign:



United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navenethem Pillay has met with Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva, two of the wives of the Cuban 5, and has stated that she will intercede on 
their behalf. 

Now that Rene Gonzalez has renounced his 
citizenship and is free in Cuba with 
his wife Olga Salanueva, this means Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo is the 
only member of the Cuban 5 who has not seen his wife. 


For the 
past 15 years Gerardo Hernandez‚Äôs wife, Adriana Perez, hasn‚Äôt been 
allowed to visit him.¬† The U.S. asserts that she is a risk to national security, despite the fact that the U.S. government has no proof or rationale to 
justify this belief.¬† This separation is a violation of Gerardo‚Äôs civil 
and international rights as a prisoner.

Mail or Fax Ms. Pillay the Project's Letter and hold her accountable to her public statement of support.¬† Remind her that the U.S. community supports the Cuban 5 and their wives' visitation rights.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for the case of the Cuban Five
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, 
yesterday, Olga Salanueva, spouse of Ren√© Gonz√°lez, and Adriana P√©rez, 
spouse of Gerardo Hern√°ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and 
Olga explained to the High Commissioner the necessity that this 
organization intercedes in a direct manner on behalf of the case of the 
Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while they requested their support
 in order to be granted visas to entry the United States to visit their 
husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime 
endured by Rene constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with 
any purpose and unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and 
reunite his relatives. Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that 
requires the political willingness and ethics of the United States Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a violation to the human rights and expressed this cannot constitute an additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to this fight and her intention 
to do whatever is possible to find a solution to the case.

FREE THE CUBAN 5 MONTH (Sept. 12th-Oct. 12th)


 

The Cuban 5:Fernando Gonzalez (free), Antonio Guerrero, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Labanino and Rene Gonzalez (free).

¬†"Ours may be one of the most ridiculous accusations of espionage in the history of this country"
-Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo of The Cuban 5


September 12th, 2014 will mark the 16th year anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5; one who is currently on 
parole in Cuba and four U.S. held Cuban political prisoners and 
incarcerated for protecting Cuba from U.S. sponsored terrorist actions.

In 2006, President Ricardo Alarcon, of the Cuban Parliament, declared 
Sept. 12th through October 6th to be a period of time to raise awareness on the case of the Cuban 5. The Popular Education Project to Free the 
Cuban 5 is committed to building an international movement for the Cuban 5‚Äôs freedom by extending this period of time to be a full month (Sept. 
12th-October 12th) and calling it "Free the Cuban 5 Month!"

During this month we organize a calendar of events to raise awareness about 
the Cuban 5 and how people can work for their freedom! With the recent release 
of Rene Gonzalez and Fernando Gonzalez, we feel it is time to double our efforts to free Antonio Guerrero, Gerardo Hernandez, and Ramon Laba√±ino!¬† 


We ask that you support all these events and actions!¬† Our COLLECTIVE action can free these innocent men!¬† Together we will:
FREE THE CUBAN 5!

Rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos, and far from anarchy and
anarchic, in Libya. Brown Card to CNN

CNN writes on its website 01.09.2014: ìANARCHY IN LIBYAî, ìU.S. diplomats
evacuated the anarchic Libyan capital last monthî and ìthe anarchy that
currently reigns in Libya's capitalî.  This is an Orwellian ì1984î newspeak
lie. De facto there is rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos, and
far from anarchy and anarchic, in Libya - included Tripoli. CNN gets a Brown
Card for this serious break of the Oslo-Convention. Libya is at the moment a
failed state, i.e. a State ñ not anarchy and anarchic. Libya will probably
be a failed state ñ a rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos, for
many years. 

  _____  

ANARCHY VS ECONOMIC-POLITICAL CHAOS
FAILED STATES ARE STATES - ARCHIES - NOT ANARCHY

The modern, updated definitions of state and anarchy 

1. Authoritarians notoriously mix up anarchy, anarchist and anarchism with
authoritarian tendencies: Chaos, disorder, mob rule (narrowly defined),
lawlessness, the law of the jungle, criminality, riots, theft, corruption,
drugs, mafia, terrorism, autocratic rule, the right to the strongest,
antisocial tyrannic behavior, etc. i.e. different types of superiors and
subordinates. The Greek rooted word for mob rule is ochlarchy. Ochlarchy
broadly defined may also be used as a common word for all the authoritarian
evils mentioned above, i.e. in general lack of security and law and order in
a society as a public sector service. This is ochlarchy, the opposite of
anarchy, i.e. based on libertarian law and order and security as public
sector services, according to the anarchist (IFA) principle of social
justice. The ochlarchists/ochlarchs are rulers of chaos, with equal to or
more than 666 per thousand (67%) authoritarian degree, i.e. very evil. This
also includes very chaotic, authoritarian social systems, i.e., say,
rivaling polyarchy/oligarchy with ochlarchy. State in a broad societal
meaning is systems with significantly large rank and/or income differences
and/or inefficient, i.e. significantly vertically organized, also chaotic.
Chaotic states, with rivaling polyarchy or oligarchy and ochlarchy, are
failed states, archies, not anarchies. 

2. The word anarchy origins from greek. The prefix "an" means "negation of"
as in anaerobe versus aerobe and "arch" means "superior, i.e. in contrast to
subordinates", as in archbishop, archangel, archduke, arch villain, etc.
Thus anarchy, anarchism, anarchist, a.s.o., mean coordination on equal
footing, without superiors and subordinates, i.e. horizontal organization
and co-operation without coercion, ideally or practically. Anarchy,
[an-arch]-y means [an = without, arch = ruler(s)]-y = system, management as
in monarch-y. Thus anarchy and anarchism mean "system and management without
ruler(s), i.e. co-operation without repression, tyranny and slavery". That
is economic and political/administrative, societal, management from the
people, grassroots, and upwards - significantly, without a top heavy pyramid
in rank and/or income, i.e. without a top - down approach. And thus
anarchies are systems with significantly small rank and income differences,
plus efficiency, i.e. significantly horizontally organized. This is the
opposite of the above mentioned authoritarian tendencies, i.e. different
types of superiors and subordinates, a top - down approach, chaos - and
rulers of chaos... state, also failed states. 

3. These modern, updated definitions of state vs anarchy are a.o.t. opposed
to Max Weber's outdated definitions. We think everybody should stick to
these modern, updated definitions, and not use arbitrary or Max Weber's
outdated definitions. It is important to see the real difference between
anarchies and states, including failed states, and not mix up states with
anarchy, that is quite something else. In general, necessary for anarchy and
anarchism is a functioning central administration, with law and order,
significantly horizontally organized. A breakdown of the central
administration, be it government/state/authority or significantly
horizontally organized, creates a failed state, see above, and not anarchy.
Wrongly calling states, including failed states, anarchies is authoritarian
Orwellian "1984" newspeak, and should be avoided. Authoritarian marxist,
liberalist and populist/fascist propaganda stations often present failed
states wrongly as anarchies. The IAT issues Brown Cards in this connection,
see below... 

Very chaotic states - failed states 

In the 1990s and later several examples of very chaotic, authoritarian
systems have been registered, say, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Liberia, Rwanda,
Albania, Sierra Leone, Congo, Solomon Islands, Burundi, Iraq, Haiti,
Somalia, Ivory Coast, Kyrgyztan, Zimbabwe, Libya, etc., and wrongly called
anarchy by some of the media. They are not anarchies according to the
definition 2. above, but clearly states, as defined in 1., mainly failed
states. 

These very authoritarian, chaotic economic-political systems may be marxist,
populist, fascist, nazi, or liberalism in a chaotic manner, but not anarchy,
anarchist or anarchism. When they were reported as "anarchies", i.e. in
reality rivaling polyarchies/oligarchies with ochlarchy, etc, these
countries had an authoritarian degree between ca 70 % - 80 % and thus a
libertarian degree as low as ca 20 % - 30 % , see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ranking.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/ranking.html .
Anarchies have libertarian degree equal to or more than 50%. Some of the
above mentioned states have improved a bit, i.e. they have now a higher
libertarian degree, but not very much. They are all still far from anarchy. 

Brown Card and APT-IAT 

The Anarchist Press Tribunal (the APT branch of the International Anarchist
Tribunal, IAT) issues a BROWN CARD WARNING to the media mixing up anarchy
and very chaotic authoritarian systems, i.e. ochlarchies etc., failed
states, according to the Oslo-convention. Notoriously authoritarian
reporters, spokesmen, etc, breaking the Oslo-convention of 1990 severely or
several times, will receive a BROWN CARD from the Anarchist Press Tribunal
as a symbol of free criticism, see  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html . 

Brown Cards and Brown Card warnings 

APT issues a special Brown Card warning to the editors at World News, CNN
28.06.97, who probably not yet have discovered that Albania has one of the
most authoritarian economic-political systems in Europe, and wrongly call it
"anarchy". The system in Albania is ochlarchy and chaos, i.e. authoritarian
- and thus not anarchy. The capitalistic pyramid mob rule of Berisha &amp; Co,
and the chaotic ochlarchy initiated by marxists, are by no means anarchy or
anarchist, i.e. horizontal organization and co-operation without coercion,
i.e. repression. 

A similar Brown Card warning is issued to Helge ÿgrim, NTB - Aftenposten
18.07.97, about Liberia. The very authoritarian and chaotic
economic-political system of this African country is either marxist,
populist, fascist, nazi, or liberalism, and thus not anarchist or anarchy as
suggested by Helge ÿgrim. Another Brown Card goes to Tove Gravdal for mixing
up the more than 666 per thousand authoritarian degree hell in Liberia with
"anarchy" in Aftenposten 12.07.2003. See also Nordic Branch of APT about the
Brown Card to Tove Gravdal. A Brown Card also goes to Barnaby Phillips at
BBC 07.08.2003 for calling the bloody chaos, rivaling polyarchy and
ochlarchy (mob rule) in Monrovia, Liberia, for "anarchy", i.e. quite
misleading. Another Brown Card goes to NRK-Utsyn 16.12.2003 for calling the
violent ochlarchy (mob rule) in Congo, with lack of law and order,
"anarchy". Anarchy and anarchism always have plenty of law and order, i.e.
libertarian law and order based on human rights. If not, the system is
significant authoritarian, and not anarchy and anarchism, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/lov1.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/lov1.html and
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html . Thus,
there is no anarchy in Congo.

06-7.03.2002: BBC News' Emily Buchanan reports about possible "anarchy" in
Sudan and Iraq, probably mixing it up with oligarchy, polyarchy, ochlarchy
and rivaling "states within the state", i.e. in short chaos, the quite
opposite of anarchy, i.e. real democracy and order. This authoritarian mix
of anarchy and chaos gives BBC's Emily B. a Brown Card warning. We'll like
to "see Emily play" with something she understands better in the future...

A similar Brown card warning goes to BBC and NRK Altid Nyheter 17.07.2003
reporting about "the Solomon Islands have been sliding towards anarchy"
lately, probably meaning rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy, chaos and mutual
repression included, and not really anarchy. 

A Brown Card goes to BBC's Ben Brown who reported about the "total chaos of
anarchy" related to the situation in Iraq at BBC TV 11.04.2003. BBC's Ben
Brown also reported 06 &amp; 07.04.2003 about "anarchy" related to the situation
in Basra on BBC TV. - Forget it! You mean chaos, ochlarchy (mob rule) &amp;
rivaling polyarchy, lawlessness and looting (theft) we think, quite the
opposite of anarchy, and thus breaking the Oslo convention, see (click on)
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html . For a
general update on law and anarchism search for "law" in
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html .
See also Nordic branch of APT-IAT about the situation in Iraq after the rule
of Saddam Hussein. The situation in Iraq at the moment is an extreme form of
liberalism, not anarchism.

A Brown Card goes to BBC and NRK-Alltid Nyheter 03.08.2003 reporting about
"lawless anarchy" in Basra, Iraq, for breaking the Oslo convention severely.
The situation in Basra with rivaling polyarchy and "states within the
state", ochlarchy (mob rule), lawlessness, chaos and mutual repression, is
very authoritarian, and thus quite the opposite of anarchy. 20.03.2009 the
authoritarian marxist propaganda station BBC continues to call the situation
i Iraq in 2003 "anarchy", in the false meaning of ochlarchy including chaos,
and gets a fresh Brown Card. 

Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe has 04.11.2003 accused President
Chandrika Kumaratunga of bringing Sri Lanka to the verge of anarchy and
chaos, according to BBC and several other newsmedia. If it is on the verge
of anarchy the country cannot be on the verge of chaos, because anarchy is
quite the opposite of chaos, according to the Oslo Convention, and Ranil
Wickramasinghe gets a Brown Card from IAT-APT together with the newsmedia.
BBC and NRK-Alltid nyheter get a Brown Card for a similar statement about
"anarchy" and chaos in Haiti 10.01.2004. NRK-Urix gets a Brown Card
26.02.2004 for stating "anarkiet hersker", "anarchy rules" in Haiti, wrongly
mixing up "anarchy" with ochlarchy. Anarchy rules ok in Norway since
1994/95, ochlarchy rules in Haiti 2004, and that is not ok. 

25.03.2005 NRK-Dagsrevyen reports about "anarchy" in Kyrgyztan, mixing up
anarchy with rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy, i.e. mob rule broadly
defined, included looting (theft) and chaos, and thus breaking the Oslo
Convention and gets a Brown Card. 26.03.2005 Sveriges Radio reports about
"anarchy" and chaos in Kyrgyztan, and shares the Brown Card with NRK.

29.09.2004 and 06.01.2005: NRK-Alltid Nyheter talks about chaos and
"anarchy" in Somalia, mixing up rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy and chaos with
anarchy, and thus gets a Brown Card. 06.03.2005 NRK- Dagsrevyen reports
about "anarchy" in Somalia, and shares the Brown Card of 06.01.2005.
06.12.2010. NRK-TV2 sends and anglophone program about Somalia falsely
calling it 'anarchy', and thus NRK gets a Brown Card. 

CNN 06.01.2007 reports "The ease with which Somalis can get weapons is a
major problem in this chaotic African nation. It has not had an effective
government since clan-based warlords toppled a military dictatorship in 1991
and plunged the country into anarchy, " - mixing up rivaling polyarchy,
ochlarchy and chaos with anarchy, and thus gets a Brown Card. 16.12.2008:
Brown Card to the authoritarian conservative liberalist propaganda station
CNN for wrongly calling the rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy in Somalia
anarchy! In a commercial for their own program the CNN is daily spreading
myths that they have "a front road seat to anarchy" in Somalia. You are
reporting wrong. Somalia is a failed STATE, i.e. a STATE, not anarchy. It is
a STATE, i.e. archy, with rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy. NOT ANARCHY!!!!
We give you a Brown Card because you are spreading lies that Somalia is an
anarchy. This is authoritarian, Orwellian "1984" newspeak... 04.10.2009.
Christiane Amanpour on CNN declares: "Anarchy has been a constant in
Somalia", and gets a Brown Card for spreading this disinformation. The
IAT-APT repeats: "Somalia is a failed STATE, i.e. a STATE, not anarchy. It
is a STATE, i.e. archy, with rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy. NOT ANARCHY!
Anarchy and State are opposites." CNN 02.07.2010 again mentions "anarchy" in
connection to Somalia and get another Brown Card. 

Tuesday, November 20, 2007 the New York Times, ID 40041893, reports:
"Somalia's ills have always come in waves, starting in 1991 when clan-based
militias overthrew the central government and the country plunged into
anarchy. That fighting, like the fighting today, disrupted markets, kept out
aid shipments and led to rapid inflation of food prices. As a result,
hundreds of thousands of people starved." This is authoritarian Orwellian
"1984" newspeak from NYTimes. It has never been anarchy in Somalia, just
rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy, etc, a failed state, and thus according to
the Oslo Convention NYTimes gets a Brown Card. 

03.12.2009. Brown Card to Wikipedia. The authoritarian mockery of a free
encyclopedia, Wikipedia, falsely reports about "Anarchy in Somalia"; see
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_in_Somalia&gt;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_in_Somalia . The International
Anarchist Tribunal - Anarchist Press Tribunal ( IAT-APT) declares: It has
never since 1991 been anarchy in Somalia, just rivaling polyarchy with
ochlarchy and chaos, a failed State. Somalia is a failed STATE, i.e. a
STATE, not anarchy. It is a STATE, i.e. archy, with rivaling polyarchy,
ochlarchy and chaos. NOT ANARCHY! Anarchy and State are opposites. Anarchy
and rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. archy, are opposites. Anarchy
and chaos are opposites, see the Oslo Convention
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html and search
for anarchy vs chaos at  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html . To mix up opposites as 1. Anarchy and
State, 2. Anarchy and rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. archy, and 3.
Anarchy and chaos, as Wikipedia does, is equally authoritarian as mixing up
opposites as peace and war, as Big Brother did in Orwell's "1984" newspeak.
It should be stopped, and the IAT-APT hands out a Brown Card to Wikipedia,
as free, libertarian criticism of this authoritarian tendency. The Anarchist
International and the IAT-APT of course condemn the terrorism and ochlarchy
in general in Somalia. 

06.01.2010. Brown Card to CIA. The CIA (non)fact book falsely reports "After
the regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil,
factional fighting, and anarchy."; see
&lt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/countrytem
plate_so.html&gt;
https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/countrytemp
late_so.html . The International Anarchist Tribunal - Anarchist Press
Tribunal ( IAT-APT) declares: It has never since 1991 been anarchy in
Somalia, just rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy and chaos, a failed State.
Somalia is a failed STATE, i.e. a STATE, not anarchy. It is a STATE, i.e.
archy, with rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy and chaos. NOT ANARCHY! Anarchy
and State are opposites. Anarchy and rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e.
archy/state, are opposites. Anarchy and chaos are opposites, see the Oslo
Convention  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html and search for anarchy vs chaos at
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html .
To mix up opposites as 1. Anarchy and State, 2. Anarchy and rivaling
polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. archy/state, as CIA does, is equally
authoritarian as mixing up opposites as peace and war, as Big Brother did in
Orwell's "1984" newspeak. It should be stopped, and the IAT-APT hands out a
Brown Card to CIA, as free, libertarian criticism of this authoritarian
tendency. The Anarchist International and the IAT-APT of course condemn the
terrorism and ochlarchy in general in Somalia. 

26.11.2009. Mohamed Olad Hassan, Tom Odula and Associated Press declare:
"Somalia has been mired in anarchy and chaos since 1991 when warlords
overthrew longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre." It is true that Somalia has
been mired in chaos, but it has never been anarchy there. Chaos and anarchy
are opposites, see the Oslo Convention  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html and search for anarchy vs chaos at
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html .
To mix up opposites as anarchy and chaos as Mohamed Olad Hassan, Tom Odula
and Associated Press do, is equally authoritarian as mixing up opposites as
peace and war, as Big Brother did in Orwell's "1984" newspeak. It should be
stopped, and the International Anarchist Tribunal - Anarchist Press Tribunal
hands out Brown Cards to Mohamed Olad Hassan, Tom Odula and Associated
Press, as free, libertarian criticism of this authoritarian tendency. 

A similar Brown Card goes to the authoritarian marxist propaganda station
BBC for falsely reporting about "anarchy" in Somalia in their Country
profile: Somalia, updated Friday, 2 May 2008 at
&lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1072592.stm&gt;
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1072592.stm ,
quoting:"Somalia has been without an effective central government since
President Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991. Years of fighting between rival
warlords and an inability to deal with famine and disease have led to the
deaths of up to one million people. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former leader
of the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland, was chosen by Somalia's
interim parliament as president of the Transitional Federal Government in
October 2004. The election took place in Kenya because the Somali capital
was regarded as being too dangerous. The president pledged to promote
reconciliation and to set about rebuilding the country. But his government,
plagued by internal disagreements, has failed to end Somalia's anarchy. BBC
also mentions "SURVIVING ANARCHY" at the same web-page. It must be clear to
all that Somalia is a failed state, i.e. a state - and not anarchy. 

10.05.2009 BBC-TV correctly states that "Somalia, a nation of about eight
million people, has experienced almost constant civil conflict since the
collapse of its central government in January 1991." But it is totally wrong
to call this anarchy, as BBC-TV does. Anarchy means a functioning central
administration, but not government, i.e. top heavy pyramid in rank and/or
income, significantly vertically organized. The system with rivaling
polyarchy and ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined) in Somalia is clearly
government, archy, and not anarchy. Thus the authoritarian marxist
propaganda station BBC-TV gets a Brown Card, for spreading this
disinformation, according to the Oslo Convention. 15.08.2012 IAT hands out a
Brown Card to BBC for continuing to lie "Somalia's decades of anarchy" 01.06
and 15.08.2012. The situation in Somalia is and has been rivaling polyarchy
with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - NOT ANARCHY. Somalia is the country most far
from anarchy in the world. 04.06.2013 Robert Fowler on BBC's Hardtalk,
mentions "chaos and anarchy" in Somalia, and the IAT hands out Brown Cards
to Fowler and BBC, according to the Oslo Convention. 

15.09.2009 BBC reports about "anarchy and lawlessness" in Zimbabwe. Anarchy
is optimal order and not lawlessness. It is a very authoritarian ochlarchy
in Zimbabwe, far from anarchy, and the authoritarian marxist propaganda
station BBC-TV gets a Brown Card, for spreading this disinformation,
according to the Oslo Convention. 29.11.2010 BBC-TV continues wrongly to
call Somalia 'anarchy' and the BBC's Website is full of this lie, thus
IAT-APT hands out another Brown Card to BBC, this ultra-authoritarian
marxist propaganda 'news'-station. 

Brown card to CNN and Arwa Damon for falsely calling the rivaling polyarchy
and ochlarchy in Iraq - anarchy. 28.05.2009 and repeated several times CNN
in "World's untold stories - Inside Iraq: Living with the enemy" (by Arwa
Damon) expresses: "Not long ago it seemed that Iraq was on the edge of
complete anarchy. Bodies were been dumped in the streets every day as Sunni
and Shia groups settled scores... Iraqis turned on each other, neighbors
slaughtered neighbors, friends betrayed one another. It was the sheer
degradation of society on a shocking and utterly petrifying scale." It must
be clear for all educated people that this situation in Iraq was not near
complete, 100%, anarchy, or any form of anarchy of lower degree, i.e.
systems with an anarchy degree above 50% and thus an authoritarian degree
less than 50 %. The situation in Iraq was a very authoritarian hell society
with rivaling polyarchy/oligarchy mixed with ochlarchy (mob rule), i.e. with
more than 666 per thousand (67%) authoritarian degree, and thus very far
from anarchy. Polyarchy with ochlarchy is not anarchy. CNN and Arwa Damon
get a Brown Card, for spreading this disinformation, according to the Oslo
Convention. The system by now is a bit less authoritarian, but still far
from anarchy. 

11.04.2009: Robert D. Kaplan, Center for a New American Security, and the
IHT-NY-Times get a Brown Card for breaking the Oslo Convention and falsely
postulating "anarchy on land means piracy at sea", "piracy is the maritime
ripple effect of anarchy on land. Somalia is a failed state and has the
longest coastline in mainland Africa, so piracy flourishes nearby." "Somali
pirates are usually unemployed young men who have grown up in an atmosphere
of anarchic violence, and have been dispatched by a local warlord to bring
back loot for his coffers. It is organized crime carried out by roving
gangs." As Kaplan correctly states Somalia is failed state, i.e. a STATE
with rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined) and chaos,
rivaling states within the state, i.e. a form of archy, but not as he
suggests anarchy, the quite opposite. We repeat: SOMALIA is a STATE, ARCHY -
NOT ANARCHY. Anarchy and State are opposites. There are no pirates at sea
outside Norway and Iceland, i.e. anarchies.  

16-17.01.2010. Brown Card to Luis Carballo and Euronews, that speak about
"total anarchy" in Haiti. Haiti is after the massive earthquake to be
considered as a FAILED STATE. The central administration is no longer
functioning. Haiti is now a failed STATE, i.e. a STATE, not anarchy. It is a
STATE, i.e. archy, with rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy and chaos. NOT
ANARCHY! Anarchy and State are opposites. Anarchy and rivaling polyarchy
with ochlarchy, i.e. archy, are opposites. Anarchy and chaos are opposites,
see the Oslo Convention  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html and search for anarchy vs chaos at
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html .
To mix up opposites as 1. Anarchy and State, 2. Anarchy and rivaling
polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. archy, and 3. Anarchy and chaos, as Luis
Carballo and Euronews do, is equally authoritarian as mixing up opposites as
peace and war, as Big Brother did in Orwell's "1984" newspeak. It should be
stopped, and the IAT-APT hands out Brown Cards to Luis Carballo and
Euronews, as free, libertarian criticism of this authoritarian tendency. The
Anarchist International and the IAT-APT of course condemn the chaos and
ochlarchy in Haiti, and call for law and order. It is not anarchy in Haiti,
not total anarchy and not anarchy of lower degree! Jan Espen Kruse and NRK
report "kaotisk ... totalt lovl¯se tilstander ... anarki," in Haiti, setting
chaos and lawlessness, i.e. ochlarchy, falsely equal to anarchy, and thus
get Brown Cards. 

CNN and Lucia Newman describe the situation in Port-au-Prince, as "anarchy
... anarchy grips Haitian capital", they falsey postulate, mentioning "armed
gangs, thugs, are ransacking, patrolling the streets at will, and there are
no police to be seen." This is however rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy,
and not anarchy, and thus CNN and Lucia Newman get Brown Cards. Later Ivan
Watson on CNN falsely calls the situation in Haiti "anarchic", and he gets a
Brown Card. NY-Times and Mark Lacey report "patience was wearing thin, and
reports of looting increased, ... for the moment, this is anarchy," said
Adolphe Reynald, a top aide to the mayor of Port-au-Prince. "For the
moment", it is not anarchy, but as mentioned rivaling polyarchy with
ochlarchy and chaos, and NY-Times, Mark Lacey and Adolphe Reynald get Brown
Cards. 

In another article in NY-Times the "Big Brothers" Mark Lacey and Simon
Romero report "there were pockets of violence and anarchy, reports of
looting and ransacking, and at least one lynching of an accused looter as
police officers stood aside." As mentioned it is rivaling polyarchy with
ochlarchy and chaos, and a failed state, in Haiti - the quite opposite of
anarchy. The central administration is not functioning in Haiti, and a
functioning central administration - with law and order - is necessary for
anarchy. Thus NY-Times, Mark Lacey and Simon Romero get a fresh Brown Card.
Reuters and Carlos Barria report "It's anarchy there now, total chaos, the
police have gone away," about Haiti, and also they get a Brown Card. The
Anarchist International calls on all anarchists to send money-aid to Haiti,
through safe channels, say Red Cross. 11.09.2010 BBC (TV) in a retrospective
report falsely postulates that Haiti was "on the brink of anarchy", and gets
a Brown Card from IAT-APT according to the Oslo Convention. 

14.11.2004: Euronews is reporting: During a public debate in the city of
Marseille, the French president said Paris would carry on with its UN
peacekeeping mandate, which he says was also backed by other African
nations. In criticism of the regime of Ivorian President Laurant Gbagbo, he
said he would not leave the former colony, which was once a model to others,
to head down a road towards "anarchy and fascism". The French president is
probably mixing up rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy and chaos with anarchy, and
thus gets a Brown Card. Anarchy and fascism are opposite systems on the
Economical-Political map, and thus anarchy cannot exist together with
fascism at the same time and place. 

CNN writes on its website 01.09.2014: ìANARCHY IN LIBYAî, ìU.S. diplomats
evacuated the anarchic Libyan capital last monthî and ìthe anarchy that
currently reigns in Libya's capitalî.  This is an Orwellian ì1984î newspeak
lie. De facto there is rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos, and
far from anarchy and anarchic, in Libya - included Tripoli. CNN gets a Brown
Card for this serious break of the Oslo-Convention. Libya is at the moment a
failed state, i.e. a State ñ not anarchy and anarchic. Libya will probably
be a failed state ñ a rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos, for
many years.

 "Ours may be one of the most ridiculous accusations of espionage in the history of this country" -Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo of The Cuban 5


September 12th, 2014 will mark the 16th year anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5; three current U.S. held 
Cuban political prisoners (two were released and live in Cuba)  and 
incarcerated for protecting Cuba from U.S. sponsored terrorist actions.

In 2006, President Ricardo Alarcon, of the Cuban Parliament, declared 
Sept. 12th through October 6th to be a period of time to raise awareness on the case of the Cuban 5. The Popular Education Project to Free the 
Cuban 5 is committed to building an international movement for the Cuban 5‚Äôs freedom by extending this period of time to be a full month (Sept. 
12th-October 12th) and calling it "Free the Cuban 5 Month!"

During this month we organize a calendar of events to raise awareness about 
the Cuban 5 and how people can work for their freedom! With the recent release 
of Rene Gonzalez and Fernando Gonzalez, we feel it is time to double our efforts to free Antonio Guerrero, Gerardo Hernandez, and Ramon Laba√±ino!

29.06.2014. Iraq and Syria. An offshoot of al Qaeda which has seized
territory in Iraq and Syria has declared itself an Islamic "caliphate" and
called on factions worldwide to pledge their allegiance, a statement posted
on Islamist websites and Twitter said on Sunday. The group, previously known
as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and also known as ISIS,
has renamed itself "Islamic State" and proclaimed its leader Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi as "Caliph" - the head of the state, the statement said. The

Obama said. "We support our allies when they're in danger." A key concern
for U.S. officials: dozens of American consular staff and military advisers
working with the Iraqi military in Irbil, the largest city in Iraq's Kurdish
region. Two U.S. F/A-18 jet fighters bombed artillery of Sunni Islamic
extremists (ISIS) in Iraq on Friday, escalating America's military
involvement more than two years after President Barack Obama brought home
forces from the country. Later the U.S. military has begun a second round of
airstrikes against ISIS in area of Irbil. Source: CNN.

09.08.2014. Iraq. President Obama said on Saturday 09.08.2014 that the
airstrikes and humanitarian assistance drops he ordered last week in Iraq
could go on for months, preparing Americans for an extended military
presence in the skies there as Iraq's leaders try to build a new government.

Nobel Peace Prize 2014 - Comment from the anarchists

10.10.2014. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace
Prize for 2014 is to be awarded to Pakistani child education activist Malala
Yousafzai and Indian child rights activist Kailash Satyrathi. The Anarchist
International congratulates the winners. The prize itself will be awarded in
Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of industrialist Alfred Nobel's death. 

Some time has passed on since the Norwegian People turned their back against
the main economic political course of the social democrat government, at the
1994 EU referendum. The megatrend of the late eighties and early nineties
was a movement to the right and upwards on the Economical Political Map. The
EU referendum indicated a further jump in this direction, and thus the
economic political system in Norway made a revolutionary change, and passed
the border between the marxist social democrat sector and the anarchist
sector of social individualism. This of course is a major social event in
the economic political world history. A long jump further rightwards may
result in a social liberal system, and a reverse tendency may give a
retardation to marxist social democracy, but this is not the case at the
moment. Thus, Norway became an anarchy in 1994/95, and it still is an
anarchist economic-political system. 

And thus, the Anarchy of Norway is still going strong. Although the system
is significantly anarchist, i.e. within the Quadrant of Anarchism on the
economic political map, it is somewhat far from the anarchist ideal on the
top of the map. "So this is heaven: Norway", the LA-TIMES in USA reports
about Norway, November 2001, but this is however a bit exaggerated; see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/report1.html&gt; American look at Norway - Report no 1,
where the article is quoted, with comments from IIFOR added. Another
American article on the situation in Norway, quoted from NY-TIMES January
2002, also with comments from IIFOR, is also included. 

The main policy of the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; Anarchist
International (AI/IFA) and The Anarchist Federation of Norway (
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/afin.html&gt; AFIN) was presented in the largest
Newspaper in Norway, Verdens Gang 06.11.2001, p 39, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/vg1html.html&gt; Anarchy is [real] democracy - article
in VG. This article also states "Norway [as] a relatively anarchist country,
however a bit far from the anarchist ideal (Norge som et relativt
anarkistisk land, men noksÂ langt fra det anarkistiske ideal)." 

In June 2002 a libertarian direct action against the World Bank's
reactionary policy and the ABCDE-meeting, in Oslo, once more confirmed that
anarchy is significantly on in Norway, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/abcde.html&gt; Direct action against the ABCDE-meeting
and policy. Norwegian firms are more and more horizontally organized,
according to Nordhaug and Gooderham at NHH (Dagsavisen 15 &amp; 16.10.2004). 

A degree of anarchism of ca 54%, as in Norway 2013 is as mentioned not a
high degree of anarchism. This means the authoritarian degree is still ca
46%. If the libertarian degree is less than 50% there is no anarchy at all.
About 54% anarchy degree is quite an accepted estimate. It is a.o.t. quoted
in Dagens NÊringsliv (the Industrial life of today, the main economical
newspaper of Norway) no 2/3 June 2007 and Finansavisen (the Financial
newspaper) Wednesday 17. October 2007, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/dnfa.html&gt; anarchist articles in DN and Finansavisen.


30.05.2007. The Anarchy of Norway was rated as the most peaceful nation in
the world, and since the middle of 1995 the country has also been ranked as
the most libertarian and anarchist on planet Gaia, a.k.a. Tellus and Earth.

15.01.2010. Positive citizen survey: A nationwide citizen survey shows that
86 per cent of Norwegians think that their country is close to being a
perfect country to live in.

02.11.2011. Flat hierarchy challenges new leaders. Norway's "flat, flat,
flat" management hierarchy [i.e. not topheavy pyramid economically and/or
political/adminstrative] poses a huge challenge for new leaders recruited
from overseas. It can also explain why there's so few of them within the
Norwegian business world. "Many leaders can feel so disrespected when they
come to Norway," said Kimberly Lein-Mathisen, global alliance leader for the
large US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Everyone is equal, and employees
are accustomed to being consulted on most matters, and having their say.
Source: www.newsinenglish.no.

So called heaven or not, 54% anarchism is far from the 100% anarchist ideal.
Thus, it is plenty of room for improvement from anarchist perspective, and
by no means time for a break in the fight against authoritarian tendencies.
The revolution must be fought permanent, in the daily life, to sustain and
develop further. However, as long as a) Norway stays out of EU, b) populist
and nationalist tendencies are put at place, and c) the left and right
tendencies outbalance each other reasonable as by now, Norway will probably
stay anarchist, and be a lighthouse for EU and the rest of the world.

Support the Cuban 5 Visa Campaign:


United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navenethem Pillay has met 
with Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva, two of the wives of the Cuban 5, 
and has stated that she will intercede on their behalf. 

Now that Rene Gonzalez is now free in Cuba with his wife Olga Salanueva, this 
means Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo is the only member of the Cuban 5 who 
has not seen his wife. 

For the past 16 years Gerardo Hernandez‚Äôs wife, Adriana Perez, hasn‚Äôt been allowed to visit him.  The U.S. 
asserts that she is a risk to national security, despite the fact that 
the U.S. government has no proof or rationale to justify this belief.  
This separation is a violation of Gerardo‚Äôs civil and international rights as a prisoner.

Mail or Fax Ms. Pillay the Project's Letter and hold her accountable to her public statement of support.  
Remind her that the U.S. community supports the Cuban 5 and their wives' visitation rights.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for the case of the Cuban Five
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, 
yesterday, Olga Salanueva, spouse of Ren√© Gonz√°lez, and Adriana P√©rez, 
spouse of Gerardo Hern√°ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and 
Olga explained to the High Commissioner the necessity that this 
organization intercedes in a direct manner on behalf of the case of the 
Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while they requested their support
 in order to be granted visas to entry the United States to visit their 
husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime 
endured by Rene constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with 
any purpose and unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and 
reunite his relatives. Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that 
requires the political willingness and ethics of the United States 
Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a 
violation to the human rights and expressed this cannot constitute an 
additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to 
this fight and her intention to do whatever is possible to find a 
solution to the case.

Anarchism and anarchy defined

1. Anarchy and anarchism mean "system and management without ruler(s), i.e.
co-operation without repression, tyranny and slavery". In short an-arch-y =
[(an = without - arch = ruler(s)) - y = system (included optimal order and
law) and management, as, say, in monarch-y]. Anarchy and anarchism are
efficient and fair system and management without top heavy societal pyramid
economical and/or political/administrative - in income and/or rank, i.e.
significant horizontal organization - real democracy.

2. The Economic-Political Map 

http://www.anarchy.no/epwm2.gif

The anarchy degree is 100% - the authoritarian degree within the anarchist
quadrant. (Esquerda means left, and direita means right. The star indicates
the Norwegian economic-political system after the velvet anarchist
revolution in 1994/95.)

3. Authoritarians notoriously mix up anarchy, anarchist and anarchism with
authoritarian tendencies: Chaos, disorder, mob rule (narrowly defined),
lawlessness, the law of the jungle, criminality, riots, theft, corruption,
drugs, mafia, terrorism, autocratic rule, the right to the strongest,
antisocial tyrannic behavior, etc. i.e. different types of superiors and
subordinates, all in all ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined). 

4. The word anarchy origins from greek. The prefix "an" means "negation of"
as in anaerobe versus aerobe and "arch" means "superior, i.e. in contrast to
subordinates", as in archbishop, archangel, archduke, arch villain, etc. NB!
Any villain, ochlarch/ist, is an arch vis-a-vis the victims. Thus anarchy,
anarchism, anarchist, a.s.o., mean coordination on equal footing, without
superiors and subordinates, i.e. horizontal organization and co-operation
without coercion - practically (significant,  &gt; 50% anarchy degree) or
ideally (towards 100% anarchy degree). This is the opposite of the above
mentioned authoritarian tendencies, i.e. different types of superiors and
subordinates - in general ochlarchy. 

5. Ochlarchy is typical with more than 67% authoritarian degree. Anarchy has
equal to or more than 50% anarchy degree. Anarchy is organization in general
without (significant) arch(s), but not without management. The influence on
the management, economic and political/administrative, in private and public
sector, goes in general more from the bottom - the grassroots - upwards than
from the top downwards. At the middle-point of the map the influence from
the bottom is 50%. At the top of the map, the anarchist ideal, the influence
from the bottom is 100%, or the organization is without top, 100% flat.
Norway, The Swiss Confederation and Iceland are anarchies of low degree
(anarchy degree &gt; 50% but less than 60%). Other countries are more or less
authoritarian (significant, &gt; 50% authoritarian degree).

Anarchy in international perspective

Introduction

In 1972 it was a referendum about Norwegian membership to the EEC - EF . 2
645 349 had the right to vote, 79,2 % participated and 53,3 % voted no. A
vast majority among the anarchists voted no. The anarchist movement - the
trendsetter in the fight for more socialism and autonomy, joined forces and
founded the Anarchist Federation of Norway, - Anarkistf¯derasjonen i Norge -
Anarkistenes Organisasjon, in September 1977. Among the early affiliates
were Arnold Hazeland Jr., at that time a leader at the "Fri Rettshjelp"
(free legal action support), also a lawyer as his grandfather, the prominent
high court judge and probably the most famous anarchist in Norway until 1945
Arnold Hazeland; a young relative of Christopher Hansteen, relatives of
people related to Rasmus Steinsvik, old anarchosyndicalists, and others,
i.e. industrial workers, farmers, teachers, cultural workers, lawyers,
artists, journalists, students, all kinds of people. The Anarchist
Federation formed a junction vis-‡-vis the domestic megatrend to the right
and upwards on the economical political map in the late nineteen eighties
and early nineties, i.e. in the fight for more autonomy and freedom, but
against economical plutarchist (capitalist) tendencies. A fight for less
rank and income differences, more efficiency and fairness, and against
political/administrative and economical bureaucracy broadly defined, in
private and public sector, within the country and internationally. 

In 1979 The Anarchist Federation affiliated to the Anarchist International,
IFA, The Anarchist Black Cross, ABC; and the Community Action Network, CAN.
In 1982 the first IFA Congress in the North was arranged in Oslo by
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/afin.html&gt; AFIN, constituting the different other
Northern IFA-sections, i.e. Swedish, Danish, Finnish, etc. and confirming
the Internationals of the different anarchist currents within the framework
of the general Anarchist International, i.e. eco-anarchist,
anarcho-feminist, -syndicalist, individualist, collectivist, as well as the
Internationals of commune/communist Anarchism and social individualist
Anarchism, including socialist, federalist and mutualist anarchism; and the
libertarian international of teetotallers. Also the International Anarchist
Tribunal, IAT, with the Anarchist Arbitration Court, say, suggested by Pjotr
Kropotkin already in 1910, the Anarchist Press Tribunal, and other branches
was founded at this congress. Several congresses and actions were arranged
during the years passing by. 

Early in the 1980s the Anarchist International University Federation -
Anarkistisk Universitetslag, was officially established, and in 1985 the
International Institute for Organization Research, IIFOR, the main research
institute of the anarchist movement was founded. The IIFOR, and the
research-groups of the Northern IFA-sections in general, joined the FICEDL,
the libertarian research network, officially in 1987, however anarchist
researchers related to NAC-IFA had also participated on earlier arrangements
of the FICEDL network. A. Hompland together with other anarchists started
Folkebladet/IJ@ in 1971, and this journal became later the organ of the
Anarchist Federation. Since 1984 H. Fagerhus has been the editor of
IJ@/Folkebladet. In 1982/83 Folkebladet became the common and main organ of
the NAC, the Northern Anarchist Confederation, and in 1984, including
IFA-Solidaritet etc, was established as the International Journal of
Anarchism. The currents of anarchism mentioned above were also confirmed as
sections of the Anarchist International in the Anarchist Manifesto, the
program of the Northern sections of IFA, ISBN 82-90468-09-1, see Folkebladet
No 4 (1983) and IFA-Solidaritet No 8 (1983). When the Anarchist
International world wide was confirmed at the International Anarchist
Congresses in 1998 and 2000, these main sections of anarchism were expanded
universally. 

The researcher P. Johansen said in Dagens NÊringsliv (Today's Industrial
Life) 08.02.2002 in a retrospective interview that "den gangen hadde Norge
en regulert ¯konomi og nÊrmest en ettpartistat", i.e. "at that time Norway
had a regulated economy and close to a one-party state". The country had a
marxian socialdemocratic type a bit socialistical system related to the
economical political map; most of the time ruled and dominated strongly by
the powerful Labor Party, Arbeiderpartiet (AP), from 1945/6 first clearly
authoritarian, later slowly less authoritarian until 1993/4.

The anarchist velvet revolutionary change in Norway in 1994/95

THE DOMESTIC MEGATREND - THE EU REFERENDUM - AND MORE... 

Introduction and summary. Anarchy in Norway, of low degree, but &gt; 50%, is
registered since 1994/95. The revolutionary change, i.e. when Norway entered
the social-individualist sector of the anarchist quadrant of the
economic-political map, is i) rooted back to a domestic megatrend to the
right and upwards on the economical-political map, ii) the No to EU
referendum 28.11.1994, and iii) more actions, that iv) gave the marxist
matriarch Gro Harlem Brundtland and her authoritarian government an
economic-political uppercut, which v) stopped the ruling and turned the
system into relatively anarchist administration/management. The development
of the libertarian/anarchist degree in Norway related to the velvet
revolution and revolutionary change in 1994/95 is estimated to the
following: 11-27.11.1994 = ca 49,4% (state); 28-29.11.1994 = ca 51%
(anarchy); 01.03.1995 = ca 52%; 01.06.1995 = ca 53%; 01.10.1995 = ca 53%, a
stabilized anarchy of low degree. The term "ca" means about. 28.11.1994 is
celebrated as the Day of the Anarchist Revolution in Norway, by
libertarians. 28.11.2014 the anarchist are celebrating the 20th anniversary
of the anarchist velvet revolution in Norway.

The history of the Anarchist Revolution. 28.11.1994 the marxist PM &amp; Co's
effort to break the domestic megatrend towards anarchy, by establishing
supra-national bureaucracy, was crushed by the EU-referendum. 3 266 064 had
the right to vote, 89,0 % participated and 52,2 % voted no. The
supra-national Brussels-bureaucracy had to return, the Norwegian system made
a revolutionary change, and passed the border to the anarchist quadrant on
the EP map. Before the referendum the ruling system virtually and in many
ways practically and mentally was "in" the European Union. The only that
lacked was de facto the "keys" to the offices... The "NO!" turned the whole
thing upside down... The marxist matriarch, called the "Yes to EU Queen" in
the newsmedia, and ruling powerful according to this title, de facto
abdicated as an arch, kept a low profile in the newsmedia, retired to a more
soft central administration only, and left the system significant to anarchy
rules - OK - in the following time. (There has not been a significant
ruler/arch of Norway since then.)

Soon after the No-vote was known, the CNN and othe main international
newsmedia reported that this was due to "Nationalistic" and
"Non-internationalistic" [authoritarian, backwards] tendencies, based on
disinformation from the Yes to EU government in Norway. However the
Anarchist International Information Service AIIS - Anarkistenes
Informasjonstjenest AIT - minutes after these newsreports faxed a message to
main international newsmedia, including CNN, stating that Norway was
libertarian, and [soon] anarchist. Soon after the CNN responded to the
AIIS-faxes and changed the news, reporting about: "an almost perfect
society", regarding the Norwegian economic-political system. Also other main
international newsmedia changed their reports in a similar way. They however
did not mention AIIS as a source, but they clearly responded by changing the
news according to the facts from AIIS. More information about the
international newsmedia's responses to AIIS-faxes, se below. 

The Northern Anarchist Confederation - Anarkistenes organisasjon i Norden,
expressed the following view:

At the EU referendum 28.11.1994, the Norwegian People turned their back
against the main economic political course of the social democrat
government. While the Norwegian EEC referendum in the early seventies gave a
movement to the left on the economic political map, the megatrend of the
late eighties and early nineties was a movement to the right and upwards.
The EU referendum indicated a further jump in this direction, and thus the
economic political system in Norway made a revolutionary change, and passed
the border between the marxist social democrat sector and the anarchist
sector of social individualism. This of course is a major social event in
the economic political world history. 

A long jump further rightwards may result in a social liberal system, and a
reverse tendency may give a retardation to marxist social democracy, but
this is not the case at the moment. Although the system by now is
significantly anarchist, i.e. within the Quadrant of Anarchism on the
economic political map, it is somewhat far from the anarchist ideal on the
top of the map. Thus, it is plenty of room for improvement from anarchist
perspective, and by no means time for a break in the fight against
authoritarian tendencies. The revolution must be fought permanent, in the
daily life, to sustain and develop further. However, as long as a) Norway
stays out of EU, b) populist and nationalist tendencies are put at place,
and c) the left and right tendencies outbalance each other reasonable as by
now, Norway will probably stay anarchist, and be a lighthouse for EU and the
rest of the world. Let's work together, on co-operative or individual basis,
in media, political and economic organizations, to support the Anarchy of
Norway and anarchist tendencies all over the world. 

After the revolutionary change, the coordinates of the Norwegian social
system are ca 55% socialism and ca 52% autonomy on the Economic-political
map. Thus, the degree of anarchy is about 53%, and the system is significant
anarchist. And thus, the bureaucratic tendency broadly defined, i.e. the
tendencies towards economical and political/administrative hierarchy, -
plutarchy (capitalism) and statism in different forms, oligarchy, polyarchy
and ochlarchy included, - measured by the authoritarian degree, is about
47%. Although not the significant, i.e. the system is clearly more anarchist
than authoritarian, it has a considerable bureaucratic tendency, an obstacle
against maximal efficiency and fairness, as well as anarchist human rights &amp;
ethics and a further movement towards the anarchist ideal.

IJA 1994-96 .

As mentioned, after the referendum the CNN (after a little help from the
AIT/AIIS) reported: "an almost perfect society" etc, about the Norwegian
economic-political system. And this was a good thing because a) the bad
losers of the EU-referendum, say, the matriarch Gro Harlem Brundtland and
Utenriksdepartementet, The Norwegian Foreign Department, sent out harmful
authoritarian propaganda and disinformation, telling Norway was or would be
a populist, nationalist, mercantilist, "nisselueland", with a bad economy,
on TV etc. internationally, and thus b) the Norwegian exchange rate and
prices of shares turned downwards, the interest rate went upwards, and
Norway would probably be sent into an economical depression with large
unemployment, if not c) Lou Dobbs at CNN and other international newsmedia
had reported the truth - that the Norwegian economy was very sound, and the
economical political system was sound, and indicated it would probably be
more sound, and d) thus the exchange rate went upwards, the value of the
shares rised again, and interest rate went down, and thus a hike in the
interest rate and a depression with big unemployment were avoided. 

Afterwards the Norwegian economy relatively has been one of the strongest in
the world, but if Gro Harlem Brundtland and UD had managed to start a bad
economical spiral downwards, as they were up to, the Norwegian economy would
perhaps never recovered and be as good as it has been over the years passing
by since 1994."Thanks to Lou, the editors of CNN and other international
media supporting AIT and the new anarchist political economical system of
Norway in the early days of the revolutionary change. Perhaps we all
togheter "changed the world" slightly, slightly, slightly i.e. at least on
behalf of Anarchism in Norway and the Norwegian people. It must be clear
that the relevant press releases sent by telefax from AIT to CNN etc. before
and soon after the EU-referendum, also of course accounted for the friendly
replies from Lou Dobbs at CNN and the other international media on the air,
via the influence on the economy, probably were worth billions to the
Norwegian people a.o.t., in the following years", says A. Quist, the
internationally well known anarchofeminist and co-writer of the
Anarchofeminist Manifesto of 1982. 

A brief summary of the most important information and press releases sent
from the AIT/AIIS before and after the EU-referendum 1994-95, and the
responding of the international newsmedia-giants, was published in IJ@/Fb No
4 (24) 1994, 1 (25) and 2 (25) 1995. NB! When reading the IJ@/Fb No 4 (24)
1994, 1 (25) and 2 (25) 1995, etc, the text should be interpreted according
to the updated research front of anarchism today. Say a.o.t., the concept of
the degree of anarchy has been more strictly defined, and is no longer used
for systems outside the anarchist quadrant of the Economical-Political map,
using instead the authoritarian degree (or the libertarian degree broadly
defined, including semilibertarian degree = 100% - the authoritarian
degree). The most basic mathematical ecocirc formulas related to the
Economical-Political map have of course not been changed, but the words used
per definition in this connection have been changed a bit to make it a bit
more clear what is anarchist and what is not, i.e. semilibertarian and
authoritarian. The situation during the anarchist revolutionary change was
quite dramatic, especially in the days just around the referendum and the
following months. All in all, the marxist matriarch Gro Harlem Brundtland
and her authoritarian government got a real economic-political uppercut,
that changed the system into anarchism of low degree.

IJ@/Fb No 4 (24) reported: EU-strategien ble i hovedsak lagt i 1988, og

kontrast til regjeringspropagandaen. Dermed var bordet duket for det
anarkistiske alternativet, som kom med korrekt informasjon, i motsetning til
Ja-regjeringens desinformasjon. Og sÂ begynte ballen Â rulle... F¯r
folkeavstemningen i Sverige sendte vi [bl.a] en melding med overskriften
"Sweden and Norway: Say no!".

Mange anarkister deltok ogsÂ i den generelle NEI til EU folkebevegelsen,
IJ@/Fb hadde argumentert aktivt mot EU i flere Âr, og man hadde kj¯rt frem
disse argumentene i en rekke fora. Ragnar Frischs artikkel om "Det uopplyste
pengevelde", med brodd mot EU, ble trykt opp igjen og sirkulerte i
¯konom-kretser, etc. Det var en kjempemobilisering frem til
folkeavstemningen. I Sverige ble det jo ja-flertall, og i Norge nei. Den
internasjonale pressen hadde imidlertid fÂtt et helt feilaktig inntrykk av
grunnen til nei-et i Norge, og dette avspeilte seg bl.a i de f¯rste
nyhetssendingene pÂ CNN, SKY og TV5. Det var da det var pÂ tide Â markere
seg som et bedre alternativ til UD's Ja-propaganda. Vi sendte til hele det
internasjonale nettet, men tar her bare med utgaven til CNN.To CNN: Please
stop spreading disinformation about the Norwegian EU-referendum. There were
no significant "Nationalistic" and "Non-internationalistic" arguments in the
debate. The main argument goes like this (in academic terms): NORWAY SAYS
"NO"! 

1. Membership in The European Union represents probably a movement towards
more [degree of] statism and capitalism, and thus towards less efficient
production, less justice, and larger difference in rank and income, i.e. a
movement away from anarchy [NB! this was a situation of an anarchist
revolutionary change, the authoritarian tendencies of the marxian matriarchy
was crushed, and the Anarchy of Norway was emerging, but was not yet quite
stabile] in authoritarian direction. The feminist, environmental and
intergenerational perspectives are also included in this analysis. 

2. A vast majority among The Anarchists in Norway and Sweden think so, and
voted NO at the referendums. 3. The Norwegian and Swedish People in general
were advocated to do the same: Vote NO to membership in The European Union
at the referendum! 4. In Sweden and Norway the majority of the people voted
NO, but the bureaucracy and its ramifications voted yes at large. The larger
and shrewder Swedish bureaucracy managed to defeat the people, but the
Norwegian did not. Thus [after the anarchist revolutionary change] Norway
confirmed its position as a land with relatively high degree of anarchy, and
- together with Switzerland country - a lighthouse for the authoritarian
European Union. Og det gikk ikke mange minuttene f¯r CNN endret pÂ
reportasjene. Det ble snakket om "the almost perfect society" (= anarki)
[Say, Lou Dobbs and other reporters at CNN were clearly responding to the
AIT/AIIS press releases] etc, og alt pratet om nasjonalisme og nisselue ble
s¯kk borte. Dessuten ble reportasjen utvidet betraktelig. Dette hadde ogsÂ
en positiv effekt pÂ avisene i USA, og New York b¯rsen. Kronekursen gikk opp
og renten ned. 

The fight for the velvet anarchist revolution was however not yet over - and
it developed into a permanent revolution, it was necessary to crush repeated
contrarevolutionary attacks, from the Yes to EU organizations and statist
and/or capitalist tendencies in general. Say, soon after the referendum a
contrarevolutionary attack from the Yes-ministers - and some private
bureaucratical tendencies aiming at economical plutarchy - tried to stop
foreign investment in Norway - and recommended large scale
"outflagging/utflagging" for the Norwegian investors as well, and thus stab
a dagger in the back of the new, emerging, anarchist system. The aim was
probably to start an economical depression, and thus clear the ground for a
new EU referendum and perhaps a Yes majority later on, based on a.o.t. the
argument "What did we say before the referendum! The political economy in
Norway will be bad, if the country doesn't become a member of the European
Union". Anyway a call for a new referendum was mentioned in the newsmedia.
Det ble snakket om krise i norsk nÊringsliv og om kapitalflukt fra Norge,
samt investeringer i Sverige, og dette mÂtte naturligvis ogsÂ motvirkes. 

Dermed var det duket for en ny pressemelding [til CNN, SKY-NEWS, TV5, etc,
men ogsÂ til norsk presse], som ogsÂ ble fulgt opp av den internasjonale
pressen, og kronekursen gikk ytterligere opp og renten ned. Dermed var
sannheten om Norges relativt gode ¯konomi festet i den internasjonale
opinionen sÂ langt: Investment in production v.s. bureaucracy: An
interesting social experiment takes place in Scandinavia. Two countries,
Norway and Sweden, with approximately the same type economic-political
system... initially, have chosen different connection to Europe. Sweden has
joined The European Union, and Norway has not. A comparative analysis so far
shows the following: Sweden will invest approximately 2 billions US $ next
year in net contigent to the EU-bureacracy, i.e. "for a seat in Brussel",
while Norway will save about 1 billion $, which may be used for productive
investments. The Swedish are discussing who's going to pay the bill. Perhaps
somebody will try to put it indirectly on foreign investment etc. in Sweden,
rather than pay it themselves? This payment, i.e. via more taxes, is a.o.t.
just what happened later on. Investigations of the development in
unemployment, median and average income, bureaucracy and system cost, and
other economical indicators, indicate a relative success for the Anarchy of
Norway compared to the EU-bureaucratic Sweden, also seen apart from the net
benefits from the oil-industry. 

The bureaucratic authoritarian rule of the marxian matriarch had kept the
Norwegian political-economical system both inefficient and unfair, based on
statism: "Gro Harlem Brundtland har pÂ sin side hatt makta, og hun har visst
Â bruke den... historien om en politiker-gruppes kamp mot folket... Ei lekse
i maktbruk." slo Nationen fast 29.11.1994, i.e. meaning something like Gro
Harlem Brundtland had very much had the power and used it in a rather
machiavellian way. And this was most likely a very correct observation. The
anarchist revolution changed the Norwegian economical political system
towards somewhat less authoritarian tendencies, the system moving also bit
to the right, passing the border from the marxian social-democrat to the
anarchist quadrant on the economical-political map. The grip of the statism
of the marxist matriarch loosened, the degree of statism was reduced a few
percent in the following time, following the megatrend towards more
autonomy. The marxist matriarch stopped being a matriarch, i.e ruler, in
real terms, retiring to a passive administrative role. The marxist
Dagsavisen had a retrospective article 18.04.2009 headlined "Dr. Gro og Mrs.
Hyde" and also stating Gro as "En sosialdemokratisk variant av Kim Il Sung".
Gro was Mrs Hyde and a social-democratic variant of Kim Il Sung, until the
anarchist revolution i 1994/95, but then became the less authoritarian Dr.
Gro, and the system seen all in all became an anarchy of low degree, with ca
53% degree of anarchy. 

The message to the foreign and domestic investors were: At the moment it
seems like Norway is the most interesting for domestic and foreign
investment. Better to invest in a stabil anarchy compared to a growing
bureaucratic chaos. Ja-siden la jo ikke inn Ârene av den grunn, og hver gang
det har toppet seg, har vi stÂtt pÂ... og vi har gode relasjoner til f.eks
CNN og SKY-NEWS, som et pÂlitelig alternativt pressebyrÂ... And both foreign
and domestic realinvestments in Norway continued in a reasonable way,
compared to Sweden and the European Union in general.

15.12.1994 the contrarevolutionary tendencies against the new established
Anarchy, the bad losers call for a new referendum and trying to sabotage the
people's clear No majority -- were halted somewhat for a while when the
editor KÂre Valebrokk of the industrial-paper Dagens NÊringsliv, in a one
page commercial in Aftenposten, the largest non-tabloid Norwegian newspaper,
a) with a picture of the internationally well known Norwegian anarchist and
play-writer Henrik Ibsen declaring his famous word of wisdom "Bedst var det,
kan hÊnde, det gik, som det gik...", and b) himself adding a.o.t. "Hva var
det vi mistet, hva var det vi fikk... Det er nye tider nÂ.", indicating it
was after all best that the result at the referendum was No to the European
Union, and not Yes, and that an anarchist economical-political system was
established. The AIT/AIIS press release titled "KÂre vs Gro", published
23.12.2002 reported a.o.t. about this, and also

a) that the PM Gro Harlem Brundtland had no credibility after telling lies
for open TV-screen about the LO's (workers' union) statement against the EU
in the main EU-debate program at the NRK-TV, the Norwegian public
broadcasting, just before the referendum, Brundtland saying wrongly the LO
was for the European Union, and that 

b) it was generally not a good thing for a prime minister to loose self
control and telling lies in public, at critical situations, - as she did,
however not only this time, but several times mentioned in the newsmedia. 

The fight against contrarevolutionary tendencies had to continue, and still
goes on.... The debates, reflecting the peoples perspective via the public
room, about the European Union and Norwegian politics for the 21st century
in general, arranged by Folkebladet - at www.anarchy.no, clearly show that
the fight against authoritarian and non-anarchist tendencies is still very
much on the agenda in Norway.

22.05.1995 dokumenterte Dagens NÊringsliv over en dobbeltside "hvordan
ja-sidens dommedagsprofetier er gjort til skamme": "Alt har gÂtt bedre i
norsk ¯konomi siden Norge sa nei til EU 28. november i fjor. Renten har
falt, veksten har ¯kt, budsjettunderskuddet er forduftet og investeringene
skyter i vÊret". DN reported about major improvements in the economy
22.05.1995.

The connection between AIT/AIIS and CNN in those years (1994-95) was
officially confirmed in a letter from a CNN/Turner official indicating
a.o.t. the information from AIT/AIIS was interesting and intelligent. As
this is perhaps a political document of some interest we will describe it a
bit more. The envelope has the Turner logo and the sender organization's
name is "Turner Broadcasting International Limited", addressed to S. Olsen,
Anarkistenes Informasjonstjeneste, c/o F.B. P.B. 4777 Sofienberg N - 0506
Oslo, Norway. The letter, dated 7 March 1995, says a.o.t. the following:
"Dear S. Olsen, Thank you very much for comments on the network's
programming. We appreciate your feedback... We [however] do not have the
capacity to reply to each of your faxes in turn. They are very informative
but also quite substantial!... Thank you for your cooperation. With best
whises, Dale Langley - Press Officer. CNN INTERNATIONAL," i.e. at the CNN's
London office, UK. "Well, 'plenty all right - too much no good' as one of
the AI councillors often says, - anyway the AIIS/AI spread the telefaxes on
different offices of CNN and other newsmedia to be more cooperative. The
main point is that CNN and other newsmedia responded to several of the
AIIS/AI faxes in their news. 

As mentioned, soon after the No-vote was known, the CNN and othe main
international newsmedia reported that this was due to "Nationalistic" and
"Non-internationalistic" [authoritarian, backwards] tendencies, based on
disinformation from the Yes to EU government in Norway. However the
Anarchist International Information Service AIIS - Anarkistenes
Informasjonstjenest AIT - minutes after these newsreports faxed a message to
main international newsmedia, including CNN, stating that Norway was
libertarian, and [soon] anarchist. Soon after the CNN responded to the
AIIS-faxes and changed the news, reporting about: "an almost perfect
society", regarding the Norwegian economic-political system. Also other main
international newsmedia changed their reports in a similar way. They however
did not mention AIIS as a source, but they clearly responded by changing the
news according to the facts from AIIS. In the next weeks and months the AIIS
sent several faxes clearing up disinformation from the Yes-to EU government,
which international newsmedia, including CNN, responded to in a similar way.
The letter from CNN confirms that the CNN responded in this way to some, but
not all, of the faxes from AIIS.

Our aim of those days a) was not necessarily that CNN, SKY-NEWS, French TV5,
EURONEWS, etc., and the large internationally distributed newspapers, say,
New York Times, Washington Post, etc, should reply and respond to all of the
information we sent, but to have some influence in anarchist direction if
possible, b) we sent much about the anarchist economical political system in
Norway, anarchism and other -isms, and libertarian policy in general, so the
giant international newsmedia could have an alternative to the governments'
and tendencies towards authoritarian and authorities' -- propaganda, and a
lot of information in the libertarian field of research, - for the
newsmediagiants to choose from in a freedomly way. And our, the AIT/AIIS's,
influence via the international media must of course not be exaggerated at
all, however when we had a new, good and sound argument in libertarian
direction perhaps it had a slight influence indirectly or directly, now and
then, on what was sent on the air, i.e. the CNN network's programming and
other newsmedia's. But the usual "manufacturing of consent" according to
Noam Chomsky's research, where the media are acting more as the 4th power of
the State, in societal perspective, than a free press, was in those days, as
well as today, clearly the main tendency. 

There is however possibly a slight development towards more free newsmedia
reporting in a libertarian way, say less Brown Card convicts of the
International Anarchist Tribunal, over time from 1994 and until now. But
this is probably due to a libertarian megatrend, and perhaps not much
related to the work of AIT/AIIS" says S. Olsen, spokesperson of AIT/AIIS,
reflecting over the past work of the anarchist newsagency, at the time when
the now rather outdated telefax-machines of the AIT/AIIS network were used a
lot, and of the replies from the giant international newsmedia: "I guess
David had much more luck against the giant Goliath -- and the militants
using the Trojan horse in the old days also --, than we had vis-‡-vis the
international and domestic newsmedia, but now and then the AIT/AIIS
'underdog' anarchist news agency probably managed to hit the many headed
giant international media-troll so it made a slight change of behavior in
libertarian direction, i.e. the troll hit the authorities or went against
authoritarian tendencies, or (very rare) supported anarchism more directly,
especially internationally. 

But seen all in all, a) the influence of AIT/AIIS news and comments related
to the EU-referendum in 1994-95 via the international newsmedia, was
probably the most important and direct, b) the influence in general, outside
what is reported about case a) in IJ@/Fb No 4 (24) 1994, 1 (25) and 2 (25)
1995, must not be exaggerated, and was probably usually quite marginal if
any at all, - however c) a useful network was established and d) AIT/AIIS
got a reputation about beeing a serious anarchist newsagency and source for
libertarian information, that still holds good today.

Today, in the days of Internet and e-mails, we have reports about several
anarchist journalists in different newsmedia, and the www.anarchy.no and IJ@
etc. get a lot of interesting feedback in general. Anarchy is on the air as
never before according to reports, i.e. in a positive way, but anarchism has
still not achieved much influence on the media in general, i.e. say, about
proportional to having 25% of the area on the economical political map. This
may perhaps to some extent be due to problems with the double meaning of the
word rule in anglophone languages, meaning both A. "regel = relatively fixed
ways to settle things in an orderly way, i.e. regulations and regulatory
means" and B. "herske/archein" in Norwegian/Greek, from hersker/archos, i.e.
be and/or act as an arch, authoritarian, bestiality. 

This problem represents an anglophone Orwellian "1984" "newspeak and
doublethinking" tendency, as only the meaning B. of the word rule is
relevant in anarchist context. AIIS/AIT has however plans of continuing the
information work, domestic and internationally, now as the official
newsagency of the Anarchist International, and hope for good co-operation
with the domestic and international news-mediagiants, both generally and in
especially important cases. An aim is over time to increase the percentage
'marketshare' in the meaning of the amount of covering about anarchy and
anarchism defined in a libertarian, i.e. realistic - not authoritarian, way,
in the media." 

The development of the libertarian/anarchist degree in Norway related to the
velvet revolution and revolutionary change in 1994/95 is estimated to the
following: 11-27.11.1994 = ca 49,4% (state) ; 28-29.11.1994 = ca 51%
(anarchy) ; 01.03.1995 = ca 52% ; 01.06.1995 = ca 53% ; 01.10.1995 = ca 53%,
a stabilized anarchy of low degree. The system made a " ) " shaped move from
about [= ca] 49,4% libertarian degree and located close to the middlepoint
of the map within the marxist quadrant 11-27.11.1994, toward the star on the
map in the middle of 1995, with ca 53% degree of anarchism. 

The libertarian music of the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/fabs.html&gt; FABS, the
Federalist Anarchist Beat Society, was a major source of inspiration for the
Anarchist Federation of Norway,  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/afin.html&gt; AFIN, and
the Anarchist International Information Service, AIIS, during the velvet
revolutionary change, and in general, now and before. FABS was mentioned in
FB/IJA 2(24) 1994... 

In 2009 a book about the struggle against EU-membership, etc., called "Makta
midt imot" - "Directly opposite to the power", by Kjell-Erik Nordenson
Kallset, was published, see  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/eu.html&gt; the people's
official EU-debate for more information. 28.11.1994 is celebrated as the Day
of the Anarchist Revolution in Norway, by libertarians.

The center of gravity in Norwegian politics has been littte over the middle
of the economic-political map since 1994/95.

The symbolic king is totally powerless

The king in the Anarchy of Norway is only a symbolic king without power and
command

The rumors that the Norwegian king is powerful and commander of the armed
forces, based on the Norwegian constitution, are not true. The king of
Norway is only a symbolic king. He has no power at all. He is  in reality
not a commander of anything, and not the army, which is an antimilitarist
corps in Norway. 

Norway as the Swiss Confederation and Iceland are anarchies of low degree.
This means there are authoritarian tendencies. The anarchy degree of Norway
is about 54% (since 2002) , which means the authoritarian degree is about
46%, but it is still the most libertarian/anarchist country in the world.
The anarchists in Norway try to increase the anarchy/libertarian degree, but
it goes slow and is difficult. If you have any ideas on how the anarchy
degree can be increased quickly, you are very welcome.

AI knows the Norwegian constitution. It is quite misleading because it
partly deals with formal and symbolic power, and not realities. There is
constitutional custom and practice which prove this. The king is only a
symbolic king, the Council of State ñ which is based on the parliament
(Storting), has the role of  a cabinet. The king has no power at all. 

While radical in its day, the constitution of 1814 was a product of its age.
As Norwegian democracy developed, some parts of it began to look
increasingly dated. For example, the executive power, which in the
constitution is consistently attributed to the king, came increasingly to
rest in his Council of State (statsrÂd). Similarly, the king originally had
the right to appoint members of the Council, who were answerable to him
alone, and they could not be chosen from the members of the Storting. With
the establishment of parliamentarism 1884, the Council was effectively
chosen by general election, in that the king appointed only members of the
party or coalition having a majority in the Storting. Further, the Council
became answerable to the Storting, in the sense that a failed vote of
confidence would cause the Council of State to resign. 

You better believe us, because this is the truth. AI and the Norwegian
anarchists deal with realities, not formal and symbolic things. As
mentioned, the king is only a symbolic king, he is without any power and
without command in reality. In real terms Norway is an anarchy of low
degree, although formally a monarchy. Anarchists (and AI) are interested in
realities, not formal and symbolic issues. Long live the Anarchy of Norway!

The anarchy of Norway is still going strong

Some time has passed on since the Norwegian People turned their back against
the main economic political course of the social democrat government, at the
1994 EU referendum. The megatrend of the late eighties and early nineties
was a movement to the right and upwards on the Economical Political Map. The
EU referendum indicated a further jump in this direction, and thus the
economic political system in Norway made a revolutionary change, and passed
the border between the marxist social democrat sector and the anarchist
sector of social individualism. This of course is a major social event in
the economic political world history. A long jump further rightwards may
result in a social liberal system, and a reverse tendency may give a
retardation to marxist social democracy, but this is not the case at the
moment. Thus, Norway became an anarchy in 1994/95, and it still is an
anarchist economic-political system. 

And thus, the Anarchy of Norway is still going strong. Although the system
is significantly anarchist, i.e. within the Quadrant of Anarchism on the
economic political map, it is somewhat far from the anarchist ideal on the
top of the map. "So this is heaven: Norway", the LA-TIMES in USA reports
about Norway, November 2001, but this is however a bit exaggerated; see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/report1.html&gt; American look at Norway - Report no 1,
where the article is quoted, with comments from IIFOR added. Another
American article on the situation in Norway, quoted from NY-TIMES January
2002, also with comments from IIFOR, is also included. 

The main policy of the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; Anarchist
International (AI/IFA) and The Anarchist Federation of Norway (
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/afin.html&gt; AFIN) was presented in the largest
Newspaper in Norway, Verdens Gang 06.11.2001, p 39, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/vg1html.html&gt; Anarchy is [real] democracy - article
in VG. This article also states "Norway [as] a relatively anarchist country,
however a bit far from the anarchist ideal (Norge som et relativt
anarkistisk land, men noksÂ langt fra det anarkistiske ideal)." 

In June 2002 a libertarian direct action against the World Bank's
reactionary policy and the ABCDE-meeting, in Oslo, once more confirmed that
anarchy is significantly on in Norway, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/abcde.html&gt; Direct action against the ABCDE-meeting
and policy. 

Norwegian firms are more and more horizontally organized, according to
Nordhaug and Gooderham at NHH (Dagsavisen 15 &amp; 16.10.2004). 

A degree of anarchism of ca 54%, as in Norway 2013 is as mentioned not a
high degree of anarchism. This means the authoritarian degree is still ca
46%. If the libertarian degree is less than 50% there is no anarchy at all.
About 54% anarchy degree is quite an accepted estimate. It is a.o.t. quoted
in Dagens NÊringsliv (the Industrial life of today, the main economical
newspaper of Norway) no 2/3 June 2007 and Finansavisen (the Financial
newspaper) Wednesday 17. October 2007, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/dnfa.html&gt; anarchist articles in DN and Finansavisen.


30.05.2007. The Anarchy of Norway was rated as the most peaceful nation in
the world, and since the middle of 1995 the country has also been ranked as
the most libertarian and anarchist on planet Gaia, a.k.a. Tellus and Earth.

15.01.2010. Positive citizen survey: A nationwide citizen survey shows that
86 per cent of Norwegians think that their country is close to being a
perfect country to live in.

02.11.2011. Flat hierarchy challenges new leaders. Norway's "flat, flat,
flat" management hierarchy [i.e. not topheavy pyramid economically and/or
political/adminstrative] poses a huge challenge for new leaders recruited
from overseas. It can also explain why there's so few of them within the
Norwegian business world. "Many leaders can feel so disrespected when they
come to Norway," said Kimberly Lein-Mathisen, global alliance leader for the
large US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Everyone is equal, and employees
are accustomed to being consulted on most matters, and having their say.
Source:  &lt;http://www.newsinenglish.no&gt; www.newsinenglish.no.

So called heaven or not, 54% anarchism is far from the 100% anarchist ideal.
Thus, it is plenty of room for improvement from anarchist perspective, and
by no means time for a break in the fight against authoritarian tendencies.
The revolution must be fought permanent, in the daily life, to sustain and
develop further. However, as long as a) Norway stays out of EU, b) populist
and nationalist tendencies are put at place, and c) the left and right
tendencies outbalance each other reasonable as by now, Norway will probably
stay anarchist, and be a lighthouse for EU and the rest of the world.

Anarchy = here social-individualist anarchism; Soc. dem. = social democrat
marxism; Populist = here moderate parliamentarian democratic fascism; Cons.
lib. = Conservative liberalism. See economic-political map above. Ranking of
countries according to libertarian degree, estimates of the libertarian
degree in general, and information on methodology, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ranking.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/ranking.html and
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html. We
have used " , ", the European standard instead of American/UK standard, i.e.
" . " as decimal separator. The term "ca" is an abbreviation for the latin
circa, which means about or approximately. 

Anarchy and anarchism mean "system and management without ruler(s), i.e.
co-operation without repression, tyranny and slavery". In short an-arch-y =
[(an = without - arch = ruler(s)) - y = system (included optimal order and
law) and management, as, say, in monarch-y]. Anarchy and anarchism are
efficient and fair system and management without top heavy societal pyramid
economical and/or political/administrative - in income and/or rank, i.e.
significant horizontal organization - real democracy. The anarchy degree is
100% - the authoritarian degree within the anarchist quadrant on the
economic-political map (see map above). The libertarian degree is 100% - the
authoritarian degree all over the map. 

The word anarchy origins from greek. The prefix "an" means "negation of" as
in anaerobe versus aerobe and "arch" means "superior, i.e. in contrast to
subordinates", as in archbishop, archangel, archduke, arch villain, etc.
Thus anarchy, anarchism, anarchist, a.s.o., mean coordination on equal
footing, without superiors and subordinates, i.e. horizontal organization
and co-operation without coercion - practically (significant,  &gt; 50% anarchy
degree) or ideally (towards 100% anarchy degree). Anarchy has equal to or
more than 50% anarchy degree.

Anarchy is organization in general without (significant) arch(s), but not
without management. The influence on the management, economic and
political/administrative, in private and public sector, goes in general more
from the bottom - the people and grassroots - upwards, than from the top
downwards. At the middle-point of the map the influence from the bottom is
50%. At the top of the map, the anarchist ideal, the influence from the
bottom is 100%, or the organization is without top, 100% flat. Norway, The
Swiss Confederation and Iceland are anarchies of low degree (anarchy degree
&gt; 50% but less than 60%). Other countries are more or less authoritarian
(significant, &gt; 50% authoritarian degree).

 ¬† ¬† 

For the past 16 years, the Cuban 5 have spent Christmas (Navidad) in jail for protecting American and Cuban citizens from Terrorism!

As we enter this joyous and generous holiday season, give the Cuban 5 the gift of SOLIDARITY!

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 is calling on all our freedom loving supporters to send President Obama this Christmas letter asking that he release the Cuban 5.

This may seem simple and insignificant, but our collective action has the power to make freedom happen!¬† Historically, letter writing campaigns have successfully pressured prison officials to release prisoners from¬† solitary confinement; forced the Bureau of Prisons to provide adequate medical attention to prisoners; and have ensured prisoners win parole.

One letter means nothing, but multiply it by several thousand and it will show President Obama undeniable proof that the Cuban 5 have supporters that care about them and want them to be set FREE!

Please take 10 minutes of your time to print this letter, sign it, put it into an envelope and put it into the mailbox on your way to work, school, church, or your next protest.¬† I think we can all agree that this small commitment of your time is nothing compared to the YEARS¬† the Cuban 5 have spent in jail.

Happy Holidays!¬† Merry Christmas!¬† FREE THE CUBAN 5!

The Venceremos BrigadeAnsonia Station, P.O. Box 230527, New York, NewYork 10023 Website: www.venceremosbrigade.net Email: vbrigade@...¬†December 17, 2014 will be remembered as a joyful day in thehistory of Cuba-US relations.¬† ¬†On this day, our three brothers, Gerardo, Antonio, andRam√≥n, were released from US prisons after more than 16 years of unjustincarceration.¬† They were reunited intheir homeland with their families, with their comrades, Ren√© and Fernando, andwith the people of Cuba, who have been engaged in an unwavering struggle fortheir freedom since 1998.¬† ¬†On this day, too, President Obama announced some of the mostsignificant changes in US policy toward Cuba since diplomatic ties were brokenin 1961, two years after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution.¬† These changes are to include the restorationof diplomatic relations between our two countries, further loosening of the banon travel to Cuba from the US, easing of trade and financial restrictions, andincreased cooperation in the fields of health care, disaster response, andtelecommunications, among others.¬†The Venceremos Brigade proudly stands with people ofconscience all across the world in celebrating this historic victory for theCuban people and the international solidarity movement.¬†The release of the remaining members of the Cuban 5 is atestament to the heroic strength of each one of these men and to the collectiveresistance of the Cuban people and their government.¬† It affirms what we have maintained since ourbrothers were arrested: that theirs was a political case determined bypolitical factors; that they were political prisoners; and that a solutionwould only be motivated by political calculations.¬† Indeed, this is, above all, a political victory, won through years oftireless struggle in all corners of the globe‚Äîa victory made possible bysolidarity.¬† ¬†Likewise, the move toward normalization of relations betweenthe US and Cuba represents a momentous political victory for the Cuban people,their revolution, and their allies.¬† Overmore than 50 years, Cuba has built and successfully defended its revolutionagainst relentless aggression from the US government.¬† Facing the most powerful enemy on the planet,the people of Cuba have waged a battle of ideas and demonstrated through unity,discipline, and sacrifice that even a poor country burdened by an inhumaneblockade can feed, clothe, and house all its people, provide them with anadequate and equitable education, and share their resources with those in needaround the world.¬† The policy changesannounced by Obama, though not framed this way in the US media, must be seen asan admission of Cuba‚Äôs success and proof that another world is not onlypossible, but exists.¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†On December 17, alongside our Cuban friends, vencimos‚Äîwe overcame.¬† But our work is not done.¬† While we applaud President Obama‚Äôs decision,we know there is still much to overcome.¬†The travel ban and blockade arestill in place.¬† Obama may do allthat he can to relax travel and trade restrictions, but Congress must be madeto act in order to fully normalize US-Cuba relations.¬† This is a time for celebration, but also atime for analysis, vigilance, and action.¬†We must not be complacent in our success; rather, we must use the energyfrom this victory to redouble our efforts toward the complete lifting of thecriminal blockade and unconstitutional travel restrictions.¬† As members in the vanguard of the internationalmovement in solidarity with Cuba, it is our duty to keep the pressure on‚Äîto continue, as we have for 45 years, todefend Cuba‚Äôs national sovereignty and right to self-determination, and totrust that the Cuban people will do the rest.¬†Today, this mission isas important as ever.¬† As masses ofpeople are rising up against racist state terror and proclaiming that BlackLives Matter, it is imperative that we lift up Cuba as an alternative model ofsocial development based on the principles of equality and solidarity.¬† We must draw the connections between thestruggle to affirm the value of black life and the struggle to defend arevolutionary society from attack by the same forces responsible for the deathsof Mike Brown, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Eric Garner, Tarika Wilson, and many, manymore.¬† We must understand and learn fromCuba‚Äôs great victory not only in terms of its overcoming US imperialism, butalso‚Äîand especially in this moment‚Äîin terms of its historic commitment toracial justice and international unity.¬†We must remember Cuba‚Äôs decisive contributions to the movements forAfrican liberation, Cuba‚Äôs leading role in battling Ebola in West Africa, andCuba‚Äôs principled decision to grant political asylum to Assata Shakur.¬† Now more than ever, when we assert Cuba‚Äôssovereignty and right to national self-determination, we defend this past,present, and future.¬† ¬†We urge you to join the Venceremos Brigade in this historicmoment by:¬† ¬†   
   - Calling (202-456-1111)or emailingPresident Obama to thank him and let him know you support full normalization ofrelations with Cuba.¬†
   - Calling or emailing your Senators andCongressional Representatives to let them know you support the repeal of theHelms-Burton and Torricelli Acts and an end to the blockade and travelrestrictions in their entirety.¬†
   - Donatingby check to the VB Education Fund, Ansonia Station, P.O.Box 230527, New York, New York 10023 ¬†
