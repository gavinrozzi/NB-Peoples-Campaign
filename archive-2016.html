Brown Cards to Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, Fareed Zakaria
GPS, and CNN. 
Rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - and ultra-fascism, in Syria,
Iraq and Libya etc., not anarchy.

15.02.2016 Peter Bergen at Fareed Zakaria GPS on CNN is misusing the word
anarchy pointing to some countries in the Middle East, say Syria, Iraq and
Libya etc. It is not true that these States are anarchies. The truth is that
Syria, Iraq and Libya etc. are failed states, with rivaling polyarchy with
ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - and ultra-fascist, not anarchy. The International
Anarchist Tribunal (IAT) hands out Brown Cards to Peter Bergen, CNN's
national security analyst, Fareed Zakaria GPS, and CNN, for this Orwellian
newspeak misusing the word anarchy, and breaking the Oslo Convention. The
only anarchies in the world are Norway, the Swiss Confederation and Iceland.
They are also very good for people to live in. So Bergen is also wrong when
he said "The only thing that is worse than dictatorship is anarchy". Anarchy
is real democracy, not rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - and
ultra-fascism.

ANARCHY VS ECONOMIC-POLITICAL CHAOS
FAILED STATES ARE STATES - ARCHIES - NOT ANARCHY

The modern, updated definitions of state and anarchy 

1. Authoritarians notoriously mix up anarchy, anarchist and anarchism with
authoritarian tendencies: Chaos, disorder, mob rule (narrowly defined),
lawlessness, the law of the jungle, criminality, riots, theft, corruption,
drugs, mafia, terrorism, autocratic rule, the right to the strongest,
antisocial tyrannic behavior, etc. i.e. different types of superiors and
subordinates. The Greek rooted word for mob rule is ochlarchy. Ochlarchy
broadly defined may also be used as a common word for all the authoritarian
evils mentioned above, i.e. in general lack of security and law and order in
a society as a public sector service. This is ochlarchy, the opposite of
anarchy, i.e. based on libertarian law and order and security as public
sector services, according to the anarchist (IFA) principle of social
justice. The ochlarchists/ochlarchs are rulers of chaos, with equal to or
more than 666 per thousand (67%) authoritarian degree, i.e. very evil. This
also includes very chaotic, authoritarian social systems, i.e., say,
rivaling polyarchy/oligarchy with ochlarchy. State in a broad societal
meaning is systems with significantly large rank and/or income differences
and/or inefficient, i.e. significantly vertically organized, also chaotic.
Chaotic states, with rivaling polyarchy or oligarchy and ochlarchy, are
failed states, archies, not anarchies. 

2. The word anarchy origins from greek. The prefix "an" means "negation of"
as in anaerobe versus aerobe and "arch" means "superior, i.e. in contrast to
subordinates", as in archbishop, archangel, archduke, arch villain, etc.
Thus anarchy, anarchism, anarchist, a.s.o., mean coordination on equal
footing, without superiors and subordinates, i.e. horizontal organization
and co-operation without coercion, ideally or practically. Anarchy,
[an-arch]-y means [an = without, arch = ruler(s)]-y = system, management as
in monarch-y. Thus anarchy and anarchism mean "system and management without
ruler(s), i.e. co-operation without repression, tyranny and slavery". That
is economic and political/administrative, societal, management from the
people, grassroots, and upwards - significantly, without a top heavy pyramid
in rank and/or income, i.e. without a top - down approach. And thus
anarchies are systems with significantly small rank and income differences,
plus efficiency, i.e. significantly horizontally organized. This is the
opposite of the above mentioned authoritarian tendencies, i.e. different
types of superiors and subordinates, a top - down approach, chaos - and
rulers of chaos... state, also failed states. 

3. These modern, updated definitions of state vs anarchy are a.o.t. opposed
to Max Weber's outdated definitions. We think everybody should stick to
these modern, updated definitions, and not use arbitrary or Max Weber's
outdated definitions. It is important to see the real difference between
anarchies and states, including failed states, and not mix up states with
anarchy, that is quite something else. In general, necessary for anarchy and
anarchism is a functioning central administration, with law and order,
significantly horizontally organized. A breakdown of the central
administration, be it government/state/authority or significantly
horizontally organized, creates a failed state, see above, and not anarchy.
Wrongly calling states, including failed states, anarchies is authoritarian
Orwellian "1984" newspeak, and should be avoided. Authoritarian marxist,
liberalist and populist/fascist propaganda stations often present failed
states wrongly as anarchies. The IAT issues Brown Cards in this connection,
see below... 

Very chaotic states - failed states 

In the 1990s and later several examples of very chaotic, authoritarian
systems have been registered, say, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Liberia, Rwanda,
Albania, Sierra Leone, Congo, Solomon Islands, Burundi, Iraq, Haiti,
Somalia, Ivory Coast, Kyrgyztan, Zimbabwe, Libya, Syria, etc., and wrongly
called anarchy by some of the media. They are not anarchies according to the
definition 2. above, but clearly states, as defined in 1., mainly failed
states. 

These very authoritarian, chaotic economic-political systems may be marxist,
populist, fascist, nazi, or liberalism in a chaotic manner, but not anarchy,
anarchist or anarchism. When they were reported as "anarchies", i.e. in
reality rivaling polyarchies/oligarchies with ochlarchy, etc, these
countries had an authoritarian degree between ca 70 % - 80 % and thus a
libertarian degree as low as ca 20 % - 30 % , see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ranking.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/ranking.html .
Anarchies have libertarian degree equal to or more than 50%. Some of the
above mentioned states have improved a bit, i.e. they have now a higher
libertarian degree, but not very much. They are all still far from anarchy. 

Brown Card and APT-IAT 

The Anarchist Press Tribunal (the APT branch of the International Anarchist
Tribunal, IAT) issues a BROWN CARD WARNING to the media mixing up anarchy
and very chaotic authoritarian systems, i.e. ochlarchies etc., failed
states, according to the Oslo-convention. Notoriously authoritarian
reporters, spokesmen, etc, breaking the Oslo-convention of 1990 severely or
several times, will receive a BROWN CARD from the Anarchist Press Tribunal
as a symbol of free criticism, see  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html . 

Brown Cards and Brown Card warnings 

APT issues a special Brown Card warning to the editors at World News, CNN
28.06.97, who probably not yet have discovered that Albania has one of the
most authoritarian economic-political systems in Europe, and wrongly call it
"anarchy". The system in Albania is ochlarchy and chaos, i.e. authoritarian
- and thus not anarchy. The capitalistic pyramid mob rule of Berisha &amp; Co,
and the chaotic ochlarchy initiated by marxists, are by no means anarchy or
anarchist, i.e. horizontal organization and co-operation without coercion,
i.e. repression. 

A similar Brown Card warning is issued to Helge Øgrim, NTB - Aftenposten
18.07.97, about Liberia. The very authoritarian and chaotic
economic-political system of this African country is either marxist,
populist, fascist, nazi, or liberalism, and thus not anarchist or anarchy as
suggested by Helge Øgrim. Another Brown Card goes to Tove Gravdal for mixing
up the more than 666 per thousand authoritarian degree hell in Liberia with
"anarchy" in Aftenposten 12.07.2003. See also Nordic Branch of APT about the
Brown Card to Tove Gravdal. A Brown Card also goes to Barnaby Phillips at
BBC 07.08.2003 for calling the bloody chaos, rivaling polyarchy and
ochlarchy (mob rule) in Monrovia, Liberia, for "anarchy", i.e. quite
misleading. Another Brown Card goes to NRK-Utsyn 16.12.2003 for calling the
violent ochlarchy (mob rule) in Congo, with lack of law and order,
"anarchy". Anarchy and anarchism always have plenty of law and order, i.e.
libertarian law and order based on human rights. If not, the system is
significant authoritarian, and not anarchy and anarchism, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/lov1.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/lov1.html and
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html . Thus,
there is no anarchy in Congo.

06-7.03.2002: BBC News' Emily Buchanan reports about possible "anarchy" in
Sudan and Iraq, probably mixing it up with oligarchy, polyarchy, ochlarchy
and rivaling "states within the state", i.e. in short chaos, the quite
opposite of anarchy, i.e. real democracy and order. This authoritarian mix
of anarchy and chaos gives BBC's Emily B. a Brown Card warning. We'll like
to "see Emily play" with something she understands better in the future...

A similar Brown card warning goes to BBC and NRK Altid Nyheter 17.07.2003
reporting about "the Solomon Islands have been sliding towards anarchy"
lately, probably meaning rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy, chaos and mutual
repression included, and not really anarchy. 

A Brown Card goes to BBC's Ben Brown who reported about the "total chaos of
anarchy" related to the situation in Iraq at BBC TV 11.04.2003. BBC's Ben
Brown also reported 06 &amp; 07.04.2003 about "anarchy" related to the situation
in Basra on BBC TV. - Forget it! You mean chaos, ochlarchy (mob rule) &amp;
rivaling polyarchy, lawlessness and looting (theft) we think, quite the
opposite of anarchy, and thus breaking the Oslo convention, see (click on)
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html . For a
general update on law and anarchism search for "law" in
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html .
See also Nordic branch of APT-IAT about the situation in Iraq after the rule
of Saddam Hussein. The situation in Iraq at the moment is an extreme form of
liberalism, not anarchism.

A Brown Card goes to BBC and NRK-Alltid Nyheter 03.08.2003 reporting about
"lawless anarchy" in Basra, Iraq, for breaking the Oslo convention severely.
The situation in Basra with rivaling polyarchy and "states within the
state", ochlarchy (mob rule), lawlessness, chaos and mutual repression, is
very authoritarian, and thus quite the opposite of anarchy. 20.03.2009 the
authoritarian marxist propaganda station BBC continues to call the situation
i Iraq in 2003 "anarchy", in the false meaning of ochlarchy including chaos,
and gets a fresh Brown Card. 

Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe has 04.11.2003 accused President
Chandrika Kumaratunga of bringing Sri Lanka to the verge of anarchy and
chaos, according to BBC and several other newsmedia. If it is on the verge
of anarchy the country cannot be on the verge of chaos, because anarchy is
quite the opposite of chaos, according to the Oslo Convention, and Ranil
Wickramasinghe gets a Brown Card from IAT-APT together with the newsmedia.
BBC and NRK-Alltid nyheter get a Brown Card for a similar statement about
"anarchy" and chaos in Haiti 10.01.2004. NRK-Urix gets a Brown Card
26.02.2004 for stating "anarkiet hersker", "anarchy rules" in Haiti, wrongly
mixing up "anarchy" with ochlarchy. Anarchy rules ok in Norway since
1994/95, ochlarchy rules in Haiti 2004, and that is not ok. 

25.03.2005 NRK-Dagsrevyen reports about "anarchy" in Kyrgyztan, mixing up
anarchy with rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy, i.e. mob rule broadly
defined, included looting (theft) and chaos, and thus breaking the Oslo
Convention and gets a Brown Card. 26.03.2005 Sveriges Radio reports about
"anarchy" and chaos in Kyrgyztan, and shares the Brown Card with NRK.

29.09.2004 and 06.01.2005: NRK-Alltid Nyheter talks about chaos and
"anarchy" in Somalia, mixing up rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy and chaos with
anarchy, and thus gets a Brown Card. 06.03.2005 NRK- Dagsrevyen reports
about "anarchy" in Somalia, and shares the Brown Card of 06.01.2005.
06.12.2010. NRK-TV2 sends and anglophone program about Somalia falsely
calling it 'anarchy', and thus NRK gets a Brown Card. 

CNN 06.01.2007 reports "The ease with which Somalis can get weapons is a
major problem in this chaotic African nation. It has not had an effective
government since clan-based warlords toppled a military dictatorship in 1991
and plunged the country into anarchy, " - mixing up rivaling polyarchy,
ochlarchy and chaos with anarchy, and thus gets a Brown Card. 16.12.2008:
Brown Card to the authoritarian conservative liberalist propaganda station
CNN for wrongly calling the rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy in Somalia
anarchy! In a commercial for their own program the CNN is daily spreading
myths that they have "a front road seat to anarchy" in Somalia. You are
reporting wrong. Somalia is a failed STATE, i.e. a STATE, not anarchy. It is
a STATE, i.e. archy, with rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy. NOT ANARCHY!!!!
We give you a Brown Card because you are spreading lies that Somalia is an
anarchy. This is authoritarian, Orwellian "1984" newspeak... 04.10.2009.
Christiane Amanpour on CNN declares: "Anarchy has been a constant in
Somalia", and gets a Brown Card for spreading this disinformation. The
IAT-APT repeats: "Somalia is a failed STATE, i.e. a STATE, not anarchy. It
is a STATE, i.e. archy, with rivaling polyarchy and ochlarchy. NOT ANARCHY!
Anarchy and State are opposites." CNN 02.07.2010 again mentions "anarchy" in
connection to Somalia and get another Brown Card. 

Tuesday, November 20, 2007 the New York Times, ID 40041893, reports:
"Somalia's ills have always come in waves, starting in 1991 when clan-based
militias overthrew the central government and the country plunged into
anarchy. That fighting, like the fighting today, disrupted markets, kept out
aid shipments and led to rapid inflation of food prices. As a result,
hundreds of thousands of people starved." This is authoritarian Orwellian
"1984" newspeak from NYTimes. It has never been anarchy in Somalia, just
rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy, etc, a failed state, and thus according to
the Oslo Convention NYTimes gets a Brown Card. 

03.12.2009. Brown Card to Wikipedia. The authoritarian mockery of a free
encyclopedia, Wikipedia, falsely reports about "Anarchy in Somalia"; see
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_in_Somalia&gt;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy_in_Somalia . The International
Anarchist Tribunal - Anarchist Press Tribunal ( IAT-APT) declares: It has
never since 1991 been anarchy in Somalia, just rivaling polyarchy with
ochlarchy and chaos, a failed State. Somalia is a failed STATE, i.e. a
STATE, not anarchy. It is a STATE, i.e. archy, with rivaling polyarchy,
ochlarchy and chaos. NOT ANARCHY! Anarchy and State are opposites. Anarchy
and rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. archy, are opposites. Anarchy
and chaos are opposites, see the Oslo Convention
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html and search
for anarchy vs chaos at  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html . To mix up opposites as 1. Anarchy and
State, 2. Anarchy and rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. archy, and 3.
Anarchy and chaos, as Wikipedia does, is equally authoritarian as mixing up
opposites as peace and war, as Big Brother did in Orwell's "1984" newspeak.
It should be stopped, and the IAT-APT hands out a Brown Card to Wikipedia,
as free, libertarian criticism of this authoritarian tendency. The Anarchist
International and the IAT-APT of course condemn the terrorism and ochlarchy
in general in Somalia. 

06.01.2010. Brown Card to CIA. The CIA (non)fact book falsely reports "After
the regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil,
factional fighting, and anarchy."; see
&lt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/countrytem
plate_so.html&gt;
https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/countrytemp
late_so.html . The International Anarchist Tribunal - Anarchist Press
Tribunal ( IAT-APT) declares: It has never since 1991 been anarchy in
Somalia, just rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy and chaos, a failed State.
Somalia is a failed STATE, i.e. a STATE, not anarchy. It is a STATE, i.e.
archy, with rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy and chaos. NOT ANARCHY! Anarchy
and State are opposites. Anarchy and rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e.
archy/state, are opposites. Anarchy and chaos are opposites, see the Oslo
Convention  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html and search for anarchy vs chaos at
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html .
To mix up opposites as 1. Anarchy and State, 2. Anarchy and rivaling
polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. archy/state, as CIA does, is equally
authoritarian as mixing up opposites as peace and war, as Big Brother did in
Orwell's "1984" newspeak. It should be stopped, and the IAT-APT hands out a
Brown Card to CIA, as free, libertarian criticism of this authoritarian
tendency. The Anarchist International and the IAT-APT of course condemn the
terrorism and ochlarchy in general in Somalia. 

26.11.2009. Mohamed Olad Hassan, Tom Odula and Associated Press declare:
"Somalia has been mired in anarchy and chaos since 1991 when warlords
overthrew longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre." It is true that Somalia has
been mired in chaos, but it has never been anarchy there. Chaos and anarchy
are opposites, see the Oslo Convention  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html and search for anarchy vs chaos at
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html .
To mix up opposites as anarchy and chaos as Mohamed Olad Hassan, Tom Odula
and Associated Press do, is equally authoritarian as mixing up opposites as
peace and war, as Big Brother did in Orwell's "1984" newspeak. It should be
stopped, and the International Anarchist Tribunal - Anarchist Press Tribunal
hands out Brown Cards to Mohamed Olad Hassan, Tom Odula and Associated
Press, as free, libertarian criticism of this authoritarian tendency. 

A similar Brown Card goes to the authoritarian marxist propaganda station
BBC for falsely reporting about "anarchy" in Somalia in their Country
profile: Somalia, updated Friday, 2 May 2008 at
&lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1072592.stm&gt;
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1072592.stm ,
quoting:"Somalia has been without an effective central government since
President Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991. Years of fighting between rival
warlords and an inability to deal with famine and disease have led to the
deaths of up to one million people. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former leader
of the semi-autonomous Somali region of Puntland, was chosen by Somalia's
interim parliament as president of the Transitional Federal Government in
October 2004. The election took place in Kenya because the Somali capital
was regarded as being too dangerous. The president pledged to promote
reconciliation and to set about rebuilding the country. But his government,
plagued by internal disagreements, has failed to end Somalia's anarchy. BBC
also mentions "SURVIVING ANARCHY" at the same web-page. It must be clear to
all that Somalia is a failed state, i.e. a state - and not anarchy. 

10.05.2009 BBC-TV correctly states that "Somalia, a nation of about eight
million people, has experienced almost constant civil conflict since the
collapse of its central government in January 1991." But it is totally wrong
to call this anarchy, as BBC-TV does. Anarchy means a functioning central
administration, but not government, i.e. top heavy pyramid in rank and/or
income, significantly vertically organized. The system with rivaling
polyarchy and ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined) in Somalia is clearly
government, archy, and not anarchy. Thus the authoritarian marxist
propaganda station BBC-TV gets a Brown Card, for spreading this
disinformation, according to the Oslo Convention. 15.08.2012 IAT hands out a
Brown Card to BBC for continuing to lie "Somalia's decades of anarchy" 01.06
and 15.08.2012. The situation in Somalia is and has been rivaling polyarchy
with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - NOT ANARCHY. Somalia is the country most far
from anarchy in the world. 04.06.2013 Robert Fowler on BBC's Hardtalk,
mentions "chaos and anarchy" in Somalia, and the IAT hands out Brown Cards
to Fowler and BBC, according to the Oslo Convention. 

15.09.2009 BBC reports about "anarchy and lawlessness" in Zimbabwe. Anarchy
is optimal order and not lawlessness. It is a very authoritarian ochlarchy
in Zimbabwe, far from anarchy, and the authoritarian marxist propaganda
station BBC-TV gets a Brown Card, for spreading this disinformation,
according to the Oslo Convention. 29.11.2010 BBC-TV continues wrongly to
call Somalia 'anarchy' and the BBC's Website is full of this lie, thus
IAT-APT hands out another Brown Card to BBC, this ultra-authoritarian
marxist propaganda 'news'-station. 

Brown card to CNN and Arwa Damon for falsely calling the rivaling polyarchy
and ochlarchy in Iraq - anarchy. 28.05.2009 and repeated several times CNN
in "World's untold stories - Inside Iraq: Living with the enemy" (by Arwa
Damon) expresses: "Not long ago it seemed that Iraq was on the edge of
complete anarchy. Bodies were been dumped in the streets every day as Sunni
and Shia groups settled scores... Iraqis turned on each other, neighbors
slaughtered neighbors, friends betrayed one another. It was the sheer
degradation of society on a shocking and utterly petrifying scale." It must
be clear for all educated people that this situation in Iraq was not near
complete, 100%, anarchy, or any form of anarchy of lower degree, i.e.
systems with an anarchy degree above 50% and thus an authoritarian degree
less than 50 %. The situation in Iraq was a very authoritarian hell society
with rivaling polyarchy/oligarchy mixed with ochlarchy (mob rule), i.e. with
more than 666 per thousand (67%) authoritarian degree, and thus very far
from anarchy. Polyarchy with ochlarchy is not anarchy. CNN and Arwa Damon
get a Brown Card, for spreading this disinformation, according to the Oslo
Convention. The system by now is a bit less authoritarian, but still far
from anarchy. 

11.04.2009: Robert D. Kaplan, Center for a New American Security, and the
IHT-NY-Times get a Brown Card for breaking the Oslo Convention and falsely
postulating "anarchy on land means piracy at sea", "piracy is the maritime
ripple effect of anarchy on land. Somalia is a failed state and has the
longest coastline in mainland Africa, so piracy flourishes nearby." "Somali
pirates are usually unemployed young men who have grown up in an atmosphere
of anarchic violence, and have been dispatched by a local warlord to bring
back loot for his coffers. It is organized crime carried out by roving
gangs." As Kaplan correctly states Somalia is failed state, i.e. a STATE
with rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined) and chaos,
rivaling states within the state, i.e. a form of archy, but not as he
suggests anarchy, the quite opposite. We repeat: SOMALIA is a STATE, ARCHY -
NOT ANARCHY. Anarchy and State are opposites. There are no pirates at sea
outside Norway and Iceland, i.e. anarchies.  

16-17.01.2010. Brown Card to Luis Carballo and Euronews, that speak about
"total anarchy" in Haiti. Haiti is after the massive earthquake to be
considered as a FAILED STATE. The central administration is no longer
functioning. Haiti is now a failed STATE, i.e. a STATE, not anarchy. It is a
STATE, i.e. archy, with rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy and chaos. NOT
ANARCHY! Anarchy and State are opposites. Anarchy and rivaling polyarchy
with ochlarchy, i.e. archy, are opposites. Anarchy and chaos are opposites,
see the Oslo Convention  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt;
http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html and search for anarchy vs chaos at
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html&gt; http://www.anarchy.no/andebatt.html .
To mix up opposites as 1. Anarchy and State, 2. Anarchy and rivaling
polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. archy, and 3. Anarchy and chaos, as Luis
Carballo and Euronews do, is equally authoritarian as mixing up opposites as
peace and war, as Big Brother did in Orwell's "1984" newspeak. It should be
stopped, and the IAT-APT hands out Brown Cards to Luis Carballo and
Euronews, as free, libertarian criticism of this authoritarian tendency. The
Anarchist International and the IAT-APT of course condemn the chaos and
ochlarchy in Haiti, and call for law and order. It is not anarchy in Haiti,
not total anarchy and not anarchy of lower degree! Jan Espen Kruse and NRK
report "kaotisk ... totalt lovløse tilstander ... anarki," in Haiti, setting
chaos and lawlessness, i.e. ochlarchy, falsely equal to anarchy, and thus
get Brown Cards. 

CNN and Lucia Newman describe the situation in Port-au-Prince, as "anarchy
... anarchy grips Haitian capital", they falsey postulate, mentioning "armed
gangs, thugs, are ransacking, patrolling the streets at will, and there are
no police to be seen." This is however rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy,
and not anarchy, and thus CNN and Lucia Newman get Brown Cards. Later Ivan
Watson on CNN falsely calls the situation in Haiti "anarchic", and he gets a
Brown Card. NY-Times and Mark Lacey report "patience was wearing thin, and
reports of looting increased, ... for the moment, this is anarchy," said
Adolphe Reynald, a top aide to the mayor of Port-au-Prince. "For the
moment", it is not anarchy, but as mentioned rivaling polyarchy with
ochlarchy and chaos, and NY-Times, Mark Lacey and Adolphe Reynald get Brown
Cards. 

In another article in NY-Times the "Big Brothers" Mark Lacey and Simon
Romero report "there were pockets of violence and anarchy, reports of
looting and ransacking, and at least one lynching of an accused looter as
police officers stood aside." As mentioned it is rivaling polyarchy with
ochlarchy and chaos, and a failed state, in Haiti - the quite opposite of
anarchy. The central administration is not functioning in Haiti, and a
functioning central administration - with law and order - is necessary for
anarchy. Thus NY-Times, Mark Lacey and Simon Romero get a fresh Brown Card.
Reuters and Carlos Barria report "It's anarchy there now, total chaos, the
police have gone away," about Haiti, and also they get a Brown Card. The
Anarchist International calls on all anarchists to send money-aid to Haiti,
through safe channels, say Red Cross. 11.09.2010 BBC (TV) in a retrospective
report falsely postulates that Haiti was "on the brink of anarchy", and gets
a Brown Card from IAT-APT according to the Oslo Convention. 

14.11.2004: Euronews is reporting: During a public debate in the city of
Marseille, the French president said Paris would carry on with its UN
peacekeeping mandate, which he says was also backed by other African
nations. In criticism of the regime of Ivorian President Laurant Gbagbo, he
said he would not leave the former colony, which was once a model to others,
to head down a road towards "anarchy and fascism". The French president is
probably mixing up rivaling polyarchy, ochlarchy and chaos with anarchy, and
thus gets a Brown Card. Anarchy and fascism are opposite systems on the
Economical-Political map, and thus anarchy cannot exist together with
fascism at the same time and place. 

CNN writes on its website 01.09.2014: “ANARCHY IN LIBYA”, “U.S. diplomats
evacuated the anarchic Libyan capital last month” and “the anarchy that
currently reigns in Libya's capital”.  This is an Orwellian “1984” newspeak
lie. De facto there is rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos, and
far from anarchy and anarchic, in Libya - included Tripoli. CNN gets a Brown
Card for this serious break of the Oslo-Convention. Libya is at the moment a
failed state, i.e. a State – not anarchy and anarchic. Libya will probably
be a failed state – a rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos, for
many years. 

Brown Cards to Patrick Cockburn and the Independent UK. Rivaling polyarchy
with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - and ultra-fascist, in Syria, Iraq and Libya,
not anarchy. 

19.09.2015 Patrick Cockburn writes in the Independent UK the following:
"Refugee crisis was caused by a careless West that allowed anarchy and fear
to take root in the Middle East. The war in Syria and Iraq has gone on as
long as the First World War... Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991, the Western powers no longer see their vital interests as being
affected by the collapse of countries such as Libya or Iraq. It is
noticeable that anarchy in these two countries has little effect on the
price of oil, though both countries are important producers." 

This is not true. The truth is that Syria, Iraq and Libya are failed states,
with rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - and ultra-fascist, not
anarchy. The International Anarchist Tribunal (IAT) hands out Brown Cards to
Patrick Cockburn and the Independent UK, for this Orwellian newspeak
misusing the word anarchy, and breaking the Oslo Convention.

Brown Cards to Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, Fareed Zakaria
GPS, and CNN. Rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - and
ultra-fascism, in Syria, Iraq and Libya etc., not anarchy.

15.02.2016 Peter Bergen at Fareed Zakaria GPS on CNN is misusing the word
anarchy pointing to some countries in the Middle East, say Syria, Iraq and
Libya etc. It is not true that these States are anarchies. The truth is that
Syria, Iraq and Libya etc. are failed states, with rivaling polyarchy with
ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - and ultra-fascist, not anarchy. The International
Anarchist Tribunal (IAT) hands out Brown Cards to Peter Bergen, CNN's
national security analyst, Fareed Zakaria GPS, and CNN, for this Orwellian
newspeak misusing the word anarchy, and breaking the Oslo Convention. The
only anarchies in the world are Norway, the Swiss Confederation and Iceland.
They are also very good for people to live in. So Bergen is also wrong when
he said "The only thing that is worse than dictatorship is anarchy". Anarchy
is real democracy, not rivaling polyarchy with ochlarchy, i.e. chaos - and
ultra-fascism.

Resolution from


The Anarchist Federation of Norway 


Anarkistføderasjonen i Norge AFIN

http://www.anarchy.no/red_bl.jpg

  


STYRING OG STYRERE KONTRA HERSKING OG HERSKERE
Anarkismen står for sterk styring, og ingen hersking/hersker(e)



Endelsen krati, som i demokrati, betyr styre. Archos betyr hersker på gresk,
og archein er et noe mer tvetydig ord som kan bety lede, herske og komme
først. Når en ser archos og archein  i sammenheng i anarkistisk perspektiv
får man at arki betyr hersker(e), hersking, eller rettere sagt system basert
på herskere og hersking, jevnfør f.eks. monarki som betyr system og styring
basert på en hersker, og polyarki system og styring basert på mange herskere
og anarki betyr system og styring uten hersking og herskere. 

Det er denne tolkningen av anarkibegrepet som er relevant i anarkistisk
sammenheng, med etymologiske røtter i archos + archein, samt an. Anarki
betyr følgelig ikke uten styring, men styring og system uten herskere og
hersking. Vi har anarki , an-ark-i , 'an' (uten) - 'ark'
(hersker(e)/hersking) – 
' i ' (system, styring, som i mon-ark- i, inkludert lov og optimal orden),
og utelukker dermed også at pøbelen hersker, pøbelvelde i vid forstand =
oklarki, slik det er når det er kaos og lovløse tilstander. Anarki er
således ikke kaos og lovløse tilstander, oklarki. 

Koordinering uten hersker(e) kan skje via delegater med mandatering og/eller
direkte demokrati, dvs. styringen, inklusive innflytelse på styringen, går
mer nedenfra, fra folket, og opp i større grad enn ovenifra, fra øvrigheten,
og ned. Folket er her definert som klasse, sett i kontrast til øvrigheten i
privat og offentlig sektor, økonomisk og/eller politisk/administrativt, dvs.
i lønn og/eller rang i vid forstand. Med folket mener vi altså her grasrota.
Anarki er følgelig reelt demokrati, realdemokrati, både økonomisk og
politisk/administrativt, at folkets innflytelse på styringen er reell, &gt;
eller = 50%, noe som igjen innebærer at graden av autonomi i videste
forstand og samtidig graden av sosialisme i videste forstand er &gt; eller =
50%. 

Det er altså ikke mangel på styring under anarkismen, og de som styrer -
styrer seg selv ( i betydelig grad = signifikant ) og ikke over andre (i
betydelig grad = signifikant), dvs. er (vesentlig = signifikant)
selvstyrere, i motsetning til hersking, som betyr styring over andre ( i
betydelig grad = signifikant) og som utføres av herskere. 
 
Anarki er altså styring uten hersking og hersker(e), dvs. ulike former for
selvstyre, signifikant. Styring er koordinering av arbeidsoppgaver for å nå
et mål. 

Anarkister er således ikke mot å ha en ordstyrer eller en dirigent for et
orkester etc., så lenge det ikke dreier seg om hersking og herskere, men om
koordinering uten undertrykkelse. Anarkister har snakket om at det bør være
flere hender på "rattet" når det gjelder økonomisk og politisk/administrativ
styring av samfunnet. Dette er imidlertid en pedagogisk metafor, og skal
tolkes billedlig, og selvfølgelig ikke tas bokstavelig som at flere skal
holde i rattet når en skal styre en bil, eller at det skal være flere med
hender på roret når det gjelder styringen av en båt. En taxisjåfør skal
således selvfølgelig ha rattet alene, men passasjerene skal bestemme hvor en
skal, og sjåføren styre dit på kortest og billigst mulig måte, og være
"folkets tjener". Da er det anarki. 

Om det omvendte skjer, dvs. at sjåføren kjører bevisst en omvei for å sko
seg, eller er frekk m.v., opptrer sjåføren som hersker og ikke folkets
tjener og delegert styrer. I dette tilfellet er det ikke anarki, men
autoritært. Tilsvarende gjelder for buss, fly, tog og båt, m.v. Så lenge det
ikke dreier seg om hersking og herskere, men om koordinering uten
undertrykkelse, kan det også a) være greit med en kaptein og offiserer, men
en skal b) ikke ha mer av slikt enn det som er strengt tatt nødvendig og
optimalt - dvs. er effektivt og rettferdig, og det må være med små lønns- og
rangsforskjeller, - signifikant horisontalt organisert. Og dette kan altså
ikke overføres til styring av samfunnet, økonomisk og
politisk/administrativt. Samfunnet er politisk/administrativt og økonomisk
ikke å ligne med en båt, bil, tog eller fly. Ting kan gå galt om samfunnet -
organisasjonen - er stor, og da er kaptein/skipsmodellen ubrukbar for reelt
demokrati, dvs. anarki. Den er forbehold transport. Den fascistiske parolen:
"Et folk - en fører! Ellers er vi ute og kjører!" holder således ikke mål.
Anarkistisk styring er generelt basert på "freedom within a framework",
frihet innenfor en ramme. 

Apropos "kaptein og offiserer", i forsvaret og lignende kan det også være
aktuelt med admiraler og generaler og én på toppen, spesielt i krigstid, men
også forsvaret må være betydelig horisontalt organisert, effektivt og med
små lønns- og rangsforskjeller, for å være anarkistisk. Det må generelt ikke
være en topptung pyramide i lønn og/eller rang, byråkratisk og ineffektivt
og med kadaverdisiplin, og med oklarki (pøbelherrevelde i vid forstand),
forsvaret må være med an-oklarki, dvs. uten oklarki, eller mer presist ha et
system og styring uten pøbelherrevelde - uten mobbing og uten at pøbel og
mobbere hersker, for å være libertært, frihetlig og anarkistisk. Også i
forsvaret og politiet skal det generelt være "freedom within a framework",
frihet innenfor en ramme. Rammene er i prinsippet bestemt av folket,
demokratisk, også via delegering. Forsvaret og politiet står ansvarlige
overfor folket. 

Er man f.eks. fagsjef eller faglig leder i et nettverk av selvstendige, kan
det meget vel dreie seg om koordinering uten undertrykkelse, og ikke noe
autoritært. Det er da som regel ordinær, dvs. signifikant og betydelig,
horisontal organisasjon - ikke 100% flatt. Anarki, opplyst (enlightened)
anarki, og det må anarki være i betydelig grad (signifikant), er mestrernes
samfunn, der folk flest får utnyttet sine evner rimelig bra, og mestrer sitt
arbeid og sin øvrige virksomhet i rimelig høy grad. 

I en kommentar til den nye Maktutredningen i Aftenposten medio 2001 hevdet
Harald Stanghelle bl.a.: "autoritet" er et ord på vei ut av
samfunnshverdagen og inn i fremmedordbøkene. Det ville i så fall kanskje
være det beste.... Uansett: Anarkismen står for sterk styring, sterk
koordinering, og ingen hersking/hersker(e). 

Horisontal organisasjon, en nedenfra og opp tilnærming i motsetning til en
ovenfra og ned tilnærming, økonomisk og politisk /administrativt, betyr
organisasjon uten hersker(e), dvs. ikke topptung pyramide, men ikke uten
styring og øvrighet. Det er 1. organisasjon med signifikant små inntekts- og
rangs- forskjeller, 2. myndige arbeidere med betydelig innflytelse og frihet
innenfor et rammeverk, og 3. reell demokratisk kontroll på den ene eller den
andre måten. Det er ikke et system hvor øvrigheten tar ordrer fra
arbeiderne, utenom tilfellet med 100% flat organisasjon. En horisontal
organisasjon har en grad av flathet, en anarkigrad, mellom 50 % og 100 %,
det anarkistiske ideal. Med arbeidere menes frontlinjen,
førstelinjetjenesten, i en organisasjon. 

Norge er i dag et anarki av lav grad, estimert til ca. 54 % anarkigrad,
«anarchist light». Det er 100 % -  ca. 54 % = ca. 46 % autoritærgrad, dvs.
ganske sterke autoritære tendenser å slite med, bl.a. en del oklarki.
Anarkigraden kan med fordel økes. Mer anarki er bare bra.

The solution to the world economic crisis is Cogrips-policy. 
For free international trade, i.e. based on free contracts - not slave
contracts - as the TTIP. Direct actions against the TTIP and for
Cogrips-policy.

  _____  

We are for free international trade, i.e. based on free contracts - not
slave contracts - as the TTIP and similar

We, the anarchists - real libertarians - are for free international trade,
i.e. based on free contracts - not slave contracts - as the TTIP and
similar. We call for direct actions against the TTIP and similar, of course
without ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined). The best solution to achieve
full employment is Cogrips-policy based on Cogrips-models. We call for
Cogrips-policy world wide. Source: WEC 06.10.2016.

World economic forecasts for 2016 and a scenario for full employment. Demand
increase must be doubled to achieve full employment.

Full employment is achieved when (1) the total demand = (the labor
force*productivity*pricelevel). The solution to the crisis is proper demand
management, i.e. the condition (1) fulfilled. This mainly means increased
demand by the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people via increased
purchasing power for ordinary men and women, managed by the central
administration. This is Cogrips-policy. (The Keynesian policy with increased
public consumption will not work, mainly because of crowding out.) With
severe economic crisis this (Cogrips-policy) includes large funds financed
by quantitative easing to finance the necessary increased demand by the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people. All libertarians should join in
this call for proper demand management, Cogrips-policy, i.e. (1) - NOW!
Increased demand is the key factor for solving the economic crisis.
Demand/(pricelevel*productivity) = employment. The world economic forecasts
for 2016 are: increase in labor productivity 2 percent, increase in labor
force 1 percent, increase in total demand nominally 7 percent, inflation,
increase in price level, 4 percent, unemployment 6 percent. Full employment
cet. par. is achieved if nominal demand is increased from 7 percent to 14
percent. Total demand for the world is public and private investment plus
public and private consumption. Percentage increases from 2015 to 2016.

AGAINST ECONOMIC CRISIS... 

ABOUT THE WEC 

The World Economic Council - WEC - was founded 01.05.2009 in Oslo. The
practical administration of WEC is taken care of by the IIFOR staff and the
secretariate of the Libertarian* International, mainly located in Oslo,
Norway. The postal address is WEC P.O.B. 4777 Sofienberg N- 0506 Oslo -
Norway. The purpose of WEC is to make advice to international media,
mandated persons and people in general to a) solve economic crisis problems
and b) achieve environmentally sustainable economic growth with full
employment world wide, and c) support libertarian actions and dialog to
achieve a) and b). The basis is the practical and theoretical framework
presented at the links above, especially the General Theory of Economics,
i.e. libertarian economics. The Web-page of WEC presents updated material
related to a), b) and c), the newest on top. 

Cogrips-models and Cogrips-policy, rooted back to economical Nobel Prize
winner and social-individualist anarchist Ragnar Frisch, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt; The unenlightened plutarchy with links,
are an important part of the basis for WEC's analysis, advice and other
actions. These models and policy are an efficient alternative to
Keynes-models and the increasingly inefficient Keynesian economic policy of
our time -- regarding optimal demand management broadly defined, against
economic crisis and in general. The Keynes-paradigm is falling... Long live
Cogrips-models and Cogrips policy! 

An economic-political system with significant unemployment is in general
neither efficient, i.e. Pareto-optimal, nor fair, as defined by
libertarians. Libertarian political economy includes efficient and fair
solutions, with a.o.t. full employment and green/environmental issues fully
taken into account. Theoretically, as a special case, the unenlightened
plutarchy can have about full employment, but not in general and also
looking at history and the longer run this case can be practically ruled
out.

The libertarians and WEC are against, and do and support
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; direct actions against top heavy
societal pyramids, economical and/or political/administrative -- cut
bureaucracy costs -- increase the demand of the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people -- the people seen as a class as
opposed to the superiors in rank and/or income -- for full employment --
against the unenlightend plutarchy of several systems, IMF, WB, euro and US
$. Troubled economies in Europe should leave the euro and the Euro-zone,
this will make proper demand management more easy. 

In general it must pay to work, for the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt;
people. More information about the fight against the unenlightened plutarchy
- and for full employment, see especially
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ija132.html&gt; No to euro - Full employment - Anarchist

World economic forecasts for 2016 and a scenario for full employment. Demand
increase must be doubled to achieve full employment.

Full employment is achieved when (1) the total demand = (the labor
force*productivity*pricelevel). The solution to the crisis is proper demand
management, i.e. the condition (1) fulfilled. This mainly means increased
demand by the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people via increased
purchasing power for ordinary men and women, managed by the central
administration. This is Cogrips-policy. (The Keynesian policy with increased
public consumption will not work, mainly because of crowding out.) With
severe economic crisis this (Cogrips-policy) includes large funds financed
by quantitative easing to finance the necessary increased demand by the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/klasse.html&gt; people. All libertarians should join in
this call for proper demand management, Cogrips-policy, i.e. (1) - NOW!
Increased demand is the key factor for solving the economic crisis.
Demand/(pricelevel*productivity) = employment. The world economic forecasts
for 2016 are: increase in labor productivity 2 percent, increase in labor
force 1 percent, increase in total demand nominally 7 percent, inflation,
increase in price level, 4 percent, unemployment 6 percent. Full employment
cet. par. is achieved if nominal demand is increased from 7 percent to 14
percent. Total demand for the world is public and private investment plus
public and private consumption. Percentage increases from 2015 to 2016.

At new year 2015 the crisis is far from over. In the USA the official
unemployment rate U3 is down to 5-6 percent, but the more realistic U6 is
still above 10 percent. In the Eurozone the official unemployment rate is
still above 10 percent. Thus, there is still economic depression in USA as
well as the Eurozone. Thus the need for efficient demand management broadly
defined is still very much on, i.e. Cogrips-policy. Source: WEC 19.01.2015.

May Day 2012 Manifesto by IWW

The fight against the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt; unenlightened
plutarchy and  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt; statism including
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; ochlarchy, and for
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; anarchy i.e.
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/realdemocracy.html&gt; real democracy, continues
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; world wide. It is more than five years since
the financial crisis hit, followed rapidly by a larger economic crisis. The
resulting shock added millions to the already teeming ranks of the jobless
and threw millions more into precarious work. Many workers have lost good
jobs and far too many have also lost the fundamental rights that went with
them. 

There is only one cause of the crisis: lack of proper demand management.
Proper demand management is more easy done in anarchy than archy, look to
Norway, but anarchy is not necessary for proper demand management. The main
player in demand management is the central administration be it anarchist or
archist. The most efficient demand management is Cogrips-policy, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/wec.html&gt; the WEC resolutions. We call for
Cogrips-policy world wide for proper demand management and the end of the
economic crisis. Source: International Workers of the World 28.04.2012.

Most of the OECD countries are ruled by the unenlightened plutarchy with
economic depression. Keynes is out. Probably only Cogrips-models and -policy
can create full employment in 2011-12-13! New York Times 07.01.2011 stated
that "Slow job growth dims expectation of early revival" in USA, continuing
"The year 2010 ended on a disappointing note, as the economy added just
103,000 jobs in December, suggesting that economic deliverance will not
arrive with a great pop in employment. Signs still point to a long slog of a
recovery, with the unemployment rate likely to remain above 8 percent —  it
sits at 9.4 percent after Friday's report — at least through the rest of the
president's four-year term... The unemployment rate, which is based on a
separate survey of households, fell from 9.8 percent in November, though a
substantial part of that drop is caused by Americans leaving the work
force." See

ysheadlines&amp;emc=tha2&gt; NY-Times - Jobs?. 

WEC's unenlightened plutarchy scenario with forecasts for a.o.t.
unemployment in 2010, see below, became approximately a reality in several
of the OECD countries, say, in the Euro-zone at large, and in the USA. The
official registered unemployment rates (based on surveys with statistical
errors), were about 10% but would have been higher if discouraged people had
not left the workforce. The real unemployment rates may thus be much higher
than about 10 percent, perhaps about 12.5 percent in several OECD countries,
as indicated by WEC. The OECD unemployment statistics mainly confirm this
analysis of WEC and IIFOR, see
&lt;http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=MEILABOUR&gt; OECD - Labour and
unemployment statistics. The Anarchy of Norway had the lowest unemployment
rate in Europe in 2010, mainly due to an economic policy compatible with
Cogrips-models and Cogrips-policy. 

As mentioned, probably only Cogrips-models and -policy can create full
employment in 2011-12-13, see the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt;
Basic ideas of Ragnar Frisch with links. Economic Nobel Prize winner Ragnar
Frisch made the first attempts to create Cogrips-models and -policy, and
todays' Cogrips-models and -policy are inspired by these works by Frisch.
Cogrips-models and -policy are mainly compatible with libertarian economics,
as opposed to bureaucracy economics, see, say,

The real unemployment rate may be 40% higher than the official registered
unemployment rate 
in 2011 and the difference may be increasing

The OECD, UN and national statistics first and foremost present the official
registered unemployment rates. These numbers are per 2011 depressingly
large, more than 5 percent -- indicating economic depression, in most
OECD-countries. However especially in times of economic crisis, these
figures most likely severely under-counts the true number of unemployed. For
instance, the official registered unemployment rate doesn't count 1. those
people who don't have a job and have given up looking for one, or 2. those
who have found marginal part-time work but still can't make ends meet and
are still looking for more work or a full-time job. Some countries present
alternative measures of labor underutilization, such as USA. In the US these
concepts include: 

1.1. Persons marginally attached to the labor force, i.e. those who
currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they
want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the
past 12 months. Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached,
have given a job-market related reason for not currently looking for work. 

1.2. NB! However people that indicate that they want and are available for a
job and not have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months, are not
accounted for in the US statistics. This may be a significant number, since
the crisis started in 2008, and this figure will most likely increase over
time as long as the crisis lasts. IIFOR and WEC call those the long time
discouraged workers. 

1.3. Per definition the real unemployment ratio = [(real labor force - real
employment)/real labor force]100%. A crude estimate of the size of the real
labor force is based on same percentage of the population between 16-67
years as the registered labor force in percent of the population between
16-67 years in good economic times, say, the average for 1998-2000. The real
unemployment rate includes both the marginally attached and the long time
discouraged workers. 

1.4. In USA the official unemployment rate was 8.8 percent in March 2011.
Adding the marginally attached unemployed the rate was 10.3 percent, see
&lt;http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm&gt; US Bureau of Labor
Statistics - Table A-15. However including the long time discouraged
workers, the real unemployment rate may be, say, 12-13 percent for USA in
March 2011, perhaps even more. This is a quite conservative estimate related
to 1.3.. Thus the real unemployment rate in USA may very well be about 40
percent higher than the official registered unemployment rate in 2011, and
may be increasing toward 60 percent higher in the next years. The percentage
difference between the real unemployment rate and the official registered
unemployment rate may perhaps be about the same in other OECD-countries,
however this is mainly a question of further research, a.o.t. based on 1.3..


2. Persons employed part time for economic reasons, i.e. those who want and
are available for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time
schedule. This is more a question of underemployment than unemployment.
However adding those, but not  the long time discouraged workers, the
underemployment rate was 15.7 percent in USA for March 2011. Adding the long
time discouraged workers, the underemployment rate may be 17.5-18.5 per cent
in USA for March 2011. Source: WEC 08.04.2011. 

Apropos G-20 Seoul: world export = import; correcting imbalances in 
trade will not solve the depression problem, a big hike in world total
demand will

The 2010 G-20 Seoul Summit was the fifth meeting of the G-20 heads of
government, to discuss the global financial system and the world economy. It
took place in Seoul, South Korea on November 11–12, 2010. The headline issue
was currency war and addressing trade imbalances. Leaders were generally
unable to agree on key issues, with commentators noting the absence of the
sense of unity that had been present at summits during the worse of the
global financial crisis of 2007-2009. IMF managing director Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said this particular summit was "more of a G20 debate than a
G20 conclusion". More agreement on correcting trade balances would however
not contributed significantly to solve the crisis: World export = import;
correcting imbalances in trade will not solve the depression problem, a
sufficient hike in world total demand will. Exporting the crisis will not
solve the problem, only distribute the unemployment around the world.
Source: WEC. 20.11.2010. 

The solution: Quantitative easing for the people - not the bureaucracy!

The USA (and also the Euro-countries seen all in all) is in deep economic
depression with around 10 percent unemployment-ratio. The Federal Reserve in
USA, the central bank, is in the autumn 2010 doing quantitative easing, i.e.
creating fresh money, for the bureaucracy in the USA. The Fed is not
directing the fresh money directly to the people, seen as a class as opposed
to the superiors in rank and/or income [i.e. the bureaucracy broadly
defined], and thus creating optimal increased demand by the people. The
Fed's monetary policy type quantitative easing is thus bureaucracy
economics, not anarchist economics. 

The fresh money from the Fed will probably a) partly fall into the well
known "liquidity trap", b) partly create increased profitmargin to the
bureaucracy, and inflation, especially later on (and thus be a "hidden
tax"), c) partly be spent on too high, disoptimal, public consumption, may
be with "crowding out" effects, etc. and thus not create an optimal increase
in the demand from and for the people. 

The quantitative easing shold not be combined with traditional Keynesian
monetary policy, but should be combined with libertarian fiscal and
financial policy. Say, give a lump sum gift directly to the people, or cut
taxes for the people, and similar. That will be consistent with anarchist
economics. Stop the Fed's monetary policy type bureaucracy economics
quantitative easing, it will not work optimal. Instead, in short:
Quantitative easing for the people - not the bureaucracy! Sources: WEC and
AIIS. 30.10.2010. 

The unenlightened plutarchy scenario is becoming a reality in the USA -
Unfortunately Obama and USA don't follow the advice from the WEC and must
face the music

Gloomy picture for the people in the USA. More Americans fell into
foreclosure in July as a sour job market kept them from making payments, and
banks took over homes at a near record pace. Registered unemployment held at
9.5 percent in July but would have been higher if discouraged people had not
left the workforce. The real unemploymentrate may thus be much higher than
9.5 percent. Pessimism over the economy is rising and the grim mood could
hurt both parties in the November 2 congressional elections, according to an
NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday 11.08.2010. Almost
two-thirds of Americans believe the economy will worsen before it gets
better, up from 53 percent who felt that way in January, the poll found. 

Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed said the country is headed in the wrong
direction, a percentage that has held steady in NBC/WSJ polling throughout
the year. More than half of respondents said they disapprove of the way
President Barack Obama is handling the economy. The poll also found
Americans were split on Obama's overall job performance, with 48 percent
saying they disapprove and 47 saying they approve. Unfortunately Obama and
USA don't follow the advice from the WEC and must face the music. Sources:

G20 Finance Ministers risk tipping the global economy into a 'double-dip'
depression

WEC and the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/iwwai.html&gt; International Workers of the
World have attacked the outcome of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central
Bank Governors meeting in Busan, Korea, on 5 June. The G20 Finance Ministers
said they were meeting at a 'critical juncture' to secure global recovery
and address economic challenges and risks. They have failed on both counts.
Their decisions risk undermining recovery, whilst they have failed to move
forward the agenda for re-regulating financial markets.  

The message on the economic recovery represents a shift from the Finance
Ministers' April meeting where they cautioned against premature withdrawal
of stimulus measures. In Busan, the focus was on the importance of
"sustainable public finances" and the need for many countries to "accelerate
the pace of consolidation". The Finance Ministers' conclusions do not add
up. Forecasts suggest that the global economy is still on life-support from
public sector stimulus, yet the responsible of the public sectors are now
calling for a shift from supporting jobs to cutting deficits that could push
the global economy into a 'double-dip' depression. 

On financial reform, the Busan meeting failed to decide on what to do next.
The Ministers could not even agree on principles for international taxation
of banks and other financial institutions as called for by the IMF, much
less the adoption of a financial transactions tax (FTT). Nor did they find
minimum common ground for strengthening the Basel II Framework regulating
bank loans. 

The Busan meeting constitutes a setback for the G20. In the meantime, it is
working families who again and again are paying, and will continue to pay,
for the consequences of greed and irresponsible risk-taking by bankers and
financial speculators. The need for further action on jobs and re-regulating
finance is the message the global labor movement will take to the G20
Leaders meeting in Toronto at the end of the month. The unenlightened
plutarchy prevails. Sources: WEC, IWW and AIIS. 07.06.2010.

PS. 18.06.2010. Obama warns G20 leaders on budget cuts, BBC reports. Barack
Obama has warned against cutting national debts too quickly as it would put
economic recovery at risk. In a letter to G20 leaders, the US president said
that while it was important to put in place "credible plans" to cut
deficits, withdrawing economic stimulus early was dangerous. The leaders of
the world's 20 leading economies are due to meet in Toronto on 26 June. Mr
Obama said the priority of the meeting should be "to safeguard and
strengthen the recovery". "Better late than never, Obama", the WEC comments.


PPS. 27.06.2010. WEC supports the resolution "IWW protest against Toronto
G20: The policy of a) the uninformed of real economics and b) bureaucracy
economics", by the (click on:)  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/iwwai.html&gt;
International Workers of the World, etc. BBC 28.07.2010. reports: "G20
summit agrees on deficit cuts by 2013. Leaders at the G20 summit in Canada
have agreed to cut national budget deficits while endeavouring to promote
economic growth. Correspondents note that every major G20 country had
already committed to halve deficits within three years. Host Stephen Harper,
the Canadian prime minister, said that despite these cuts, short-term
economic stimulus measures would still be needed. Proposals for a global
levy on banks have been dropped, Mr Harper said. Instead, that will be left
to individual countries." The WEC declares that 1. with the policy of the
G20 Toronto meeting, and 2. not proper demand management toward full
employment as job no 1., 3. a double dip or continued economic depression is
very likely. 

PPPS. 28.06.2010. Later BBC has updated their report, Harper is now quoted
the following way: "Host Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister said
short-term stimulus measures would be needed to get economies moving... The
head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said
focussing on budget deficits was oversimplifying the problem, because the
situation differed from one country to another." A small improvement, the
WEC comments, and also presents the most economic part, point 4, of the
resolution "IWW protest against Toronto G20: The policy of a) the uninformed
of real economics and b) bureaucracy economics" here:

this is the same as doing away with surplus, and is the policy of a) the
uninformed of real economics and b) bureaucracy economics. It is typical
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt; unenlightened plutarchy. This is
counterproductive, especially when the world economy very likely is entering
a double dip depression, and with about 10% unemployment in many countries,
including USA and the Euro-zone. Economic depression is per definition equal
to or more than 5% unemployment ratio. This is certainly not the right time
for reducing surplus = deficits, but time for proper demand management.
Mandated persons! Do it now! Especially, weakening the over-evaluated US $,
the British £ and the Euro, i.e. the currencies of the main "deficit
countries", is a good thing in the present situation, not the opposite."

WEC: Trillion-dollar euro rescue won't solve the low growth and depression
problem, but it is a small step in the right direction 

A $1 trillion rescue for the euro has halted market panic in its tracks for
now - but may not be enough to save the shared currency in the end. Swedish
Finance Minister Anders Borg said in advance it was vital to reach a deal.
"We now see… wolf-pack behaviors [on markets] and if we will not stop these
packs, even if it is self-inflicted weakness, they will tear the weaker
countries apart." After weeks of dithering, the European Union finally put
serious money on the table to prevent its government debt crisis from
mushrooming - and sinking the euro, stocks and the global recovery. 

But the EU still needs to find ways to keep its member governments from
spending their way to bankruptcy - and disastrously handing the others the
bill, as Greece did to start the crisis. And ultimately it needs to get its
sluggish economy going if it wants to end the threat to its cherished
currency union. After frantic talks lasting into the early hours of Monday,
European officials agreed the 16 countries that use the euro would put up
some euro440 billion in loans, with the EU adding euro60 billion and the
International Monetary Fund some euro250 billion. The European Commission
would raise the money in capital markets, using guarantees from member
goverments, and lend it to crisis stricken countries so they can pay their
bills. Many questions were not answered, such as how the money would be
dispensed and on what terms. WEC declares: The trillion-dollar euro rescue
won't solve the low growth and depression problem, but it is a small step in
the right direction. Sources: WEC and AP. 10.05.2010.

From recession to depression - Depression is per definition equal to or more
than 5% unemployment ratio

Recession is a period of general economic decline; typically defined as a
decline in GDP for two or more consecutive quarters. A recession is
typically accompanied by an increase in unemployment. A recession is
generally considered less severe than a depression, and if a recession
continues long enough it is often then classified as a depression. More
precise the economy is in depression if the unemployment ratio, the number
of unemployed measured in  percent of the labor force, is equal to or more
than 5 percent. Greece, Spain, and the Euro-zone countries seen all in all,
and the USA, are at the moment in economic depression. NB! An economy may be
in depression even if it is going out of recession. Depression is typically
a function of unenlightened plutarchy. 

In the name of the social-individualist anarchist and Nobel economic prize
winner Ragnar Frisch: Think real economics - not fiction/money
quasieconomics. Frisch introduced the term "unenlightened plutarchy", and
was warning about the mismanagement of the unenlightened plutarchy, see

No to the precept: 'socialize the losses and privatize profits'

We, the people, should not pay the economical plutarchists' crisis! The WEC
is clearly against state intervention to save private capitalist interests
following the precept: "socialize the losses and privatize profits." The
policy putting billions of public money, our - the people's -  money, to
save banks and shareholders, while it is "impossible" to find the lowest
peel to meet social needs, must stop. Let the relatively rich, the greedy
economical plutarchists, pay for the crisis. Sources: WEC and AIIS.

What must be done to achieve 3.3% unemployment: Create large funds in USA
and the Euro-zone, financed by quantitative easing, and use them to cut 
taxes and increase social welfare benefits for the people, and increase
demand 14% nominally from 2009 to 2010

What must be done to achieve 3.3% unemployment: Create large funds in USA
and the Euro-zone, financed by quantitative easing, and use them to cut
taxes and increase social welfare benefits for the people - not the
bureaucracy - and increase demand 14% nominally from 2009 to 2010. This
increased supply of money and total demand nominally will probably not
increase inflation significantly in the present situation, assuming that the
"(un-)natural unemployment ratio" is about 3,3% in USA and the Euro-zone.

PS. 23.02.2010. A wave of strikes and demonstrations directed against the
unenlightened plutarchy are - and will be - happening all over Europe and
other parts of the world. These strikes and demonstrations, i.e. direct

WEC warns against growth in the bureaucracy - the countercyclical policy to
achieve the 3.3% unemployment scenario should benefit the people

As mentioned, the WEC supports the people, seen as a class as opposed to the
superiors in rank and/or income, i.e. the bureaucracy. The much more
countercyclical fiscal and monetary measures that must be set in action to
achieve the 3.3% unemployment scenario for 2010 in USA and the Euro-zone,
including Greece, also by more quantitative easing, must not result in
growth in the bureaucracy. Especially not growth in the public bureaucracy,
and much public consumption. How this should be done, see a) "Anarchist vs
bureaucracy economics" and more at  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ija132.html&gt; IJA
1 (32) , and b) anarchist economics in general, see the links at the top of
this Web-page. Source: WEC. 14.02.2010. 

WEC warns about the unenlightened plutarchy scenario - Only 3% growth in
total demand nominally from 2009 to 2010
implies probably about 12.5% unemployment in USA, the Euro-zone and Greece
in 2010 

The updated data for growth in total demand and GDP for USA, the Euro-zone
countries and Greece, indicate only marginal or no growth, and the
unemployment is about 10%. What will happen if this trend continues in 2010?

As mentioned, the WEC supports the people, seen as a class as opposed to the
superiors in rank and/or income, and says: Production is real income, not
money in the bank - you can't eat money, the things with real economical
value are produced goods and services and natural resources. GDP is real
income. In the name of the social-individualist anarchist and Nobel economic
prize winner Ragnar Frisch: Think real economics - not fiction/money
quasieconomics. Frisch introduced the term "unenlightened plutarchy", and
was warning about the mismanagement of the unenlightened plutarchy, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/frisch1.html&gt; basic ideas of Frisch , and this is
just the trend that seems to be happening. This also implies a double dip,
or continuing and worsening dip.

If the USA, the Euro-zone countries and Greece a) are not following the
anarchist economic plan lined out in the chapter "What must be done in USA?
A 3.3% unemployment scenario for 2010" - also valid for the Euro-zone
countries including Greece, but b) let the unenlightened plutarchy rule and
present trend continue, c) the following will probably happen: Only about 3%
increase in total demand nominally, and the same growth in GDP nominally,
from 2009 to 2010. 

A likely unenlightened plutarchy scenario is the following. 10% unemployment
in 2009 and probably 2% increase in the labor force from 2009 to 2010, 2%
inflation and 2% increase in average labor productivity - 3% increase in
total demand nominally from 2009 to 2010, i.e. a 0,98% increase in GDP
volume - real terms. This will result in exactly 12.65% unemployment in
2010, i.e. about 12.5%. This is not acceptable! 

This scenarioanalysis is very likely if not much more countercyclical fiscal
and monetary measures are introduced. Thus, very much more countercyclical
fiscal and monetary measures must be set in action. Let the billions roll!
Do it now Obama, EU's Euro-zone and Greece! It is important for the world
economy to get USA and the Euro-zone including Greece, on the optimal
economical track. Don't be afraid of quantitative easing in the present
situation! Source: WEC. 13.02.2010

Unemployment in the Euro-zone and Greece hit 10%. Thus WEC's US scenario for
2010 is also relevant in this case

Unemployment in the 16 countries that use the euro hit 10% in December for
the first time since the single currency was introduced in 1999, according
to Eurostat, the statistical office for the EU. Some 15.8 million people are
now out of work in the eurozone. Spain continues to have the highest
unemployment rate in the eurozone. The rate rose to 19.5% in December.
Greece's unemployment rate increased to 10.6% in November 2009, according to
the country's national statistics service, NSS. The rate rose from 9.8% in
October, and is also up from the jobless rate of 7.8% recorded a year
earlier. There are now nearly 532,000 unemployed people in the country. The
November numbers are the most up-to-date unemployment figures for Greece.
December 2009 jobless rates are available for most of the other countries in
the EU. Sources: BBC &amp; WEC. 11.02.2010.

What must be done in USA? A 3.3% unemployment scenario for 2010 

The WEC supports the people, seen as a class as opposed to the superiors in
rank and/or income, and says: Production is real income, not money in the
bank - you can't eat money, the things with real economical value are
produced goods and services and natural resources. GDP is real income. In
the name of the social-individualist anarchist and Nobel economic prize
winner Ragnar Frisch: Think real economics - not fiction/money
quasieconomics. 

The USA should follow this anarchist economical plan, or it will not get the
problems solved! - The sooner the better! The public administration should
do proper anarchist economic demand management. USA with 10% unemployment in
2009 and probably 2% increase in the labor force from 2009 to 2010, 2%
inflation and 2% increase in average labor productivity - and accounting for
more countercyclical fiscal and monetary measures - 14% increase in total
demand nominally from 2009 to 2010, i.e. a 11.8% increase in GDP volume -
real terms, will get exactly 3.32% unemployment in 2010. This is a realistic
aim, if the economy is managed properly.

This scenarioanalysis indicates that the countercyclical fiscal and monetary
measures are too small to achieve 3-4% unemployment in 2010, not to mention
full employment. Thus, much more countercyclical fiscal and monetary
measures must be set in action. Let the billions roll! Do it now Obama! It
is important for the world economy to get USA on the optimal economical
track.

WEC warns about a possible 'double-dip' recession 

The WEC has warned that the global economy could experience another downturn
- a so-called double dip recession. WEC said countries should not exit from
countercyclical fiscal and monetary policy measures that have bolstered
growth through huge amounts of stimulus packages and public sector spending.
WEC says we have to be very cautious because this recovery remains very
fragile. China and Asian economies are leading the recovery. Recovery in
advanced economies has been sluggish. Indicators as private demand and
employment are low. In most countries, growth is still supported by central
administration policies. 

For as long as you do not have private demand strong enough to offset the
need of countercyclical fiscal and monetary policy measures, you shouldn't
exit, WEC says. WEC adds that tackling high levels of public sector debt
will be a priority for many countries. Many countries upgrade their
estimates for economic growth, but it is so far not enough to do away with
the high unemployment world wide.

What is GDP? 

GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is arguably the most important of all
economic statistics as it attempts to capture the state of the economy in
one number. GDP represents the value of goods and services produced in the
country from all sections of the economy; agriculture, manufacturing,
energy, construction, the private service sector and public sector. GDP can
be measured in three ways: 

• The value of the goods and services produced; which is known as the output
measure 

• The value of the goods and services purchased by households, by public
sector, from overseas (export - import) and by business in terms of
investment in machinery and buildings. This is the expenditure measure, and
measures total demand for GDP.   

• The value of the income generated mostly in terms of profits and wages;
which is known as the income measure. 

In theory all three approaches should produce the same number. In most
countries the office for national statistics publishes one single measure of
GDP, based on a best estimate using all three ways of measuring. Usually the
main interest in the GDP figures is in the quarterly [or yearly] change in
GDP in real terms - volume, that is after taking account of changes in
prices (inflation). 

The price level of GDP is measured by the GDP deflator, i.e. price index for
GDP. GDP-nominally/GDP-deflator = GDP in real terms - volume. Say, if GDP
increases 5% (= 1. 05), and the inflation is 3%, the price level increases
3% (= 1.03), from the previous period; the GDP volume, i.e. in real terms,
has increased 1.05/1.03 =  1.0194, about 1.9 %. Thus the real economic
growth is 1.9%. 

If the GDP measured in real terms is up on the previous three months, the
economy is growing. If it is negative it is contracting. And two consecutive
three-month periods of contraction mean an economy conventionally is said to
be in recession. If the price level is decreasing, i.e. the inflation is
negative, it is called deflation. Calculating a GDP estimate for all three
measures is a huge undertaking. The output measure alone - which is
considered the most accurate in the short term - involves often surveying
tens of thousands private firms and public sector. 

Usually first an early or "flash", estimate of the real growth in economic
activity is published, but this is revised as more information is gathered.
Revisions can be made as much as 18 months to two years after the first
"flash" estimate. GDP is the principal means of determining the health of
the economy and is used widely, nationally and internationally. GDP is used
internationally by the various financial bodies such as OECD, IMF, and the
World Bank to compare the performance of different economies. The European
Union also uses GDP estimates as a basis for determining different
countries' contributions to the EU budget. 

GDP per capita, the average real income per inhabitant of a country, is also
an important measure. This measure is also one among other measures in
estimation of the libertarian degree of a country, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ranking.html&gt; Ranking .

Euro-zone lending down 

Despite the fact that the European Central Bank is lending billions of euros
to commercial banks it seems that money is not getting into the real
economy. The latest figures show the Euro-zone money supply posted a
surprise drop in November. Banks continue to be reluctant to make loans to
individuals and companies. The amount of money loaned was down for the third
month running in November. (30.12.2009. Euronews)

Quarter of people say capitalism fatally flawed 

Nearly a quarter of people across 27 countries worldwide believe free market
capitalism is fatally flawed, according to a poll published on to mark 20
years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The fall of the Wall, which
separated communist East Germany from capitalist West Germany for nearly 30
years, was seen as a pivotal moment in the collapse of the communist bloc
and a triumph for the free market system. The survey, carried out by
GlobeScan for the BBC World Service, found an average of just 11 percent of
the more than 29,000 people surveyed between June 19 and October 13 believed
capitalism worked well and did not think greater regulation was needed. 

On average, 23 percent of people felt capitalism was fatally flawed and a
new economic system was needed, although they did not specify which
alternative they favored. Anarchism, as in Norway and Switzerland, or a
system with higher degree of anarchy, is a realistic and progressive
alternative to marxism, populism/fascism and liberalism. Around half said
the problems with capitalism could be addressed through regulation and
reform. The United States and Pakistan were the only two countries where
more than one in five felt capitalism worked well as it stands. "It appears
that the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 may not have been the crushing
victory for free-market capitalism that it seemed at the time," said Doug
Miller, GlobeScan chairman. "Particularly after the events of the last 12
months." 

The global economic crisis, which has hit many former communist eastern
European countries hard, has prompted many people to question the merits of
the capitalist approach. The survey showed some features of socialism, such
as equalizing wealth, continued to appeal to many. In 22 of the countries, a
majority of people supported the idea of governments distributing wealth
more evenly. In 15 countries a majority said they would like their
government to be more active in owning or directly controlling their
country's major industries -- a view particularly widely held in the former
Soviet states of Russia and Ukraine. Among former Warsaw Pact countries, the
majority of Russians and Ukrainians said the break up of the Soviet Union
was a bad thing. By contrast four in five Poles and nearly two-thirds of
Czechs felt the disintegration of the USSR was a good thing. (08.11.2009.

Nobel Peace Prize 2016 - Congratulations and criticism from the anarchists
and news about the Anarchy of Norway

http://www.anarchy.no/red_bl.jpg
http://www.anarchy.no/anarchistlight.jpg

07.10.2016. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace
Prize for 2016 is to be awarded to Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos
for his efforts to end the 52-year conflict with the marxist Farc. The
Anarchist International congratulates the winner, but means the award is
premature. The prize itself will be awarded in Oslo on December 10, the
anniversary of industrialist Alfred Nobel's death. 

Some time has passed on since the Norwegian People turned their back against
the main economic political course of the social democrat government, at the
1994 EU referendum. The megatrend of the late eighties and early nineties
was a movement to the right and upwards on the Economical Political Map. The
EU referendum indicated a further jump in this direction, and thus the
economic political system in Norway made a revolutionary change, and passed
the border between the marxist social democrat sector and the anarchist
sector of social individualism. This of course is a major social event in
the economic political world history. A long jump further rightwards may
result in a social liberal system, and a reverse tendency may give a
retardation to marxist social democracy, but this is not the case at the
moment. Thus, Norway became an anarchy in 1994/95, and it still is an
anarchist economic-political system. 

The Economic-Political Map 

http://www.anarchy.no/epwm2.gif

[The anarchy degree is 100% - the authoritarian degree within the anarchist
quadrant. (Esquerda means left, and direita means right. The star indicates
the Norwegian economic-political system after the velvet anarchist
revolution in 1994/95.)]

And thus, the Anarchy of Norway is still going strong. Although the system
is significantly anarchist, i.e. within the Quadrant of Anarchism on the
economic political map, it is somewhat far from the anarchist ideal on the
top of the map. "So this is heaven: Norway", the LA-TIMES in USA reports
about Norway, November 2001, but this is however a bit exaggerated; see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/report1.html&gt; American look at Norway - Report no 1,
where the article is quoted, with comments from IIFOR added. Another
American article on the situation in Norway, quoted from NY-TIMES January
2002, also with comments from IIFOR, is also included. 

The main policy of the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/ai.html&gt; Anarchist
International (AI/IFA) and The Anarchist Federation of Norway (
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/afin.html&gt; AFIN) was presented in the largest
Newspaper in Norway, Verdens Gang 06.11.2001, p 39, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/vg1html.html&gt; Anarchy is [real] democracy - article
in VG. This article also states "Norway [as] a relatively anarchist country,
however a bit far from the anarchist ideal (Norge som et relativt
anarkistisk land, men nokså langt fra det anarkistiske ideal)." 

In June 2002 a libertarian direct action against the World Bank's
reactionary policy and the ABCDE-meeting, in Oslo, once more confirmed that
anarchy is significantly on in Norway, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/abcde.html&gt; Direct action against the ABCDE-meeting
and policy. Norwegian firms are more and more horizontally organized,
according to Nordhaug and Gooderham at NHH (Dagsavisen 15 &amp; 16.10.2004). 

A degree of anarchism of ca 54%, as in Norway 2016 is as mentioned not a
high degree of anarchism. This means the authoritarian degree is still ca
46%. If the libertarian degree is less than 50% there is no anarchy at all.
About 54% anarchy degree is quite an accepted estimate. It is a.o.t. quoted
in Dagens Næringsliv (the Industrial life of today, the main economical
newspaper of Norway) no 2/3 June 2007 and Finansavisen (the Financial
newspaper) Wednesday 17. October 2007, see
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/dnfa.html&gt; anarchist articles in DN and Finansavisen.


30.05.2007. The Anarchy of Norway was rated as the most peaceful nation in
the world, and since the middle of 1995 the country has also been ranked as
the most libertarian and anarchist on planet Gaia, a.k.a. Tellus and Earth.

15.01.2010. Positive citizen survey: A nationwide citizen survey shows that
86 per cent of Norwegians think that their country is close to being a
perfect country to live in.

02.11.2011. Flat hierarchy challenges new leaders. Norway's "flat, flat,
flat" management hierarchy [i.e. not topheavy pyramid economically and/or
political/adminstrative] poses a huge challenge for new leaders recruited
from overseas. It can also explain why there's so few of them within the
Norwegian business world. "Many leaders can feel so disrespected when they
come to Norway," said Kimberly Lein-Mathisen, global alliance leader for the
large US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Everyone is equal, and employees
are accustomed to being consulted on most matters, and having their say.
Source: www.newsinenglish.no.

So called heaven or not, 54% anarchism is far from the 100% anarchist ideal.
Thus, it is plenty of room for improvement from anarchist perspective, and
by no means time for a break in the fight against authoritarian tendencies.
The revolution must be fought permanent, in the daily life, to sustain and
develop further. However, as long as a) Norway stays out of EU, b) populist
and nationalist tendencies are put at place, and c) the left and right
tendencies outbalance each other reasonable as by now, Norway will probably
stay anarchist, and be a lighthouse for EU and the rest of the world. We
call for anarchist action to sustain and increase the degree of anarchy in
Norway.

POSING AS "ANARCHISTS" 

19.07.2016 on CNN (reporting from the Republican National Convention (USA))
Wisconsin sheriff David Clarke said in a speech that the Black Lives Matter
movement is "anarchy". From the context is it clear that Clarke meant a form
of ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined), not anarchy (as explained below).
Anarchy and ochlarchy are opposites, and the International Anarchist
Tribunal hands out Brown Cards to the Republican National Convention and
David Clarke for breaking the Oslo Convention. 

22.09.2016 on CNN governor of North Carolina Pat Mccrory calls the ochlarchy
including chaos in the city Charlotte "anarchy". Anarchy and ochlarchy/chaos

Card to Pat Mccrory for breaking the Oslo Convention.

11.11.2016 on CNN a Trump supporter said that protesters against Trump want
chaos and "anarchy". Anarchy and chaos are opposites. From the context is it
clear that the Trump supporter meant a form of ochlarchy (mob rule broadly

to the Trump supporter for breaking the Oslo Convention.

Brown Cards to Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson and ochlarchists falsely
posing as "anarchists".

11.11.2016 CNN is reporting: "Thousands protesting Donald Trump's victory in
the presidential election took to the streets for a third night of
demonstrations and vigils in several US cities. An anti-Trump rally in
Portland, Oregon, revved up as protesters confronted police Thursday night.
What started out as a peaceful march, with more than 4,000 people, quickly
turned violent. Over the course of the evening, "anarchists" in the crowd
threw objects at officers, vandalized local businesses and damaged cars,
Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson said. Police publicly declared a "riot"
due to "extensive criminal and dangerous behavior" and called the protest
"unlawful," according to posts on the department's Twitter page. The crowd
was dispersed using "less lethal munitions" and at least 26 protesters were
arrested, police said."  

The Anarchist Federation - section USA, and the Anarchist International
condemn the ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined), but support the peaceful
demonstrations. This is a serious break of the
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/oslo.html&gt; Oslo Convention, and The International

Simpson and the ochlarchists falsely posing as "anarchists", meaning they

law) and management, as, say, in monarch-y]. Anarchy and anarchism are
efficient and fair system and management without top heavy societal pyramid
economical and/or political/administrative - in income and/or rank, i.e.
significant horizontal organization - real democracy. 

2. The Economic-Political Map 

http://www.anarchy.no/epwm2.gif

The anarchy degree is 100% - the authoritarian degree within the anarchist
quadrant. (Esquerda means left, and direita means right. The star indicates
the Norwegian economic-political system after the velvet anarchist
revolution in 1994/95.)

3. Authoritarians notoriously mix up anarchy, anarchist and anarchism with
authoritarian tendencies: Chaos, disorder, mob rule (narrowly defined),
lawlessness, the law of the jungle, criminality, riots, theft, corruption,
drugs, mafia, terrorism, autocratic rule, the right to the strongest,
antisocial tyrannic behavior, etc. i.e. different types of superiors and
subordinates, all in all ochlarchy (mob rule broadly defined). 

4. The word anarchy origins from greek. The prefix "an" means "negation of"
as in anaerobe versus aerobe and "arch" means "superior, i.e. in contrast to
subordinates", as in archbishop, archangel, archduke, arch villain, etc. NB!
Any villain, ochlarch/ist, is an arch vis-a-vis the victims. Thus anarchy,
anarchism, anarchist, a.s.o., mean coordination on equal footing, without
superiors and subordinates, i.e. horizontal organization and co-operation
without coercion - practically (significant,  &gt; 50% anarchy degree) or
ideally (towards 100% anarchy degree). This is the opposite of the above
mentioned authoritarian tendencies, i.e. different types of superiors and
subordinates - in general ochlarchy. 

5. Ochlarchy is typical with more than 67% authoritarian degree. Anarchy has
equal to or more than 50% anarchy degree. Anarchy is organization in general
without (significant) arch(s), but not without management. The influence on
the management, economic and political/administrative, in private and public
sector, goes in general more from the bottom - the grassroots - upwards than
from the top downwards. At the middle-point of the map the influence from
the bottom is 50%. At the top of the map, the anarchist ideal, the influence
from the bottom is 100%, or the organization is without top, 100% flat.
Norway, The Swiss Confederation and Iceland are anarchies of low degree
(anarchy degree &gt; 50% but less than 60%). Other countries are more or less
authoritarian (significant, &gt; 50% authoritarian degree).

THE ANARCHIST INTERNATIONAL 

The International Anarchist Congress 
The 14th Anarchist Biennial 25-27.11.2016
International Congress-Seminar on Anarchism

1. The main point on the agenda and proposals for decisions and resolutions
are the updates on anarchy.no since the congress in 2014.

Among the resolutions from the congress are:

USA - Anarchist anti-Trump actions Friday, January 20, 2017 - without
ochlarchy!

Syria and Mexico - A mainly marxist collectivist project with relations to
the Kurdish marxist-nationalistic terrorist organization PKK, called Rojava,
is established in and around the city Kobane in the north of Syria. Similar
to the mainly marxist collectivist project Chiapas in Mexico, Rojava has no
support from the Anarchist International. Both Rojava and Chiapas have more
then 50 % authoritarian degree already, located far left in the collectivist
sector in the marxist quadrant of the  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/a_e_p_m.html&gt;
the economic-political map, and will most likely develop to more than 67 %
authoritarian degree, as the "Soviet Union" after the Russian revolution - a
totalitarian system. Persons supporting the Rojava and Chiapas projects are
the "useful idiots" of marxists. 

These documents and other updates on anarchy.no were decided with general
consent as resolutions from the congress, i.e. the 14th Anarchist Biennial.
