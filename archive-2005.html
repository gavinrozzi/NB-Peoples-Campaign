Oscar Lopez Rivera:  A Special Interview for Claridad
Eduardo Villanueva/Special to Claridad Newspaper Translated by Frank Velgara
of ProLibertad

Today, October 15, 2004, Terre Haute, Indiana, in the U.S., I am visiting
and conversing with Oscar Lopez Rivera, one of our political prisoners and a
remnant of the days of  The Cold War.

He is 61 years old, small in build and has the stature of our traditional
Puerto Rican peasant farmers.  He has a strong complexion with black eyes
that glitter sharply and seem to be deeply piercing like the scalpel of an
experienced surgeon.  He has a full mustache that he takes care of
meticulously and a well combed pony tail in his hair that is barely
noticeable in the scarce hair on his strikingly strong head.

His innate timidity falls away after breaking the ice and he embarks on a
profound conversation which is logical, coherent and ingenious and seems to
negate the effects of 23 years of incarceration.  During these 23 years, he
served 12 years in Marion one of the cruelest and most inhumane prisons in
the world.  He has been deprived of physical contact, and limited in his
phone calls and visits in an attempt to break an indomitable spirit that is
always with him and is reflected in each action in his rich and complex
life.

He is a man of courage, self-taught, and disciplined.  He is willing to
methodically organize the oppressed masses that languish in the Diaspora in
the United States and who are suffocated by racism and the hatred that
imperialism unleashes against all those who challenge its hegemony.

From the beginning you are impressed that throughout an extensive
conversation that covers topics such as history, literature, sports,
sociology and spiritual agnosticism, you seem to be with a Catholic
Protestant, who is not interested in fishing for votes.  You don�t hear
complaints, pessimism, feelinga of hatred or resentment coming from the
suffering he has had to endure because of his love of the homeland and his
revolutionary vocation.  Oscar never complains nor does he engage in long
lamentations of all that he has had to suffer in prison because of his
ideals.

Few people know in detail the physical isolation and sensory deprivation
that he was subjected to at Marion.  Few also know what the jailers at
Florence subjected Oscar to during his first 6 years of imprisonment there.
For 58 days they woke him every 30 minutes with a bright light in order to
deprive him of any rest and to prevent him from getting any uninterrupted
sleep.  These are barbaric acts that only a spirit who is committed to the
highest ideals of freedom can endure in the name of the love for his people.

Few people in the so-called free community are better informed than Oscar
about the reality of his country.  He is familiar with all the ideological
tendencies in the independence movement, their views and leaders, their
weaknesses and strengths.   He recognizes the persistence, honesty,
dedication and patriotism of leaders whose activity he has followed and
carefully studied.   He condemns that fact that some political movements
have become so bureaucratized and sometimes to the point of risking
disappearing altogether.  But he recognizes that the diversity of the
struggle and implementation of tactics and strategy have made it impossible
for the empire to exterminate us despite all their repressive strategies and
actions. They have been unleashed against us and are directed at violating
our civil rights and our right to self-determination.

By listening respectfully and reflecting on his thinking and views, you can
clearly come to understand why his jailers and U.S. intelligence agencies
fear him to the point that they fabricated a supposed escape attempt in
order to lengthen his sentence to 78 years in jail which is what it is
today.

Oscar enjoys writing to the youth with whom he is in contact.  They  benefit
from his teaching abilities and his self-taught knowledge.  Some professors
invite Oscar to contact their students so that they can deepen their
understanding of the political process in Puerto Rico, colonialism, the
anti-imperialist struggle, the need for revolutionary changes and the
dialectical process that allows a political prisoner to transform his
incarceration and his separation from his loved ones into an experience of
liberation and personal growth.

Oscar is very aware of his role as a patriotic role model although he
doesn�t mention it or brag about it.  That is why in his writings he is
careful not to promote farfetched or irresponsible ideas and to reject ideas
that promote any personality cult. He rejects this because he considers it
pure vanity and because he has learned from the negative impact that it has
had in the ongoing revolutionary  struggle for social change as it pertains
to other political leaders.

In thinking about his role with youth I would dare say  that Oscar believes
as does Benedetti that: �the moral health and spiritual clarity of a young
person will be the probable guarantee that the continuation of life will
likely be clean and honest� (Benedetti, Memoria y Esperanza, P�g. 28).

I reflect upon the experience of being in such intense proximity to the soul
of an incarcerated patriot and I think of the inexorable and
incomprehensible absurdity that the freedom of the homeland demands such
painful steps in its movement forward -- the existence of political
prisoners.  I believe that today as always the people have a moral
obligation to demand that they all return home.

Vieques Political Prisoner, Jose Perez Gonzalez, has sent us a statement for 
the New Year 2005; please read and write to Jose Perez Gonzalez at the 
address at the end of the statement.


Who is Jose Perez Gonzalez #21519-069?
Jose is from Ponce, Puerto Rico; he is the son of a butcher and his mother 
is retired government worker. He is married with three children. He is a 
member of Mayaguezano por La Salud y el Ambiente. He is well known in his 
neighborhood, of Barrio Segundo in Ponce. He was a civil disobedient and 
served three months in jail for his support activities. Jose was the only 
member of the Vieques 12 who went to trial. He was found guilty and was 
sentenced to five years in jail.  His release date is 1/17/2008 .


December 24, 2004

Dearest friends and compa�eros:

I write these few lines in order to express my appreciation to all of you 
for the great support and love that you have offered throughout my sentence 
and especially so to my family who are the ones who are truly are suffering 
this incarceration.  I cannot speak of suffering when others have suffered 
more than I and I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

I have already been transferred to the medium security prison in Edgefield, 
South Carolina, where I will complete my unjust sentence.  But I will do so 
with much pride and always with a high level of dignity.  A hurricane or 
other tragedy can destroy a country, a city or our home, but never our 
spirit of struggle, something that many people in this beautiful country 
lack.

One who suffers for his homeland and lives for God, in this world or 
another, has true glory.  While all is not being done, no one has a right to 
rest.  We are the barriers to this current despotism.  What is given to 
others, we are the ones who have obtained it.  We are the school, the whip, 
the reality, solace and consolation.  We unite what others divide.  We do 
not die.  We are the reserves of the homeland.

The homeland is continuity of interests, unifying traditions, unity of 
goals, sweet fusion and consolation of love and hope.

Well compa�eros, here I will rid myself of that which will never serve me 
and strengthen the good that I have within me.  Beyond the reprisals, the 
increase in the severity of my custody and of the individualized treatment I 
receive, I will continue to improve myself and will struggle to become a 
more useful patriot for the task I want to achieve.  This unjust sentence 
like the perverse mistreatment I receive will do nothing else but fortify my 
spirit.  I will make of this a fruitful experience that will allow me to 
graduate with honors as a dignified son of Puerto Rico.  As Jos� Mart� said; 
�The homeland has brought me here, to die for the homeland, is to enjoy and 
live even more�.

Receive from me a strong familial embrace, I love you all very much.  You 
may write to me at the address where I am confined.  The address should be 
as it appears below.

LONG LIVE A FREE AND SOVEREIGN PUERTO RICO!!

FREEDOM FOR ALL THE PUERTO RICAN POLITCAL PRISONERS!!

HAPPY NEW YEAR 2005!!

The following is a message from Nazomi Ikuta, a compa�era who has been 
essential in doing political prisoner work in the religious community for 
many years.

On Friday [January 14], Rev. Jose "Viejo" Torres, pastor emeritus of the 
First Congregational Church in Chicago, father of Puerto Rican political 
prisoner Carlos Alberto Torres and husband of released political prisoner 
Alejandrina Torres, was admitted to Rush Hospital in Chicago. After running 
some tests they found tumors in his brain, along with cancer in his hip. He 
is being treated with steroids now to reduce inflammation and will begin 
radiation treatments during the week. As you may know he has been suffering 
from several other health problems but this adds an additional level of 
stress to his situation. Please keep him and his family in your thoughts and 
prayers.  Cards may be sent to:

Biography of Rev. Jos� Alberto Torres

Rev. Jos� Alberto Torres (El Viejo) was born on June 9, 1923 in Ponce, 
Puerto Rico. He completed his academic and theological studies in 1949, at 
the Interamerican University in San German and the Evangelical Seminary of 
Puerto Rico. In 1959, Rev. Torres was called by the Congregational Church in 
New York to work with the Hispanic community at Martha Memorial Evangelical 
and Reform Church in Manhattan. In 1962, Rev. Torres was called by the 
Community Renewal Society of Chicago to minister the growing Hispanic 
community at First Congregational Church of Chicago. During that time, Rev. 
Torres was interim director of Casa Central and an active participant of the 
Urban Training Center, two entities that were housed and supported by the 
First Congregational Church of Chicago. In 1990, Rev. Torres retires and is 
officially granted the status of Pastor Emeritus by the First Congregational 
Church of Chicago.

Rev. Torres was interim director of Casa Central and an active participant 
of the Urban Training Center, two entities that were housed and supported by 
the First Congregational Church of Chicago. In 1990, Rev. Torres retires and 
is officially granted the status of Pastor Emeritus by the First 
Congregational Church of Chicago.

Rev. Torres was instrumental in involving the Church in the issues that were 
affecting the Puerto Rican community at the time. Issues that ranged from 
residential displacement as a result of the urban renewal project, to better 
housing, education, employment and community rights and presentation in 
local politics.

Since his involvement with the United Church of Christ, the First Church has 
actively participated in support of civil and human rights issues of the 
Puerto Rican community and other under represented minorities. Rev. Torres 
marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma, Alabama in 1964 and was part 
of a group of ministers to bring Dr. King�s civil rights issues to the 
Puerto Rican community in Chicago. He has worked diligently for social 
justice and in various issues in the community. He was on the organizing 
committee of the first Puerto Rican Parade and the Peoples� Parade. He was 
the founding member of the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High School, the Puerto 
Rican Cultural Center and the Committee to Free the Puerto Rican Political 
Prisoners.

Rev. Torres has three children from a previous marriage, Carlos Alberto 
Torres (one of the remaining political prisoners), Norma and Nidza. He 
married Alejandrina in 1964 and has two children, Lisa and Catalina.

Peltier:

http://www.petitiononline.com/Clemency/petition.html

Invite others to sign the petition (see the links on the right side bar &amp; at 
the bottom of the petition page), Or create &amp; circulate your own hard copy 
petition.  The text of the parole petition follows.

JUSTICE FOR LEONARD PELTIER:  PETITION IN SUPPORT OF PAROLE

Convicted in connection with the deaths on June 26, 1975, of two agents of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Leonard Peltier has served nearly 30 
years in federal prison despite proof that he was convicted on the basis of 
fabricated &amp; suppressed evidence, as well as coerced testimony.

In violation of the U.S. Constitution &amp; the government's own congressionally 
mandated guidelines, Peltier has been denied fair consideration for parole.  
On February 1, 1994, the U.S. Parole Commission determined that Leonard 
Peltier would not be considered for parole for 15 years, or until December 
2008, after a total imprisonment of 394 months.  This amount is more than 
twice the 188+ months to be served based on Mr. Peltier's aggregate 
guideline range.  Further, the U.S. Parole Commission has failed to provide 
parole dates "consistent with the applicable parole guideline" to all "old 
system" prisoners, including Leonard Peltier, as mandated by Congress in the 
Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.

We, the undersigned, support justice &amp; human rights for all people of all 
nations; recognize that the U.S. courts, by their decisions, have recognized 
the undisputed misconduct in Peltier's case, yet have failed to take 
corrective action; determine the U.S. government's handling of the Peltier 
case as a clear abuse of the legal standards of American justice; &amp; do 
hereby call for justice for Leonard Peltier in the form of an immediate 
grant of parole.

Completed hard copy petitions should be mailed to the Leonard Peltier

The ProLibertad Freedom campaign sends its condolences to the Torres family 
in this time of great loss and tragedy;  we have lost a great leader in the 
Puerto Rican Nation.

Dear Friends:

It is with great sadness that I communicate that our dear Viejo (Reverend 
Jos� Alberto Torres) passed away this evening at about 6:00 p.m. Chicago 
time. He was at home surrounded by his daughters and his loving wife 
Alejandrina, who tomorrow will announce plans for the wake and funeral. 
Tomorrow his daughter Catalina will visit her brother Carlos Alberto, Puerto 
Rican political prisoner, to tell him this sad news. We are initiating a fax 
campaign to the Bureau of Prisons to permit Carlos to attend his father's 
funeral.  We offer a sample letter below, along with the BOP fax number.  
Faxes should be sent immediately.

Re: Carlos Alberto Torres, 88976-024

Oxford, WI 53952

Dear Director Lappin:

Having just learned the sad news that Carlos Alberto Torres' father finally 
succumbed to cancer on February 5, 2005, we write to urge you to allow him 
to attend his father's funeral. As you know, Carlos is one of the Puerto 
Rican political prisoners whose unconditional release was supported by a 
massive international public campaign which in 1999 led to a presidential 
commutation of eleven of his compatriots. As of April 4, 2005, Carlos will 
have served 25 years in prison, during which time he has consistently 
demonstrated conduct which is above reproach. During Rev. Torres' lengthy 
illness, prison officials at Oxford made Carlos' ability to receive visits 
from his ailing father more difficult. Alejandrina Torres, his step mother 
who raised him from a very tender age, was his father's main caregiver. She 
also happened to be one of the political prisoners released as a result of 
the 1999 presidential commutation. In spite of her wholly successful 
reintegration into civil society, Oxford officials refused to allow her to 
visit him. As a result of this cruel decision, Rev. Torres passed away 
without being able to enjoy a family reunion with his wife and his only son. 
We strongly urge you to extend to this family the humanitarian gesture of 
allowing Carlos to attend his father's funeral.

Yours truly,

Rican political prisoner, to tell him this sad news. We are initiating a fax
campaign to the Bureau of Prisons to permit Carlos to attend his father's
funeral.  We offer a sample letter below, along with the BOP fax number.
Faxes should be sent immediately.

Re: Carlos Alberto Torres, 88976-024

Oxford, WI 53952

Dear Director Lappin:

Having just learned the sad news that Carlos Alberto Torres' father finally
succumbed to cancer on February 5, 2005, we write to urge you to allow him
to attend his father's funeral. As you know, Carlos is one of the Puerto
Rican political prisoners whose unconditional release was supported by a
massive international public campaign which in 1999 led to a presidential
commutation of eleven of his compatriots. As of April 4, 2005, Carlos will
have served 25 years in prison, during which time he has consistently
demonstrated conduct which is above reproach. During Rev. Torres' lengthy
illness, prison officials at Oxford made Carlos' ability to receive visits
from his ailing father more difficult. Alejandrina Torres, his step mother
who raised him from a very tender age, was his father's main caregiver. She
also happened to be one of the political prisoners released as a result of
the 1999 presidential commutation. In spite of her wholly successful
reintegration into civil society, Oxford officials refused to allow her to
visit him. As a result of this cruel decision, Rev. Torres passed away
without being able to enjoy a family reunion with his wife and his only son.
We strongly urge you to extend to this family the humanitarian gesture of
allowing Carlos to attend his father's funeral.

Yours truly,

Name

PRESS RELEASE

The Socialist Front of Puerto Rico
March 18, 2005

Spokespersons:  Jorge Farinacci Garc�a, 502-9756; Ricardo Santos Ortiz,
644-2998; Rafael Bernabe Riefkohl, 787-225-7071; Hugo Delgado , 787-403-2884
fax: (787) 722-8112

The Socialist Front Rejects The Attempt By The National Hostosiano
Independence
Movement (MINH) To Subordinate The Independence Movement To the
Popular Democratic Party (PPD) And Applauds Actions By Representative Javier
Garc�a Cab�n

The Socialist Front, an organization with a long history of anti-colonial
struggle, repudiates the constant attempts by leaders of the National
Hostosiano Independence Movement (MINH) to transform the independence
movement into a submissive and subordinate entity of the Popular Democratic
Party (PPD).  The current debate on the status of Puerto Rico has made clear
the posture of surrender and collaboration of this sector of the
independence movement. This sector is more concerned with reaching
agreements with the Popular Democratic Party than it is in articulating a
firm strategy of struggle for the independence of Puerto Rico. The fact that
they have opted to attack the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) for not
supporting the colonial constituent project and their silence in face of the
support of the substitute project by the PPD leadership, shows that their
reason for being is to serve as a shield for that party.

The Socialist Front wants make clear that this sector does not represent the
majority of the Puerto Rican independence movement which in its varios
expressions � such as the PIP, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, and the
EPB-Macheteros, among others, have maintained a firm and independent
position both in regard to U.S. imperialism and toward the colonialists of
the Popular Democratic Party (PPD).  With these actions and positions the
National Hostosiano Independence Movement (MINH), increasingly distances
itself from the Puerto Rican national liberation movement.

The independence movement cannot bind its future to the whims of the
colonialist party.   It also cannot fall into the trap of thinking that the
New Progressive Party (PNP) is an anti-colonial party.  The Socialist Front
applauds the actions of representative Javier Garc�a Cab�n who, in evident
contradiction with the colonialist majority of the PNP and the PPD,
submitted an amendment to the substitute project so that it would be known
that any Referendum to be submitted to the people should include a call to
remove Puerto Rico from the Territorial Clause of the United States
Constitution.  The Socialist Front made a similar proposal during the
hearings in the House and Senate.  Anyone who would calls themselves
anti-colonialists should begin by demanding the immediate removal of Puerto
Rico from that clause � anything else is to operate within the confines of
the colony.

In Puerto Rico there will not be a genuine process of decolonization lead by
people such as An�bal Acevedo Vil� and Luis Fortu�o.  The Socialist Front
calls on the entire independence movement to concentrate our efforts in
bringing the rest of the anti-colonialist sectors among the people to
positions of struggle and toward not wasting time with the maneuverings of
the political hacks of the PPD and the PNP.

Despierta Boricua is a weekly fifteen minute Radio segment produced for WBAI
99.5 FM Friday Morning Wake UP Call by The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign.
Despierta Boricua airs at 6:45am, but is subject to re-scheduling depending
on the Station�s needs.

Despierta Boricua is dedicated to providing the New York City listening
audience with the latest news and updates on Puerto Rican politics and
culture from U.S. based Puerto Rican communities and the island of Puerto
Rico.

This month�s Despierta Boricuas are dedicated to the contributions of Puerto
Rican Women in arts, politics, history and culture.

This week�s segment features an interview with several sisters from Yaya.  
Yaya is a women's collective dedicated to preserving and promoting the rich, 
cultural legacies and Africa-based musical traditions of Puerto Rico and the 
Dominican Republic. Founded in 2002, Yaya honors the vibrant musical 
heritage represented in Puerto Rican bomba and Dominican salve traditions, 
through live performance, workshops, and female-led, creative ciphers. 
Recognizing the contributions of women in preserving and transmitting these 
traditions, Yaya honors the yayas (Creole/Kongo origin), or mothers, who 
have helped shape our histories, traditions and legacies of resistance.

Contact Info for Yaya:

movement. She is serving a 55-year sentence on charges of seditious
conspiracy, among others. She completed an 8-year state sentence. After
years of separation, she has been reunited with her son Guillermo.

Who is Dylcia Pag�n???

Dylcia Pag�n is one of the 11 Puerto Rican former political prisoners
granted clemency by President Clinton in September 1999. She immediately
returned to Puerto Rico, where she and her compa�eros/as were met with a
huge welcome celebration.

The background description below is adapted from Can't Jail the Spirit
(March 1998).

Dylcia Pag�n was born in "El Barrio" in New York City on October 15, 1946.
She attended Brooklyn College were she majored in Cinematography and
Sociology, participated in the struggle for students' rights and founded the
Puerto Rican Students Union. She taught social studies in the New York City
school system, worked for ABC, NBC, and CBS and also for the daily newspaper
El Tiempo.

Dylcia was captured April 4, 1980 along with other comrades, for
participating in the underground wing of the Puerto Rican independence
movement. She is serving a 55-year sentence on charges of seditious
conspiracy, among others. She completed an 8-year state sentence. After
years of separation, she has been reunited with her son Guillermo.

Dylcia's patriotism has manifested itself in many artistic forms which
include painting, ceramics, poetry and her writings. She has participated in
the production of a video about her life and lives of her compa�eros in the
struggle. While in prison, she helped direct a documentary about the Puerto
Rican Women Prisoners of War.

Her biography has been published in Puerto Rican Women: A History of
Oppression and Resistance. Dylcia's poetry has appeared in Have You Seen La
Nueva Mujer Puertorrique�a? Part of Dylcia's life story was also included in
a book by the anthropologist, John Langston Gwaltney entitled, The
Dissenters: Voices from Contemporary America.

Throughout her capture, trial and incarceration she has maintained her
position as an anti-colonial prisoner of war (POW) resisting the illegal
U.S. occupation of her homeland.

OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA HAS BEEN MOVED!!

On April 12th, Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Oscar Lopez Rivera was moved 
from the Federal Correctional Institution in in Terre Haute, Indiana to the 
U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute.

According to a letter ProLibertad received from Oscar Lopez Rivera, the 
Penitentiary is larger than the Federal Correctional Institution;  the 
Penitentiary is also behind walls.

In his last prison, Oscar could see the trees, had access to the birds, and 
to a nice running track.  In the new prison, all the units are separated 
from each other; in order to go from unit to another he has to go outside 
and walk from building to building.

According to Oscar, on his first day there, he had to walk in the rain to 
get to the commissary to eat; he arrived soaking wet.  Oscar also commented 
that the new prison is like a military camp because they have to wear a 
Khaki uniform and boots all of the time.

Oscar has also commented that there is not enough space provided for artists 
to work. According to Oscar, there is plenty of space, but that the artists 
are relegated to a small area, where they are, �on top of each other.�  He 
is going to be sending us information soon about how we can support him and 
the other artists.

If you want to write to Oscar, please send him a letter or postcard to:

SUPPORT THE VIEQUES POLITICAL PRISONERS!!

The Vieques Political Prisoners are activists, community members and 
residents of Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that were targeted by the FBI for 
their activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the 
initial 12 Vieques activists in June 2003 was another attempt by the FBI and 
U.S. government to repress and punish Vieques activists for participating in 
the struggle to remove the U.S. Navy from Vieques.

It was also an attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle 
to achieve the four demands of the People of Vieques 
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

When the Vieques Political Prisoners were incarcerated, many of their 
families lost their sole source of income.  Also, as prisoners, the Vieques 
Political Prisoners need commissary donations in order to buy toiletries, 
paper goods and extra food.

In order to deal with these needs, an account was established in Puerto Rico 
by Todo Puerto Rico con Vieques (All of Puerto Rico with Vieques) to collect 
money for the prisoners and their families.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is urging all our allies and supporters to 
send donations to the Vieques Political Prisoners and their families.  Todo 
Puerto Rico con Vieques will disseminate the money to the prisoners and 
their families:

Because finding love is tough enough, dating services especially for

On May 13th, 1985, the U.S. government in complicity with state and
city officials, dropped a bomb on the MOVE Organization in Philadelphia. 6
adults, 5 children and many animals were murdered by the bomb-induced
fire as well as the police bullets they faced trying to escape the blaze.

Many people do not know that the government tried desperately to
silence MOVE in large part due to their defiant, consistent protest on 
behalf
of the incarcerated MOVE 9. The government was threatened by the
possibility of having to admit their wrongdoing in the conviction of the 
MOVE 9. To
eliminate this threat the government knowingly conspired to kill MOVE.

This government has provided constant examples of their willingess to
beat, torture, jail, bomb, or kill anybody that stands for truth,
righteousness, equality, and justice? principles this government claims to 
represent
but has never represented. All of us fighting for what�s right are a threat
and a target. Our only safety is to fight back! In recognition of the MOVE
soldiers who gave their lives, and in self- protection, we must take a
stand and never let them forget! In honor of those killed May 13th we
MUST fight to FREE the MOVE 9!

Join us Saturday, May 14th, 2005 as we demand acknowledgement of this
atrocity, and demand the release of the MOVE 9!!! We will be meeting at
10:30 am on 63rd and Osage Ave. in West Philadelphia (the original site
of the bombing) for a rally and march throughout West Philadephia!

yet refuse to defend it--at that moment you begin to die. And I have never
seen so many corpses walking around talking about justice." --Mumia

Esperanza Martell To Espe her art is an expression of her politics,
culture/spirituality. Her African/Taino ancestors used art magically in
healing and to give meaning to their existence. She does the same by
creating ceramic sculpture from nothing, allowing total self-expression. She
hand builds, using traditional images and methods and is inspired by the
earth/ocean/stars. She hopes her work opens individuals to their historical
roots generating healing and power.

Rephstar (www.rephstar.com) Rephstar is an MC, Producer, Dancer, Mixed Media
visual artist and activist. He developed his love for the visual arts
through writing and appreciating the graffiti on walls throughout Manhattan.
That coupled with a passion for technology, history and social change is
what led him to the work he is doing today with computer graphics, video and
sound. Rephstar visions his work as a reflection of the human experience
through the eyes of the Hip-Hop generation. Peace, MiLs 646-772-6081

Esperanza Martell To Espe her art is an expression of her politics,
culture/spirituality. Her African/Taino ancestors used art magically in
healing and to give meaning to their existence. She does the same by
creating ceramic sculpture from nothing, allowing total self-expression. She
hand builds, using traditional images and methods and is inspired by the
earth/ocean/stars. She hopes her work opens individuals to their historical
roots generating healing and power.

Rephstar (www.rephstar.com) Rephstar is an MC, Producer, Dancer, Mixed Media
visual artist and activist. He developed his love for the visual arts
through writing and appreciating the graffiti on walls throughout Manhattan.
That coupled with a passion for technology, history and social change is
what led him to the work he is doing today with computer graphics, video and
sound. Rephstar visions his work as a reflection of the human experience
through the eyes of the Hip-Hop generation. Peace, MiLs 646-772-6081

HAPPY 50TH BIRTHDAY HAYDEE BENTRAN!!

On June 7th of this year, Haydee Beltran Torres, one of three Puerto Rican 
Political Prisoners, will be turning 50 YEARS YOUNG!!

For the past 25 years (HALF OF HER LIFE), she has been incarcerated for 
fighting for the freedom and self-determination of her homeland Puerto Rico; 
a colony of the United States for 106 years.

Haydee Beltran Torres was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico on June 7, 1955.  
When Haydee was 12 years old, her parents moved to Chicago.  At Tuley High 
School, she organized a boycott that demanded the firing of a racist 
principal.  Haydee attended the University of Illinois where she was an 
outspoken defender of Latino students� rights.

Haydee was forced underground in 1976 and was captured April 4, 1980.  She 
has been sentenced to life in prison on charges including seditious 
conspiracy.  Haydee was the first POW to receive a life sentence.  She was 
kept in total isolation from the other prisoners of war and was transferred 
to a special control unit which limited visits.  It was a year before she 
was allowed to see her family.  At the MCC in Chicago, she was classified as 
�no visitors allowed�.  Haydee was subject to physical abuse in 
interrogations for refusing to implicate her comrades in unfounded crimes.  
This was done several times by FBI and other government agents.  These and 
other inhumane acts by the U.S. government have led to serious injuries, 
which prison medical directors have misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received 
injections of unknown medications.

To celebrate her birthday, The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling on 
all our allies and supporters to send her birthday cards, postcards or 
letters.  Let Haydee know that we love her, support her, and wish her a 
great 50!!

Several months ago, ProLibertad  reported on Oscar Lopez Rivera�s transfer; 
this article was written by Jan Susler for the National Boricua  Human 
Rights Network about Oscar current conditions


Posted Tuesday, June 28, 2005

April of this year marked the 25th anniversary of the arrest of eleven 
Puerto Rican political prisoners. April also marked the opening of an art 
exhibit featuring paintings and ceramics created by two remaining Puerto 
Rican political prisoners, Oscar L�pez Rivera and Carlos Alberto Torres... 
an exhibit scheduled to travel throughout the United States and Latin 
America. Not coincidentally, after having served 24 years of a 70 year 
sentence, April also marked Oscar�s unsolicited transfer from one maximum 
security prison to another... a prison where he not only has more difficulty 
maintaining his health and his family and community ties, but where painting 
is virtually impossible.

While prison officials would undoubtedly deny that Oscar�s transfer was 
punitive, its consequences are undeniably punitive. The new prison is not 
simply a disruption of his routine, not a mere matter of the inconvenience 
of the new requirements to be always fully dressed in khaki uniform and 
boots (U.S. military castoffs, all), or weathering the elements�without 
benefit of rain gear�as he makes his way from the cellblock to chow, or 
sleeping on the small plastic mattress that makes noise with every move. The 
new prison even further restricts his already restricted contact with the 
outside world. Visits from friends and family, never encouraged, are 
actively discouraged at the new prison. In June, his family was made to wait 
close to three hours before granted entry, while a sole officer ploddingly 
processed other visitors through drug testing and paper pushing, leaving 
only a few hours for the visit. And they were lucky, as some families were 
turned away completely, either for mistaken drug test results� which has 
previously happened with Oscar�s family---or because the officer took so 
frightfully long processing other families, the visiting day ended before he 
reached many of those waiting.

News media, which have interviewed Oscar in virtually every prison in which 
he has been held, is turned away. For example, Univision�s May request to 
interview him was spurned, allegedly due to �security,� although media was 
granted access to him in the more maximum security prisons in years 
previous. Such a ban only increases the risk to Oscar and others held there, 
as it lulls prison authorities to act with impunity and prevents public 
access to a public institution. Witness recent disclosures of the military�s 
refusal to allow media or United Nations access to staff or detainees at 
Guant�namo, not only hiding from public light their ongoing torture, but 
ensuring that it may continue with impunity. Ever since the United States 
began to use Guant�namo as a �terrorist� detention camp, United Nations 
human rights investigators have sought to visit Guant�namo and obtain full 
access to the facilities and prison population, but the U.S. has never 
allowed such access. The military refused to give the New York Times 
permission to interview physicians at Guant�namo about their having aided 
interrogators in conducting and refining coercive interrogations of 
detainees, including providing advice on how to increase stress levels and 
exploit fears, with a purpose of helping interrogators break the detainees.

Painting, one of the few outlets of creative expression available to him at 
the previous penitentiary, was simply not available when he arrived. 
Officials �lost� the majority of his painting supplies in the move to the 
new prison, but those can be replaced, albeit at great expense. The problem 
lies in the supposed lack of space. The problem is that, in the huge new 
prison, fashioned of large buildings, officials have refused to designate 
adequate space for this positive activity, creating in its place 
frustration. Having seen the tiny space available, he writes, �The area 
designated for us to paint is about the size of a cell, without any 
ventilation, sink or proper lighting. There are four easels standing and 
there�s no more room. There are about ten prisoners who paint. So right now 
I don�t know if I�m going to be able to continue painting.�

Exercise, another of the few outlets available in the previous penitentiary, 
has likewise been limited. At age 62, Oscar has managed to remain healthy, 
energetic, and productive in spite of, not because of, his surroundings. At 
the new prison, however, his ability to maintain his health is threatened by 
new limitations, such as no equipment to exercise the upper body (no 
weights, pull-up bars, dip bars), and a hard surface track that is bound to 
injure the joints with repeated use. His skin, extremely sensitive since his 
exposure to Agent Orange in Viet Nam, requires special soap which he is not 
sure will be available through the commissary of the new prison. He already 
knows that dental floss, so necessary for the prevention of tooth decay and 
gum disease, is considered a security risk and is therefore not available.

These conditions must be put in the overall perspective of the new 
penitentiary. The team responsible for designing and building it proudly 
describes their project: �Twenty-first century correctional facility design 
emphasizes security, function and workability, new technologies, staff 
efficiency and livability.� A construction magazine glorifies the structure 
as follows: �An inwardly focused series of more than a dozen buildings 
offers inmates little opportunity to look out of the site and dream of 
escape.� �A secured corridor of enclosed space surrounds the compound. The 
corridor's interior wall is the back sides of the housing pods, and the 
exterior wall is composed of precast concrete wall panels, described the 
construction company�s vice president. Beyond that is "no man's land" and 
three circuits of taut-wire fencing. Six guard towers with sight lines into 
the compound are just outside the fencing, and a seventh guard tower is back 
in the middle of the compound.� �Closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the 
prison's critical areas, and a control room outside the secured perimeter 
can open and close key access points into structures that include the 
housing pods, the secured corridor and the main entrance.

The 960 cells measure approximately 7 feet wide by 14 feet long, fabricated 
of precast concrete. The cells are formed as five-sided boxes - four walls 
and a roof. Two cells, one atop another, make up a unit. A balcony fronts 
the upper cell.

And, yes, the new prison includes a �special housing unit� where the federal 
death penalty will be carried out.

Oscar is ever clear in the reason why he is where he is, sure of who he is, 
and of his commitment to the independence of his nation, and even though he 
patiently and optimistically adjusts to the new surroundings, all the while 
resisting the encroaching limitations, living the salutation all his letters 
bear: �en resistencia y lucha� [in resistance and struggle]. However, since 
911, prison conditions have worsened across the board, especially 
jeopardizing the health, safety and lives of our political prisoners. A 
reporter with extensive experience covering U.S. prisons and jails, 
remarking on the revelations of torture in Abu Ghraib, said, �the images 
from Iraq looked all too American to me,� noting similar patterns of 
physical and psychological abuse in the atmosphere of increasing 
militarization of imprisonment in the U.S. We must therefore be vigilant of 
his human rights while we make every effort to achieve his and Carlos 
Alberto�s release.

construction company�s vice president. Beyond that is "no man's land" and 
three circuits of taut-wire fencing. Six guard towers with sight lines into 
the compound are just outside the fencing, and a seventh guard tower is back 
in the middle of the compound.� �Closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the 
prison's critical areas, and a control room outside the secured perimeter 
can open and close key access points into structures that include the 
housing pods, the secured corridor and the main entrance.

The 960 cells measure approximately 7 feet wide by 14 feet long, fabricated 
of precast concrete. The cells are formed as five-sided boxes - four walls 
and a roof. Two cells, one atop another, make up a unit. A balcony fronts 
the upper cell.

And, yes, the new prison includes a �special housing unit� where the federal 
death penalty will be carried out.

Oscar is ever clear in the reason why he is where he is, sure of who he is, 
and of his commitment to the independence of his nation, and even though he 
patiently and optimistically adjusts to the new surroundings, all the while 
resisting the encroaching limitations, living the salutation all his letters 
bear: �en resistencia y lucha� [in resistance and struggle]. However, since 
911, prison conditions have worsened across the board, especially 
jeopardizing the health, safety and lives of our political prisoners. A 
reporter with extensive experience covering U.S. prisons and jails, 
remarking on the revelations of torture in Abu Ghraib, said, �the images 
from Iraq looked all too American to me,� noting similar patterns of 
physical and psychological abuse in the atmosphere of increasing 
militarization of imprisonment in the U.S. We must therefore be vigilant of 
his human rights while we make every effort to achieve his and Carlos 
Alberto�s release.

Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!

History has shown us that the power of the people, active and in motion, 
frees political prisoners. It was our united cry for freedom, international 
support and consistent national work for more than three decades that 
pressured President Carter to free the 4 Nationalist Political Prisoners in 
1978 and President Clinton to grant clemency to 12 of the Puerto Rican 
Political Prisoners in 1999.  Today, however, three Puerto Rican Political 
Prisoners, Haydee Beltran, Oscar Lopez Rivera, and Carlos Alberto Torres 
remain in U.S. jails serving punitive and excessive sentences for fighting 
for the independence and self-determination of Puerto Rico; a colony of the 
United States since 1898.  Adding your voice to the cry for freedom, justice 
and human rights now can insure that our call will be heard once again and 
will make an important contribution to obtaining justice for these freedom 
fighters.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign makes a call to all people who love freedom 
and justice to take up the challenge presented by �Millions for the Puerto 
Rican Political Prisoners!� Campaign.  Our goal is to re-energize the 
campaign to obtain the unconditional release of the Puerto Rican Political 
Prisoners by collecting one million signatures calling for their 
unconditional release.  In June of 2006, we will present the petitions 
collected to the International Community during the annual hearings of the 
United Nations Special Committee on De-colonization.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling on all freedom and justice 
loving people to support this campaign.  We propose to identify 1000 
organizations and individuals, nationally and internationally, to sponsor 
the campaign and to commit to collecting signatures within their 
organization, community, school, church, etc. Sponsoring organizations and 
individuals will receive a packet with ProLibertad literature and 100 
petitions; each petition has 10 spaces for signatures.  By working with 1000 
organizations, each taking 100 petitions at 10 signatures per page, we will 
reach our goal of Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners.

This campaign will show the international community that the movement to 
free the Puerto Rican Political is alive and thriving.  This campaign will 
allow us to educate, organize and mobilize people throughout the world. You 
can help us make this just goal a reality!  We call upon you to become an 
active part of the �Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners� 
Campaign!

Throughout the coming year ProLibertad will be organizing petition drives, 
community forums and other events to promote the campaign. Organizations and 
individuals will be invited to help in the collection of signatures, the 
dissemination of literature and to support events.  We will encourage 
sponsoring organizations to hold their own activities and initiatives during 
the year and will help to publicize, mobilize and provide support.

All sponsoring organizations and individuals who sign onto this campaign 
will be listed in all the Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners 
Campaign literature and media outreach.

To join our campaign contact us via email ProLibertad@..., or call 
us at Bronx 718-601-4751, Manhattan 212-927-9065, or New Jersey 
201-435-3244.  Send us your address and contact information and we will send 
you the �Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners� Packet and add 
you to our list to keep you updates on campaign developments.

Your organizational or individual donations are also needed to make the 
�Millions for the Puerto Rican Prisoners� Campaign a success. Tax-deductible 
donations may be sent to: IFCO/ProLibertad, 402 West 145th Street, New York, 
New York 10033. Please indicate Millions in 2006 in the memo section of your 
check or money order.

<pre>Thought I should pass on my knowledge to all you guys (and gals) on here. I know like heaps of men I am pretty shy when it comes to going up to someone. I've tried a few different places (clubs, bars, etc) but never seem to have too much luck. Anyway, a couple of weeks ago I joined up to http://www.findyourpartner.info/zubv and I have to say I am already getting excited. I was beginning to think I'd end up being alone for ever, but already been talking to a few interestedladies on there. Anyway, if you're like me it comes highly recommended!

Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!

History has shown us that the power of the people, active and in motion,
frees political prisoners. It was our united cry for freedom, international
support and consistent national work for more than three decades that
pressured President Carter to free the 4 Nationalist Political Prisoners in
1978 and President Clinton to grant clemency to 12 of the Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners in 1999.  Today, however, three Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners, Haydee Beltran, Oscar Lopez Rivera, and Carlos Alberto Torres
remain in U.S. jails serving punitive and excessive sentences for fighting
for the independence and self-determination of Puerto Rico; a colony of the
United States since 1898.  Adding your voice to the cry for freedom, justice
and human rights now can insure that our call will be heard once again and
will make an important contribution to obtaining justice for these freedom
fighters.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign makes a call to all people who love freedom
and justice to take up the challenge presented by �Millions for the Puerto
Rican Political Prisoners!� Campaign.  Our goal is to re-energize the
campaign to obtain the unconditional release of the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners by collecting one million signatures calling for their
unconditional release.  In June of 2006, we will present the petitions
collected to the International Community during the annual hearings of the
United Nations Special Committee on De-colonization.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling on all freedom and justice
loving people to support this campaign.  We propose to identify 1000
organizations and individuals, nationally and internationally, to sponsor
the campaign and to commit to collecting signatures within their
organization, community, school, church, etc. Sponsoring organizations and
individuals will receive a packet with ProLibertad literature and 100

Victory for the former Puerto Rican political prisoners  Most ex-prisoners 
have parole restrictions terminated

By Jan Susler, Posted Tuesday, August 2, 2005

On Tuesday, July 26, 2005, the United States Parole Commission issued 
rulings terminating supervision for Edwin Cort�s, Elizam Escobar, Ricardo 
Jim�nez, Adolfo Matos, Dylcia Pag�n, Alberto Rodr�guez, and Alejandrina 
Torres. After 16 and 20 years in prison, followed by five years and 10 
months of successful integration into civil society, they can now live their 
lives without government restriction. Not so for Lucy Rodr�guez and Carmen 
Valent�n. As for Carmen Valent�n, the commission is sending her case back 
for another hearing based on tardy and irrelevant input from the FBI. As for 
Lucy Rodr�guez, the commission erroneously interpreted her absence from her 
hearing as a waiver of consideration of her case. We will work to ensure 
that their supervision is likewise terminated.

The Parole Commission's ruling comes as the result of three days of hearings 
in February, during which evidence demonstrated that the former political 
prisoners are highly respected members of the society whose lives and 
careers were adversely affected by the illogical and unjust restrictions of 
supervision. In addition to evidence that the FBI closed its investigation 
of the FALN in June of 2004, the probation officers who supervised the nine 
testified that there is no ongoing law enforcement investigation, and that 
all nine were leading productive and law abiding lives since the 1999 
presidential commutation of their sentences. Leading the evidence to support 
termination of supervision was a letter from the Governor of Puerto Rico, 
An�bal Acevedo Vil�, who said, "As expressed to Chairman Reilly from the 
[Parole] Commission on August 2004, as Resident Commissioner in Washington I 
felt then, as I do now as Governor, that the above mentioned prisoners 
should not be subjected to supervision as part of the commutation of their 
sentences. The productive lives they have led since their release speaks for 
itself." Other testimony came from all four Puerto Rican members of 
Congress: Jose Serrano, Luis Gutierrez, Nydia Velazquez, and Luis Fortuno, 
as well as from leaders of civil society included Julio Fontanet, President 
of the Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rican Bar Association) and 
Rev. Heriberto Mart�nez, President of the Concilio de Iglesias (National 
Council of Churches). The Commission also heard from other prominent 
spokespeople such as Dr. Teresa Ti�, Executive Director of the Puerto Rican 
Institute of Culture; Dr. Marimar Ben�tez, Chancellor of the Puerto Rican 
School of Fine Arts; and other academic, business and community leaders.

The former prisoners will continue to live their lives committed to the 
independence of their country, caring for their parents, children and 
grandchildren; supporting themselves; and contributing to the betterment of 
society, without the intrusion and restrictions of supervision. Appreciative 
of the support they have always received from the Puerto Rican people and 
other human rights advocates, they urge their supporters to work for the 
release of the remaining Puerto Rican political prisoners Oscar Lopez Rivera 
and Carlos Alberto Torres.

Prisoners, Haydee Beltran, Oscar Lopez Rivera, and Carlos Alberto Torres
remain in U.S. jails serving punitive and excessive sentences for fighting
for the independence and self-determination of Puerto Rico; a colony of the
United States since 1898.  Adding your voice to the cry for freedom, justice
and human rights now can insure that our call will be heard once again and
will make an important contribution to obtaining justice for these freedom
fighters.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign makes a call to all people who love freedom
and justice to take up the challenge presented by �Millions for the Puerto
Rican Political Prisoners!� Campaign.  Our goal is to re-energize the
campaign to obtain the unconditional release of the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners by collecting one million signatures calling for their
unconditional release.  In June of 2006, we will present the petitions
collected to the International Community during the annual hearings of the
United Nations Special Committee on De-colonization.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling on all freedom and justice
loving people to support this campaign.  We propose to identify 1000
organizations and individuals, nationally and internationally, to sponsor
the campaign and to commit to collecting signatures within their
organization, community, school, church, etc. Sponsoring organizations and
individuals will receive a packet with ProLibertad literature and 100
petitions; each petition has 10 spaces for signatures.  By working with 1000
organizations, each taking 100 petitions at 10 signatures per page, we will
reach our goal of Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners.

This campaign will show the international community that the movement to
free the Puerto Rican Political is alive and thriving.  This campaign will
allow us to educate, organize and mobilize people throughout the world. You
can help us make this just goal a reality!  We call upon you to become an
active part of the �Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners�
Campaign!

Throughout the coming year ProLibertad will be organizing petition drives,
community forums and other events to promote the campaign. Organizations and
individuals will be invited to help in the collection of signatures, the
dissemination of literature and to support events.  We will encourage
sponsoring organizations to hold their own activities and initiatives during
the year and will help to publicize, mobilize and provide support.

All sponsoring organizations and individuals who sign onto this campaign
will be listed in all the Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners
Campaign literature and media outreach.

To join our campaign contact us via email ProLibertad@..., or call
us at Bronx 718-601-4751, Manhattan 212-927-9065, or New Jersey
201-435-3244.  Send us your address and contact information and we will send

you to our list to keep you updates on campaign developments.

Announcement from the National Committee to Free the Cuban Five
Today, August 9, after more than one year of weighing the
evidence, the 11th Circuit Court of a Appeals vacated the
trial court's ruling against the Cuban Five and ordered a
new trial with a change of venue. This is a sensational
victory for the Five, the Cuban people, and the
international people's movement that supports them! The
Five will now receive a new trial in a place other than
Miami. This blow to the U.S. government undeniably was made
possible by the hard work and growing support of
progressive, justice-loving people in the U.S. and all over
the world.

The National Committee to Free the Cuban Five is holding a
telephone press conference today with the Five's attorney,
Leonard Weinglass, the coordinator of the National
Committee to Free the Cuban Five, Gloria La Riva,
A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition Coordinator, Brian Becker, and other
activists and legal experts to discuss this landmark
victory. We will send more information as soon as we have
it. In the meantime, call 323-464-1636 with questions.
The Five are one big step closer to freedom. Let's continue
the struggle and ensure total victory. Free the Cuban Five!
U.S. Hands Off Cuba!

Volver�n! They will return!

National Committee to Free the Cuban Five
For more info call 323-464-1636 or e-mail freethefivela@....

The convictions of the Cuban Five have been overturned
by the federal appellate court in Atlanta, Georgia.
The request for change of venue has been granted and
the case is being sent back for retrial OUTSIDE MIAMI.
This is what the defense campaign has always sought
There will be a news conference in San Francisco
at the offices of FREE THE FIVE at 10:00 AM today

.
Speakers:
Gloria LaRiva, Free The Five
Leonard Weinglass, Attorney for Gerardo Hernandez
Richard Klugh, Attorney from Public Defenders Office
Miami, Florida.

More details as soon as we have them.
NOTE THIS FROM ATTORNEY LEONARD WEINGLASS
During the trial, the attorneys for the Five requested a
change of venue from Miami to another city five times. The
judge denied each request. In December 2001, two of the
Five were sentenced to life in prison, one to 19 years, and
one, to 15 years. Gerardo Hernandez received two life
terms.

Why is it not possible for Cuban nationals like the
Five to receive a fair trial in Miami ? What role do
anti-Cuban terrorists play?

Miami is the one city in the US where the Five
certainly could not receive a fair trial. There are
approximately 650,000 Cubans who live there in exile.
They control the local press and the media, they occupy the
public offices, and they are the major business figures in
the area. These individuals and institutions are highly
influential, and they all have one thing in common: they
take a hard line on Cuba . Miami is a different place than
every other city in the US . A portion of the exile
community has engaged in terrorism against Cuba for
decades. Violence against Cuba is heralded in small, but
vocal, circles in Miami .

For instance, in Miami , the
terrorist Orlando Bosch walks the streets a free man. The
US Justice Department once labeled Bosch the most dangerous
terrorist in the Western Hemisphere . He was responsible
for bombing a Cuban passenger airline in mid-flight in
1976, killing all 73 passengers on board. Hard-line exiles
and their supporters play a large role in shaping public
opinion and debate in Miami . To try the Five in Miami was
a clear violation of their right to have a trial free of
outside influences that were prejudiced against them. The
venue of the trial should have been moved out of Miami to
another location.

Basically you join their chat-room on their site it gives you a link to those people online in the chat-room, their location, their picture, etc and at one click you can start chatting to them over Webcam (even if you don't have one). Pretty nifty stuff I think!

Washington's decades-long effort to overthrow the Revolution in
Cuba has suffered a powerful defeat in the ruling of the Atlanta
federal appellate court throwing out the convictions of the Five.
Alarc�n advises Washington to cut its losses by freeing them now.
The authoritative nature of the court's judgement flows from its
conservative nature as a bastion of the political establishment.

("In no way is the finding a consequence of any action against the
United States by the Cuban government. The judges who analyzed the
case are not agents of our country, or revolutionaries, or
sympathizers with the Cuban Revolution. In the document that they
presented in an elegant language, they define their distance in
relation to Cuba," Alarcon explains.

Ricardo Alarc�n: if the Five have a retrial, it will turn into a
Nuremberg for the U.S.

� Reiterates in a press conference that in line with the Atlanta
Court ruling, they should be released immediately

BY MARIA JULIA MAYORAL
Granma daily special correspondents

CARACAS, August 11.�Ricardo Alarc�n, president of the National
Assembly of People�s Power, today asked participants in the 16th
World Festival of Youth and Students to raise their voices to demand
the immediate and unconditional release of the five Cuban heroes,
anti-terrorist fighters kidnapped by the U.S. government.

Antonio Guerrero, Fernando Gonz�lez, Gerardo Hern�ndez, Ram�n
Laba�ino and Ren� Gonz�lez never committed the crimes for which they
were imprisoned in the United States seven years ago, and now that
truth has been recognized by the three judges appointed by the
Eleventh Circuit Atlanta Court of Appeals to review the case.

�On August 9 the judges publicly announced their unanimous decision
to overturn the sentences and order a retrial for our compatriots,
who have the right to an impartial trial in a non-hostile atmosphere.
However, the Five are still incarcerated in maximum-security prisons.
What we would like is for the fullest, most generous and most
vigorous will to emerge from this Festival so that the Washington
authorities know that many people in the world know that they are
holding kidnapped five anti-terrorist combatants; that the U.S.
General Attorney�s Office is flooded with letters, faxes, emails,
phone calls and communications of every type demanding the release of
Antonio, Ren�, Gerardo, Fernando and Ram�n.�

�Their immediate release must be the main consequence of the historic
step taken by the Atlanta judges, whose ruling � totally adhering to
the Constitution and other laws of that country � was demonstrative
of the dignity, decorum and professionalism of the three judges, who
merit all our respect.

�The decision of this court,� he indicated, �is the result of the
efforts of a group of U.S. lawyers, and the solidarity of numerous
people, many of them incorporated into solidarity groups has also had
weight in that.

�In no way is the finding a consequence of any action against the
United States by the Cuban government. The judges who analyzed the
case are not agents of our country, or revolutionaries, or
sympathizers with the Cuban Revolution. In the document that they
presented in an elegant language, they define their distance in
relation to Cuba,� Alarc�n noted, going on to point out that the
Miami mafia is already accusing and insulting those professionals,
believing that they have a favorable position towards Cuba.

�Our compatriots,� he recalled, �were fighting against terrorist
groups openly operating in Miami, with the indulgence, support and
protection of the U.S. government. Thus the case of the Five is
closely related to the backing given by Washington to terrorists like
Luis Posada Carriles. One of the merits of the Atlanta Court of
Appeals document is precisely to include an account of acts of
terrorism against Cuba, among them those executed by Posada Carriles.

The president of the Cuban Parliament explained that the U.S.
Attorney in Florida has just informed the Miami Herald that they are
considering a retrial for the Five next year. "Let�s see if they
dare, because now it is going to be very hard to prevent a lot of
interest in that trial, which could turn into a kind of Nuremberg for
the fascist government of the United States, its terrorists and their
buddies,� commented Alarc�n.

Coining Gerardo�s expression on the finding of the Atlanta Court of
Appeals, the parliamentary leader said that it could be concluded
that the ball is in the White House field and our hit is going to be
a homerun with bases full with the first pitch.

Alarc�n was speaking in the Festival�s international press center
based in the Arauco Suites Hotel. The mothers and wives of the Five
likewise participated in the meeting and responded to journalists�
questions.

*****************************************************************************

Washington's decades-long effort to overthrow the Revolution in
Cuba has suffered a powerful defeat in the ruling of the Atlanta
federal appellate court throwing out the convictions of the Five.
Alarc�n advises Washington to cut its losses by freeing them now.
The authoritative nature of the court's judgement flows from its
conservative nature as a bastion of the political establishment.

("In no way is the finding a consequence of any action against the
United States by the Cuban government. The judges who analyzed the
case are not agents of our country, or revolutionaries, or
sympathizers with the Cuban Revolution. In the document that they
presented in an elegant language, they define their distance in

This is a message from Prensa Latina, August 17, from Ram�n Laba�ino

Ramon Laba�ino, one of the Five anti-terrorist Cubans unjustly
imprisoned in the United States, sent a message of appreciation to
the Cuban people and friends around the world for their solidarity,
after the positive decision of the Court of Appeals.

To all the brothers and sisters who in one way or another have
helped in the cause of the Five: Congratulations, because this has
been a triumph of justice, but of solidarity as well, said Laba�ino
in his message published in the Rebel Youth (Juventud Rebelde)
newspaper.

The past August 9, the Court of Appeals of Atlanta overturned the
sentences that weighed upon him and his comrades Gerardo Hern�ndez,
Antonio Guerrero, Fernando Gonz�lez and Ren� Gonz�lez, in prison
since 1998.

The judges who revised the case also ordered a new trial outside of
Miami, bastion of the Cuban counterrevolution abroad.

The Atlanta decision was preceded by a decision of a group of
experts from the United Nations, which recognized the illegality of
the detentions and the trial, which followed in the city of Miami,
as they are also known, and it called for remedies to the case.

"These are now two big blows for those who are trying to keep us
imprisoned, that from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions of
the UN, which was categorical in its conclusion, and now the 11th
Circuit gave its verdict," said Laba�ino, who [was] sentenced to
life plus 18 years.

In spite of never losing his hope, the economist feels more
optimistic than ever especially after reading the 93 pages of the
judges' decision and he notes how sweeping was their response,
explained his wife Elizabeth Palmeiro, after a short visit with him
in the prison. It is very difficult to appeal something so well
argued o full of ethics, as he told his wife during their visit.

He also said that they "were certain that outside of Miami the
outcome would be different and Atlanta is the proof."


Members of the National Committee to Free the Cuban Five visited
Gerardo Hernandez

On Saturday August 20, we visited Gerardo Hernandez at the U.S.
Penitentiary in Adelanto California. We found him to be in good
spirits with his usual sincerity and sense of humor.  Gerardo of
course is closely following the new developments in their case and
is cautiously optimistic about the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
ruling that was issued on August 9.

On behalf of the Cuban 5, Gerardo sends from the prison his warmest
regards to all of the Cuban solidarity activists in the United
States and around the world who have been working so hard on the
case of the Five. He told us, "It would not have been the same
without the support we have received from groups and individuals who
have been instrumental in raising awareness of the injustice of our
incarceration"

Because of a dramatic increase in the amount of mail Gerardo is
receiving, particularly after this latest development in the case,
he wants everyone to know how deeply he appreciates this out pouring
of support. He told us to let you know that it would be difficult to
respond to each of you on an individual basis at this time.

While the recent ruling of the court of appeals marks a significant
break in the case of the Cuban Five, Gerardo is conscious that the
struggle for their freedom will not end until the day they all step
back onto Cuban soil. At the end of our visit, he reminded us once
again to send his thanks and solidarity to all of you.

support and consistent national work for more than three decades that
pressured President Carter to free the 4 Nationalist Political Prisoners in
1978 and President Clinton to grant clemency to 12 of the Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners in 1999. Today, however, three Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners, Haydee Beltran, Oscar Lopez Rivera, and Carlos Alberto Torres
remain in U.S. jails serving punitive and excessive sentences for fighting
for the independence and self-determination of Puerto Rico; a colony of the
United States since 1898. Adding your voice to the cry for freedom, justice
and human rights now can insure that our call will be heard once again and
will make an important contribution to obtaining justice for these freedom
fighters.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign makes a call to all people who love freedom
and justice to take up the challenge presented by �Millions for the Puerto
Rican Political Prisoners!� Campaign. Our goal is to re-energize the
campaign to obtain the unconditional release of the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners by collecting one million signatures calling for their
unconditional release. In June of 2006, we will present the petitions
collected to the International Community during the annual hearings of the
United Nations Special Committee on De-colonization.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling on all freedom and justice
loving people to support this campaign. We propose to identify 1000
organizations and individuals, nationally and internationally, to sponsor
the campaign and to commit to collecting signatures within their
organization, community, school, church, etc. Sponsoring organizations and
individuals will receive a packet with ProLibertad literature and 100
petitions; each petition has 10 spaces for signatures. By working with 1000
organizations, each taking 100 petitions at 10 signatures per page, we will
reach our goal of Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners.

This campaign will show the international community that the movement to
free the Puerto Rican Political is alive and thriving. This campaign will
allow us to educate, organize and mobilize people throughout the world. You
can help us make this just goal a reality! We call upon you to become an
active part of the �Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners�
Campaign!

Throughout the coming year ProLibertad will be organizing petition drives,
community forums and other events to promote the campaign. Organizations and
individuals will be invited to help in the collection of signatures, the
dissemination of literature and to support events. We will encourage
sponsoring organizations to hold their own activities and initiatives during
the year and will help to publicize, mobilize and provide support.

All sponsoring organizations and individuals who sign onto this campaign
will be listed in all the Millions for the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners
Campaign literature and media outreach.

DENOUNCE THE ASSASSINATION OF FILIBERTO OJEDA RIOS!!

MONDAY SEPT. 26TH, AT 5PM
PROTEST AT 26 FEDERAL PLAZA
(Subway: 4, 5, 6, J, M to Brooklyn Bridge; A, C, E to Chambers St.; R, N to 
Canal St)

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling on all our allies and supporters 
of justice to join us on Monday Sept. 26th at 5pm at 26 Federal Plaza to 
denounce the assassination of Puerto Rican revolutionary leader Filiberto 
Ojeda Rios, leader of the clandestine revolutionary organization called El 
Ejercito Popular Boricua-Macheteros (The Popular Boricua Army-Machete 
Wielders)!!

On Friday Sept. 23rd, in a massive Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) 
operation in the town of Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, Filiberto Ojeda Rios, 
leader of the clandestine revolutionary organization called El Ejercito 
Popular Boricua-Macheteros (The Popular Boricua Army-Machete Wielders) was 
assassinated by an FBI sniper.

During the ensuing gun battle, Beatriz Rosado Barbosa, Ojeda Rios� wife, was 
critically wounded and then arrested, along with an F.B.I. agent. Both are 
presently hospitalized, and a third man has yet to be identified by 
authorities.

This assassination is an attack against the Puerto Rican Independence 
movement that cannot go unanswered!!  We must mobilize and organize a 
response to this heinous act of murder. Ojeda Rios represented the 
revolutionary spirit and morality of the Puerto Rican independence 
movement!!

The FBI chose to assassinate Ojeda Rios on Friday Sept. 23rd (Known as  El 
Grito de Lares, a celebration of the anti-colonial resistance movement in 
Puerto Rico) as a message to the independence movement; the US government is 
trying to tell us that if we resist, then we will be murdered like Ojeda 
Rios, Don Pedro Albizu Campos, Angel Rodrgiuez Cristobal and the many other 
Puerto Rican patriots that have fallen at the hands of the US governement.

We will not be scared or initmidated.  The power of the people cannot be 
stopped!!  We make freedom happen; we make liberation happen!!

WE WILL RISE, RESIST AND REBEL!!  Join us in our outrage, mourning and 
resistance!!  Wear a black arm band, wear all black, bring your niose 
makers, your flags and your 25 closest friends to the protest!!  MOBILIZE IN

WIFE OF ASSASSINATED PUERTO RICAN LEADER FILIBERTO OJEDA RIOS IN FEDRAL 
PENITENTIARY IN PUERTO RICO; FBI READY TO ARRESTS 125 ALLEGED MACHETERO 
SUPPORTERS

Saturday September 24, 2005, New York, NY-The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign 
denounces the incarceration of Beatriz Rosado Barbosa, who is now the 6th 
PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER incarcerated in U.S. jails.  Beatriz Rosado 
Barbosa, wife of assassinated Machetero leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios, was 
injured yesterday during the gun battle in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico that 
took Ojeda Rios' life.  Rosado Barbosa is incarcerated in the federal prison 
in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.

As of yet, there are no charges lobbied against her; Rosado Barbos is 
presently being supported by thousands of Puerto Rican activists, community 
members, and clergy outside of the federal penitentiary.

According to Puerto Rican news sources, the FBI has begun to write out 
arrests order for 125 people suspected of being Machetero supporters. The 
FBI is attempting another set of mass arrests; similar to the arrests that 
took place in Puerto Rico in April 1985 when nearly 400 FBI agents invaded 
Puerto Rico arresting any person they thought was a Machetero or who might 
be a supporter of the Macheteros.  Those arrests were an attempt to destroy 
the clandestine revolutionary movement and to send a clear message to all 
independentistas; if you resist, you will be arrested.

This new "independentista witchhunt" will not intimidate or detour the work 
to free the Puerto Rican political prisoners, attain the 4 demands of the 
people of Vieques, and the liberation of Puerto Rico.  The Puerto Rican 
people have been organizing protests, vigils and pickets throughout the 
island in the spirit and in honor of Ojeda Rios.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling a PROTEST ON MONDAY SEPT. 26TH 
AT 5PM AT 26 FEDERAL PLAZA to denounce the assassination of Ojeda Rios, the 
incarceration of Rosado barbosa and this new wave of repression agains tthe 
Puerto Rican indpendence movement!!

Slain Puerto Rican Rebel Didn�t Have To Die
Juan Gonzalez
NY Daily News
Thursday, October 6, 2005

A former naval intelligence officer says he knows for a fact that Puerto 
Rican nationalist fugitive Filiberto Ojeda Rios didn�t have to die in a 
shootout with the FBI.

He says he knows this because he told FBI agents a year ago where they could 
find Ojeda � even telling them where he liked to eat.

�What they did was an injustice,�  the former Navy officer told me last 
week.  �No matter what Ojeda did, he was still a human being . . . . They 
could easily have taken him alive.�

The informant, who asked not to be identified, has given his full account to 
the Justice Department�s Inspector General�s Office, which opened an 
independent review of the shooting last week.

FBI Director Robert Mueller requested the review after top officials from 
the island�s various political parties, including pro-commonwealth Gov. 
Anibal Acevedo Vil�, and several members of New York�s congressional 
delegation publicly criticized the FBI�s handling of the incident.

And yesterday the Puerto Rican commonwealth�s own Department of Justice 
subpoenaed weapons and records of the FBI�s operation.

By the time of his death, 72-year-old Ojeda, a onetime musician turned 
revolutionary, had become a legendary figure on the island.

A founder of the militant pro-independence group called the Macheteros, he 
had been on the run since 1990 for his role in a $7 million Wells Fargo 
armed robbery in Hartford in 1983.

During all those years, Ojeda frequently gave interviews to Puerto Rican 
reporters, routinely disseminated pro-independence proclamations, and was 
even spotted at times at protest marches.

Despite a reward on his head that reached $1.1 million, he popped up so 
often in public that Puerto Ricans openly joked about the FBI�s apparent 
inability to find him.

But on the afternoon of Sept. 23, a special team of agents dispatched from 
the United States surrounded Ojeda�s farmhouse hideout in Hormigueros, a 
small town near the island�s western coast.

According to the official version, Ojeda opened fire from inside while 
agents moved in to arrest him.  One agent was wounded and Ojeda was shot 
beneath the clavicle in the initial shootout.

The fugitive�s wife, who was with him at the time, surrendered immediately.  
She later claimed the agents opened fire without warning and that her 
husband offered to give up in the presence of well-known Puerto Rican 
journalist Jesus Davila, but agents refused.

Over the next 20 hours, the FBI team sealed off the area and would not allow 
Puerto Rican police near the scene.  By the time they entered the house the 
next day, Ojeda had bled to death.

The long delay, officials say, was caused by waiting for bomb detection 
units to arrive and check for possible booby-trap.

But even those who oppose Ojeda�s  radical views and methods aren�t buying 
that account.

Many are especially furious at the timing of the operation.

Sept. 23 is the anniversary of El Grito de Lares, Puerto Rico�s failed 1868 
independence revolt against Spanish colonialism.  It is a date commemorated 
each year by the independence movement with a march to the town of Lares.

At the very moment federal agents were moving in on Ojeda�s hideout, a taped 
speech of his was being played at the Lares event.

�I�m a statehooder, but I see the FBI was trying to humiliate all Puerto 
Ricans by going after him on El Grito de Lares,� says the former naval 
officer who provided the agents information.  �I feel I was used.�

In early 2004, he claims, he and two of his friends met with FBI agents 
several times.  The told the agents that Ojeda was living in Hormigueros, 
and that the fugitive often ate at El Conejo Blanco, a well-known restaurant 
in Hormigueros popular with independence supporters.

�All they had to do was set up surveillance at the restaurant and they could 
have picked him up,� the informant says.

He says he also identified other spots on the island that Ojeda frequented.

�I wanted him arrested, not killed,� he said.

But when the agents failed to act by early this year, he says, he broke off 
contact and stopped offering any more information.

�I didn�t do it for the money, and never received a penny,� he insists.

When I called FBI headquarters in Washington, they referred all my questions 
to the San Juan field office, but agents there did not return several calls 
for comment.

Meanwhile, press reports in San Juan claim federal officials have begun to 
pay out part of the $1.1 million reward for Ojeda to two informants.

Slain Puerto Rican Rebel Didn�t Have To Die
Juan Gonzalez
NY Daily News
Thursday, October 6, 2005

A former naval intelligence officer says he knows for a fact that Puerto 
Rican nationalist fugitive Filiberto Ojeda Rios didn�t have to die in a 
shootout with the FBI.

He says he knows this because he told FBI agents a year ago where they could 
find Ojeda � even telling them where he liked to eat.

�What they did was an injustice,�  the former Navy officer told me last 
week.  �No matter what Ojeda did, he was still a human being . . . . They 
could easily have taken him alive.�

The informant, who asked not to be identified, has given his full account to 
the Justice Department�s Inspector General�s Office, which opened an 
independent review of the shooting last week.

FBI Director Robert Mueller requested the review after top officials from 
the island�s various political parties, including pro-commonwealth Gov. 
Anibal Acevedo Vil�, and several members of New York�s congressional 
delegation publicly criticized the FBI�s handling of the incident.

And yesterday the Puerto Rican commonwealth�s own Department of Justice 
subpoenaed weapons and records of the FBI�s operation.

By the time of his death, 72-year-old Ojeda, a onetime musician turned 
revolutionary, had become a legendary figure on the island.

A founder of the militant pro-independence group called the Macheteros, he 
had been on the run since 1990 for his role in a $7 million Wells Fargo 
armed robbery in Hartford in 1983.

During all those years, Ojeda frequently gave interviews to Puerto Rican 
reporters, routinely disseminated pro-independence proclamations, and was 
even spotted at times at protest marches.

Despite a reward on his head that reached $1.1 million, he popped up so 
often in public that Puerto Ricans openly joked about the FBI�s apparent 
inability to find him.

But on the afternoon of Sept. 23, a special team of agents dispatched from 
the United States surrounded Ojeda�s farmhouse hideout in Hormigueros, a 
small town near the island�s western coast.

According to the official version, Ojeda opened fire from inside while 
agents moved in to arrest him.  One agent was wounded and Ojeda was shot 
beneath the clavicle in the initial shootout.

The fugitive�s wife, who was with him at the time, surrendered immediately.  
She later claimed the agents opened fire without warning and that her 
husband offered to give up in the presence of well-known Puerto Rican 
journalist Jesus Davila, but agents refused.

Over the next 20 hours, the FBI team sealed off the area and would not allow 
Puerto Rican police near the scene.  By the time they entered the house the 
next day, Ojeda had bled to death.

The long delay, officials say, was caused by waiting for bomb detection 
units to arrive and check for possible booby-trap.

But even those who oppose Ojeda�s  radical views and methods aren�t buying 
that account.

Many are especially furious at the timing of the operation.

independence revolt against Spanish colonialism.  It is a date commemorated 
each year by the independence movement with a march to the town of Lares.

At the same time that the FBI/U.S. government has assassinated Filiberto 
Ojeda, is trying to arrest Antonio Camacho Negron for no good reason, one of 
our 5 Puerto Rican Political Prisoners is being denied medical treatment for 
a serious ailment.

Vieques Political Prisoner Jose Velez Acosta has been EXTREMELY ILL for 
almost a month.  He has been bleeding profusely from his rectum, feels pain 
in his colon/kidney area, and has lost his appetite.

He has been given various medications, but has not undergone any medical 
examinations.  He has a Colonoscopy scheduled, but has not undergone the 
procedure.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is urging all our allies and supporters to 
download a PDF format copy of the following letter and mail it out to Warden 
Tracy Johns of USP Coleman I and demand that Jose Velez Acosta receive the 
medical attention he deserves!!

The above PDF link is to three articles written in El dario/La Prensa (in 
English) about Antonio Camacho negron adn the ProLibertad picket organized 
on Friday Oct. 14th to denounce the FBI's attempts to arrest him!!

The FBI has issued an arrest warrant for former Puerto Rican Political 
Prisoner Antonio Camacho Negron, arrested for being a part of the MACHETEROS 
in the late 1980s.

The following is a statement that Antonio Camacho Negron wrote and asked 
that
ProLibertad read at the Oct. 14th picket:

The allegation that the FBI has a warrant for my arrest for failure to serve 
15 more years in federal prison is false. It is a total fabrication. The FBI 
is interested in sequestering me for information that I have gathered 
surrounding Filiberto�s death, and have approached my family with this lie 
in the hopes that they will disclose my whereabouts.

I am not �hiding�. I am , of course, being cautious, but I am using my cell 
phone, communicating with friends and family members, and still 
participating in public events. I am accessible. I feel that the FBI will 
make an attempt on my life and justify it with the fabricated lies in 
pursuit of the information I have shared with various elements of the Puerto 
Rican media, as well as to quell the revolutionary spirit that has been 
activated by Filiberto�s death.

The FBI will resort to acts of terrorism against me and others who are 
calling for a full investigation of Filiberto�s death to terrify and silence 
the people from demanding the truth.

Earlier this week, there were allegations by provocateur elements in Puerto 
Rico who have made bold attempts to smear the name and reputation of 
Filiberto�s wife. I believe that the smear tactics are a strategic ploy by 
the federal government to ruin her credibility as a witness to events that 
led to her husband�s assassination. I fully support Filiberto�s wife and 
family and trust the integrity and solidarity that has been instilled in 
each and every member by the late Puerto Rican leader.

I have never been nor will ever be a fugitive from US agencies. I have 
honored his sentence to the fullest extent, and publicly exercises his right 
to express his political and moral views of the colonization of Puerto Rico 
by the United States which have made me one of the targets for censure, 
incarceration, and ultimately assassination.

I am calm and collected, heartened by the reawakened spirit of the Puerto 
Rican people who have truly understood the social and political implications 
of the death of the great patriot Filiberto Ojeda Rios. That statehooders, 
independentistas, and the undecided all understand that Filiberto�s death 
was a political assassination done by the US to demoralize the Puerto Rican 
community, and to quell any and all dissent regarding the liberation of 
Puerto Rico, anti-war beliefs, and other social justice voices that seeks 
dignity, sovereignty, and democracy.

I need the community at large to be vigilant about the conduct of law 
enforcement agents to safeguard my life, and the lives of my friends and 
family members. That the community should demand a thorough investigation on 
Filiberto�s death, and that the process be transparent and secure the human, 
civil, and social rights of Filiberto�s family, friends, and supporters. The 
community must demand that the law enforcement agents and their leadership 
be charged with the crimes that they are guilty of and that they are to be 
punished to the fullest extent of the law.

I love Puerto Rico, and am proud of my people and my heritage, and that I 
will never ever waiver my rights to defend Puerto Rico.

THE CUBAN 5 AND MUMIA ATTHE NYC MARATHON!!

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 is proud to support Angel 
Gonzalez, long time Puerto Rican Activist, who is running the NYC Marathon 
on Sunday Nov. 6th for the FREEDOM OF POLITICAL PRISONER MUMIA ABU JAMAL AND 
THE CUBAN 5!!

We ask that people send pledges to Angel Gonzalez and to join the Popular 
Education Project to
Free the Cuban 5 on Nov. 6th on Sunday Nov. 6th at E116th St. and 1st Ave. 
at a community table to distribute information on the Cuban 5 and Mumia Abu 
jamal!!

JOIN US AS WE MAKE THE NYC MARATHON 2005 ALL ABOUT POLITICAL PRISONERS!!

A statement fromm Angel Gonzalez:

Let me hear from you, Familia y Amigos:

On Nov. 6, I am running the New York City Marathon.  I will run to raise 
awareness about Mumia Abu-Jamal and the Cuban 5.  They are six political 
prisoners, who suffer unjustly in US jails and desperately need our support.

Mumia is a renowned African-American activist and journalist who was been 
jailed since 1981 for allegedly shooting a police officer.  Evidence points 
to his innocence and to racist manipulations throughout his trial.  We 
cannot allow our political leader to remain in jail!  Mumia must not be 
executed. Join the broad international movement calling for Mumia's freedom. 
  Please read more at www.mumia.com .

The Cuban 5 have been unjustly jailed in the US since 1998.  The Cuban 5 
worked to expose Cuban Miami-based terrorist organizations by documenting 
their plots to bomb places in Cuba and other countries. The Miami-based 
terrorist groups in the past have killed and injured hundreds with 
explosives in hotels and planes.  The US government has refused to prosecute 
those exposed Miami terrorists and instead has protected those terrorists!  
For their heroic work, the Cuban 5  were ironically persecuted and were 
jailed for the outrageous charge of "espionage conspiracy".  This past 
August, the Cuban 5 won an appeal for a new trial, BUT they still remain in 
jail and continue to be cruely denied visits from their family members. The 
Cuban 5 must be freed. Please read more at www.freethecuban5.com .

You can help Free Mumia and Free the Cuban 5 by pledging for my marathon 
run. Your check can be made out to either of these support organizations:

For Mumia, checks are made out to "NBUF" with a memo saying for "Mumia 
Organizing".
For the Cuban 5, checks are made out to "IFCO/The Popular Education 
Project".
Checks written in my name will be divided evenly between these 
organizations.

Send your pledges to me at:
Angel F. Gonzalez
3977 Sedgwick Avenue #18 C
Bronx, New York   10463

The training has been rough ... BUT ... for this important cause, I will try 
to go the extra mile.  (At 53 years, it ain't easy!)

With your pledge, you can help carry me across the finish line.  Your 
generosity will help to promote my t-shirt message, FREE MUMIA &amp; FREE THE 
CUBAN 5, throughout the 26 miles in New York City and among thousands on 
November 6.

Thank you.

Para la justicia y la libertad,
Angel F. Gonzalez

THE CUBAN 5 AND MUMIA ATTHE NYC MARATHON!!

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 is proud to support Angel
Gonzalez, long time Puerto Rican Activist, who is running the NYC Marathon
on Sunday Nov. 6th for the FREEDOM OF POLITICAL PRISONER MUMIA ABU JAMAL AND
THE CUBAN 5!!

We ask that people send pledges to Angel Gonzalez and to join the Popular
Education Project to
Free the Cuban 5 on Nov. 6th on Sunday Nov. 6th at E116th St. and 1st Ave.
at a community table to distribute information on the Cuban 5 and Mumia Abu
jamal!!

JOIN US AS WE MAKE THE NYC MARATHON 2005 ALL ABOUT POLITICAL PRISONERS!!

A statement fromm Angel Gonzalez:

Let me hear from you, Familia y Amigos:

On Nov. 6, I am running the New York City Marathon.  I will run to raise
awareness about Mumia Abu-Jamal and the Cuban 5.  They are six political
prisoners, who suffer unjustly in US jails and desperately need our support.

Mumia is a renowned African-American activist and journalist who was been
jailed since 1981 for allegedly shooting a police officer.  Evidence points
to his innocence and to racist manipulations throughout his trial.  We
cannot allow our political leader to remain in jail!  Mumia must not be
executed. Join the broad international movement calling for Mumia's freedom.
  Please read more at www.mumia.com .

The Cuban 5 have been unjustly jailed in the US since 1998.  The Cuban 5
worked to expose Cuban Miami-based terrorist organizations by documenting
their plots to bomb places in Cuba and other countries. The Miami-based
terrorist groups in the past have killed and injured hundreds with
explosives in hotels and planes.  The US government has refused to prosecute
those exposed Miami terrorists and instead has protected those terrorists!
For their heroic work, the Cuban 5  were ironically persecuted and were
jailed for the outrageous charge of "espionage conspiracy".  This past
August, the Cuban 5 won an appeal for a new trial, BUT they still remain in
jail and continue to be cruely denied visits from their family members. The
Cuban 5 must be freed. Please read more at www.freethecuban5.com .

You can help Free Mumia and Free the Cuban 5 by pledging for my marathon
run. Your check can be made out to either of these support organizations:

For Mumia, checks are made out to "NBUF" with a memo saying for "Mumia
Organizing".
For the Cuban 5, checks are made out to "IFCO/The Popular Education
Project".
Checks written in my name will be divided evenly between these
organizations.

Send your pledges to me at:
Angel F. Gonzalez
3977 Sedgwick Avenue #18 C
Bronx, New York   10463

The training has been rough ... BUT ... for this important cause, I will try
to go the extra mile.  (At 53 years, it ain't easy!)

With your pledge, you can help carry me across the finish line.  Your
generosity will help to promote my t-shirt message, FREE MUMIA &amp; FREE THE
CUBAN 5, throughout the 26 miles in New York City and among thousands on
November 6.

Thank you.

Para la justicia y la libertad,
Angel F. Gonzalez

For Mumia, checks are made out to "NBUF" with a memo saying for "Mumia
Organizing". For the Cuban 5, checks are made out to "IFCO/The Popular 
Education
Project". Checks written in my name will be divided evenly between these
organizations.

Send your pledges to me at:
Angel F. Gonzalez
3977 Sedgwick Avenue #18 C
Bronx, New York   10463

The training has been rough ... BUT ... for this important cause, I will try
to go the extra mile.  (At 53 years, it ain't easy!)

With your pledge, you can help carry me across the finish line.  Your
generosity will help to promote my t-shirt message, FREE MUMIA &amp; FREE THE
CUBAN 5, throughout the 26 miles in New York City and among thousands on
November 6.

Thank you.

Para la justicia y la libertad,
Angel F. Gonzalez

Filiberto Tribute

Ojeda Rios was the Commander of the Boricua Popular Army, better known as 
Los Macheteros and had been living in clandestinity since 1990. On Friday 
September 23rd, a historic day for Puerto Rican independentists and 
nationalists known as El Grito de Lares, the FBI assaulted the home of the 
Ojeda Rios, shooting hundreds of rounds which he answered with ten rounds. 
After three volleys of shots, an FBI sharpshooter apparently shot and 
wounded Ojeda Rios. FBI officials refused to enter the house and refused 
entry to supporters, family, lawyers and local government prosecutors. They 
allowed Ojeda Rios, 72 years old with a pacemaker for his weakened heart, to 
bleed to death from his wound, causing widespread indignation all over 
Puerto Rico.

Political figures from across the spectrum denounced the action and the 
secretive manner in which the FBI handled the action and the FBI has now 
announced what they term an "independent investigation" of the incident. 
What remains to be seen is how independent this investigation will be as it 
is being conducted by the Justice Department.

At this time of renewed repression against the Puerto Rican Independence 
movement, your support is more important than ever!!  IF you were also 
angered by this FBI assassination, wish to show your respect for one of the 
longest serving revolutionaries in this hemisphere, or simply wish to show 
your support for Puerto Rican self-determination, PLEASE COME OUT AND ATTEND 
THIS TRIBUTE!!!!

�Filiberto Ojeda Rios Vive!
�Independencia Para Puerto Rico!

Filiberto Tribute

Ojeda Rios was the Commander of the Boricua Popular Army, better known as 
Los Macheteros and had been living in clandestinity since 1990. On Friday 
September 23rd, a historic day for Puerto Rican independentists and 
nationalists known as El Grito de Lares, the FBI assaulted the home of the 
Ojeda Rios, shooting hundreds of rounds which he answered with ten rounds. 
After three volleys of shots, an FBI sharpshooter apparently shot and 
wounded Ojeda Rios. FBI officials refused to enter the house and refused 
entry to supporters, family, lawyers and local government prosecutors. They 
allowed Ojeda Rios, 72 years old with a pacemaker for his weakened heart, to 
bleed to death from his wound, causing widespread indignation all over 
Puerto Rico.

Political figures from across the spectrum denounced the action and the 
secretive manner in which the FBI handled the action and the FBI has now 
announced what they term an "independent investigation" of the incident. 
What remains to be seen is how independent this investigation will be as it 
is being conducted by the Justice Department.

At this time of renewed repression against the Puerto Rican Independence 
movement, your support is more important than ever!!  IF you were also 
angered by this FBI assassination, wish to show your respect for one of the 
longest serving revolutionaries in this hemisphere, or simply wish to show 
your support for Puerto Rican self-determination, PLEASE COME OUT AND ATTEND 
THIS TRIBUTE!!!!

�Filiberto Ojeda Rios Vive!
�Independencia Para Puerto Rico!

(btwn. Amsterdam Ave. and Broadway)

As the U.S. government continues its terrorist and repressive occupation of

in the U.S.

In the past year, the U.S. government has increased the bounty on Assata 
Shakur and added her name to the domestic terrorist list, has intervened in 
the case of the Cuban 5 in order to undo the decision of the 11th Circuit 
Court for a retrial, and masterminded the political assassination of Puerto 
Rican revolutionary leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios!!

Coalition and the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign for a night of discussion and

5.  Now more than ever our five heroes/comrades/hermanos need our support.

An important message from the National Committee to Free the Cuban Five 
(U.S.):

6 December 2005

Dear Friends of the Cuban Five:

We ask that you read the information below, and then-as soon as possible,
for receipt by January 15-write a letter to the UN Human Rights Commission
under a special "1503 Procedure" mechanism.

The objective of the letter is to urge a serious investigation and positive
resolution by the Human Rights Commission regarding the denial of family
visits by the U.S. government to the Cuban Five and their families,
especially in the case of Olga Salanueva and Adriana Perez.

[Please also send a second letter, on the unjust detention of the Cuban
Five, using the "1503 Procedure." See the left-hand page of
www.freethefive.org for details in the "Working Group on Arbitrary
Detentions' Conclusion" about the Cuban Five. Use the 1503 procedure listed
below to write a letter for the Cuban Five.]

In addition to unjustly imprisoning Gerardo Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero,
Ramon Labanino, Rene Gonzalez and Fernando Gonzalez, the U.S.  government
has treated the families in an arbitrary and cruel manner. On the average,
the wives, mothers and children of the Cuban Five have only been granted one
to two visits per year.

Most egregious has been the permanent denial of entry visas to Adriana
Perez, wife of Gerardo Hernandez, and to Olga Salanueva, wife of Rene
Gonzalez. As a result, Ivette Gonzalez, the seven-year-old daughter of Olga
Salanueva and Rene Gonzalez, is also deprived of the right to see her
father. She is a U.S.-born citizen.

What is the "1503 Procedure?"

The 1503 Procedure is the mechanism whereby individuals can write a letter
regarding Human Rights violations. These letters are examined by a Working
Group that is in turn designated by the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and
Protection of Human Rights. Called the Working Group on Communications, it
meets annually to examine complaints received from individuals and groups
alleging human rights violations.

Your action can make a difference! Remember that in May of 2005, the Working
Group on Arbitrary Detentions made an important finding of unjust detention,
unfair trial and imprisonment, and made recommendation to the U.S.
government for immediate redress. This important decision was the result of
numerous appeals by many individuals around the world on behalf of the Cuban
Five.

Your individual letter for the Right to Family Visits is important today!
The deadline for receipt of the letters under "1503 Procedure" is January
15, 2005.

Be sure and write an INDIVIDUAL letter to the U.N., not a petition with
multiple signatures.  Each person should write their own letter.

You can also read the brochure of the National Committee to Free the Cuban
Five, on the Family Visits issue. It is available on our website, and is a
good background on Olga and Adriana's situation.

Important facts to note in your letter are:

a. Olga Salanueva and Adriana Perez have both been denied an entry visa six
times by U.S.  authorities.

b. There is no other legal recourse in the U.S. for Perez and Salanueva to
appeal the government's denial of their visas, thus there is no other
alternative but an appeal before the Human Rights commission, using 1503
Procedure.

Below are the guidelines for your communication, as described in the UN
regulations:

"What are the criteria for a communication to be accepted for examination?
To decide what communications may be accepted for examination, the
Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has drawn up
rules of procedure (Sub-Commission resolution 1 (XXIV) of 13 August 1971).

In general terms, these rules may be summarized as follows:

No communication will be admitted if it runs counter to the principles of
the Charter of the United Nations or appears to be politically motivated.

A communication will only be admitted if, on consideration, there are
reasonable grounds to believe-also taking into account any replies sent by
the Government concerned-that a consistent pattern of gross and reliably
attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms exists.
Communications may be submitted by individuals or groups who claim to be
victims of human rights violations or who have direct, reliable knowledge of
violations. Anonymous communications are inadmissible as are those based
only on reports in the mass media.

Each communication must describe the facts, the purpose of the petition and
the rights that have been violated. As a rule, communications containing
abusive language or insulting remarks about the State against which the
complaint is directed will not be considered.

Domestic remedies must have been exhausted before a communication is
considered-unless it can be shown convincingly that solutions at the
national level would be ineffective or that they would extend over an
unreasonable length of time."

http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/complaints.htm

Where to send communications:

Communications intended for handling under the "1503" procedure may be
addressed to:

Treaties and Commission Branch

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling on all our allies and supporters 
to join us in wishing Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Oscar Lopez Rivera a 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND HAPPY THREE KINGS!!

On January 6th, 2006, Oscar will be turning 63 years old!!  We encourage all 
freedom-loving people to write to Oscar and let him know that people are 
thinking of him.

Oscar Lopez Rivera
#87651-024
U.S. Penitentiary
P.O. Box 12015
Terre Haute, IN 47801

Oscar Lopez Rivera was born in San Sebastian, Puerto Rico on January 6, 
1943. At the age of 12, he moved to Chicago with his family. He was a 
well-respected community activist and a prominent independence leader for 
many years prior to his arrest. Oscar was one of the founders of the Rafael 
Cancel Miranda High School, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High 
School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was a 
community organizer for the Northwest Community Organization (NCO), ASSPA, 
ASPIRA and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found 
FREE, (a half-way house for convicted drug addicts) and ALAS (an educational 
program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois).

He was active in various community struggles, mainly in the area of health 
care, employment and police brutality. He also participated in the 
development of the Committee to Free the Five Puerto Rican Nationalists. In 
1975, he was forced underground, along with other comrades. He was captured 
on May 29, 1981, after 5 years of being persecuted by the FBI as one of the 
most feared fugitives from US "justice".

Oscar, who has a daughter named Clarissa, is currently serving a 55-year 
sentence for seditious conspiracy and other charges. He was convicted of 
conspiracy to escape along with Jaime Delgado, (a veteran independence 
leader), Dora Garcia, (a prominent community activist) and Kojo 
Bomani-Sababu, a New Afrikan political prisoner.

Oscar was one of 12 Puerto Rican political prisoners offered some form of 
leniency by the Clinton Administration in the fall of 1999. According to the 
Chicago Sun Times, he "declined the president's offer, which still would 
have him left with 10 years to serve on conspiracy to escape charges. Now he 
faces at least 20 more years in prison. His sister, Zenaida Lopez, said he 
turned the offer down because he would be on parole. 'Accepting what they 
are offering him is like prison outside of prison,' she said. Zenaida Lopez 
said her brother 'was in total agreement' with the decision of the 11 others 
to take the conditional clemency." Oscar is presently in prison in Terre 
Haute, Indiana and his release date is 7/27/2027.

Vieques Political Prisoner Jose Velez Acosta is scheduled to be released on 
Jan. 27th, 2006 from prison.  We encourage people to write to Jose as well 
and to wish him a happy and speedy reintegration back into society.

Jose Velez Acosta  #23883-069
Jose Velez Acosta has family in Puerto Rico and the Bronx.  He has three 
daughters who live with their mother in Springfield, Massachusetts. He was

ASSATA SHAKUR, THE CUBAN 5 AND FILIBERTO OJEDA RIOS: State Repression and
Terrorism

Friday January 20th, 2006 at 7pm St. Mary�s Episcopal Church 521 W126th St.
(btwn. Amsterdam Ave. and Broadway)
Take the 1 or 9 train to W125th St. and Broadway

As the U.S. government continues its terrorist and repressive occupation of
Iraq, it has also waged a war against freedom fighters and revolutionaries
in the U.S.

In the past year, the U.S. government has increased the bounty on Assata
Shakur and added her name to the domestic terrorist list, has intervened in
the case of the Cuban 5 in order to undo the decision of the 11th Circuit
Court for a retrial, and masterminded the political assassination of Puerto
Rican revolutionary leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios!!

Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5, Hands off Assata
Coalition and the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign for a night of discussion and
dialogue about U.S. terrorism and repression in our communities.

Program:
Benjamin Ramos, Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5
Frank Velgara, The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign
Desiree Gordon, Hands off Assata Coalition
