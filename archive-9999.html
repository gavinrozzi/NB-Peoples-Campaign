<pre>Admittedly, there is a degree of censorship there,
as well as some harsh criticism.  On the flip side
his complaint is that he did not like your article. . .

Last I checked people who are deemed editors are
allowed to 'censor' things from publications. . .
One might also interpret this censorship as editing.

Further, I've debated about de-subscribing myself
from this list.  As of late it seems to have degraded
into a spam list for things only tangently related
to the campaign.  Should there be a seperate list for
people who want to receive this information?

CENSORSHIP AT NJIT/VECTOR!

	The Editor in Chief and Managing Editor of the only campus newspaper at
NJIT has decided to censor an article of mine for the first issue of this
semester.  This sets a disturbing tone, suggesting that Freedom of Speech is
not guaranteed at NJIT.
	College campuses have long been hotbeds of intellectual debate and
political dissension, playing a historic role for Social Change and claim a
legacy of Civil Rights struggle in the United States.  More directly, this
is Newark��The Brick City�--not some isolated country club on Ivy Hill.
People have been struggling for social justice in Newark for longer than
most of us here have been alive.  The Editors of the Vector need to get hip
to this fact and cut with the sophomoric stunts.  The Vector office is not
their private pizza den, though the paper�s embarrassing lack of substance
in the past might suggest this.  The Managing Editor went as far as
demanding that I not criticize John Messenger (see below), the Vector�s
darling right-wing columnist last year, whose backwards, racist, Dixie-flag
waving trash talk was vehemently defended in the name of Free Speech by the
same paper that now wants to censor my thoughts and words.
	The great irony is that my article was titled �The Students Pen VS the
Master�s Sword,� written on behalf of Architect Peter Eisenman, who, at a
lecture appearance last spring, ordered his audience to put down their pens,
threatening to embarrass any perpetrators with expulsion from the lecture
hall!!!  This is my second year at NJIT, and I�m deeply concerned about
casual attitude some folks seem to have regarding another�s right to form
independent and progressive thought!  I call upon the students to email the
Vector, or stop in on their office on the second floor of the Student
Center, and demand that they stop the censorship &amp; print my article,
word-for-word.  Finally, it is my hope that once we get past the issue of
censorship, we cen get down to a much needed and energetic debate as to the
merits of Peter Eisanman's work, etc.
	IT�S TIME FOR FREE AND INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AT NJIT!

THIS ARTICLE HAS NOT REACHED SOME PEOPLE, BECAUSE OF ERRORS in the
ATTACHMENT.


The Student�s Pen vs. the Master�s Sword


Let�s begin by taking care of some unresolved business.  Last year, the
School of Architecture was graced with the presence of a Newark native and
deconstructivist luminary, Peter Eisenman.  No need for introduction�accept
to relay my first personal encounter with him:  He began his lecture in
Weston Lecture Hall by telling me to put my pen down.  In fact he told us
all to put our pens down, and if anyone didn�t comply he would embarrass
them by ordering them to leave.  Nice.
	I imagine that most people complied because his talk went on uninterrupted,
even when he mentioned that one of his clients is a Franco Spaniard (in
German, that�s called a Nazi) My initial impulse, however, was to tighten my
grip on my pen and hold on for dear life.  I can�t remember if it was
initially an act of resistance or shock.  But regardless, as my indignation
settled into clarity of purpose, my one thought was: the moment somebody
orders you to put down the pen�the mightiest of weapons�you ask them, no
matter who they are or think they are, politely�at first�where they would
like you to stick it.  And then you start writing down his reaction so that
everyone else knows how the story went.
	It was an unspoken test of wills.  Sitting in full view of our orator,
front row, right-of-center, pen in hand, note book in full view, scratching
thoughts down here and there, not to snatch his words out of the air and
claim them as my own (which I guess was his concern)�frankly I don�t find
much practical use for his ideas.   What I was jotting down was the question
that I wanted to raise during the Q&amp;A session.   I you�re wondering, he
didn�t stop the lecture to single me out for exile.  What he did was much
more insidious.  He refused to take my question.  And there�s no doubt that
of all the waving hands, he accidentally missed just mine.
	O.K., Mr. Eisenman, now I will raise my question, this time with the luxury
of preface.
You appeared New Brunswick, NJ, where I was living, a little over a year ago
with a design concept commissioned by the City and sponsored by the Rutgers�
arts school.   It was an inflated student center &amp; 10,000 seat sports arena
for Rutgers University.  The design was a predictably unpredictable sinewy
curvilinear formless form.  Only, it was not set on Rutgers property, but
directly on top of an entire struggling downtown community�sparing the
church�which was already over-stressed by the �revitalization� that
threatened to ethnically cleanse their block next, making way for the return
of the �white-flighters.�  When the morning newspaper came out with a three
page spread on your plan, folks were shocked, dismayed, and nearly up in
arms.  The outrage only subsided when the city bosses distanced themselves
from the concept by claiming that they never intended to build it.  It was
merely a whimsical exploration of intellectual experiment. You seemed
betrayed, and made the case that we, the people, are just not ready for such
a vision.
So my question to you, Mr. Eisenman, is as it was last spring: What is the
architect�s responsibility to the community in which his buildings are to
exist?
I insist on having this addressed, because too often architecture neglects
the very people whose lives are imposed upon by the invisible hand of the
architect.  Mr. Eisenman, it�s not that the people of New Brunswick �didn�t
get it�!  It�s because you apparently didn�t spend the time to get them.   I
believe it is the job of the architect to go down to the community to find
out its needs, its struggles, its desires.  The architect should be a public
servant, not a lord.  There are real people whose real lives exist in that
space between the architect�s imagination and his or her buildings.   Our
work should reflect that.  Try it.

From my pen to you-
Matthew R. Smith, Student
NJ School of Architecture at NJIT
