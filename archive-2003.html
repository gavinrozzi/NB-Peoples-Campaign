http://ProLibertadWeb.Tripod.com/page7.html

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign wishes our allies and supporters, 
nationally and internationally, a Happy New Year of organizing, educating 
and mobilizing in 2003.

As we enter another year of work, victories and opportunities, We in 
ProLibertad, feel it is important for us to remind people that there are 
STILL five Puerto Rican Political Prisoners in U.S. jails.  Imprisoned for 
their actions and politics as freedom fighting revolutionaries, it is 
important to remember the sacrifice they have made for La Patria (The 
Country of Puerto Rico)and do whatever we can to support the movement for 
which they have been incarcerated.

Below are their addresses; we urge you to write to them and to create a 
relationship with them.  It is our letters, post cards and donations of 
money that show the prisoners that we are thinking of them and support our 
National Liberation struggle.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>This July, the 34th contingent of the Venceremos Brigade will spend two 
weeks in Cuba.  As part of a �Travel Challenge,� organized with IFCO/Pastors 
for Peace, Brigadistas will challenge the u.s. blockade on Cuba.  We hope 
that your organization will play a role in this year�s contingent, either by 
sending representatives on the trip and/or supporting our efforts in other 
ways.

On SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8TH FROM 3:00PM-5:00PM, we will be holding an 
informational meeting for all those interested in finding out more.  The 
meeting will be held at 10 Park Terrace East, #1L (A train to 207th St, 1 
train to 215th St).

For more information and to confirm your organization�s attendance, please 
email vbrigade@... or call 212-560-4360.  Individuals with no 
organizational affiliation are also encouraged to attend.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Venceremos Brigade is an anti-imperialist educational project that, 
since 1969, has sent over 8,000 people to Cuba.  A national organization, 
the Brigade brings people together from all over the U.S. for an 
unforgettable, life changing experience.  During trips, brigadistas 
participate in agricultural and/or construction work while also learning 
about Cuba�s revolution, history, and culture.

This year, the Venceremos Brigade has launched a special campaign.  Along 
with IFCO/Pastors for Peace, we are calling upon people across the country 
to join a mass �Travel Challenge.�  Around 75% of the U.S. population, 
including a majority of Cuban Americans, want an end to the travel ban.  
Over the past two years, both houses of Congress have voted not to enforce 
the travel restrictions.  Yet, since Bush became president, harassment of 
travelers to Cuba, both licensed and unlicensed, has greatly increased.  In 
this climate, it is clear that the Cuba solidarity  movement must take a 
stand.

The Venceremos Brigade has always traveled unlicensed in order to make a 
statement against the U.S. blockade on Cuba, an inhumane policy that attacks 
both the island�s sovereignty and its 11 million people.  This July, 
however, brigadistas will make our most open challenge to the U.S. travel 
restrictions.  In order for the �Travel Challenge� to work, a lot of folks 
will have to participate.

The �Travel Challenge� is not the only reason to (re)join the Venceremos 
Brigade now.  The 34th contingent will participate in Cuba�s national 
celebrations for a special July 26th--this year marks the 50th anniversary 
of the attack on the Moncada Garrison.  The trip will have a special 
concentration on Cuba�s elders, as we hope to participate in the renovation 
of la Habana�s �Casas de Ancianos,� and to collect oral histories from some 
of the island�s elder generation.  The program will also include events 
centered around Cuban hip hop, democracy, health care, education, among 
other topics.

San Juan Puerto Rico 00907


                               PRESS RELEASE

Reverend Jos� Alberto Torres of Chicago has a distinction few others can
claim: his wife Alejandrina Torres, his son Carlos Alberto Torres, and 
his(now former) daughter-in-law Hayde� Beltr�n, all went to prison in 
theUnited States for seeking Puerto Rico's independence from the U.S. In 
1999,after serving 16 years, Alejandrina was released when President 
Clintoncommuted the sentences of eleven of Puerto Rico's political 
prisoners,finding their sentences ranging from 35 to 90 years were 
disproportionatelylengthy. Inexplicably, Mr. Clinton left behind Carlos 
Alberto, whose disproportionate 70 year sentence will keep him imprisoned 
until the year 2024.

Upon her release she applied to visit her stepson Carlos Alberto at FCI
Oxford, Wisconsin, to reunite with him and to take Rev. Torres to see their 
son together. While parole authorities supported this family reunion, Oxford 
prison authorities denied the request, in spite of Carlos Alberto's 
exemplary conduct; in spite of the fact that Alejandrina, like all eleven of 
those whose sentences were commuted, had successfully reintegrated into 
civil society; and in spite of their having permitted other former prisoners 
to visit their imprisoned family members.

Now, three years later, Alejandrina continues to work as a mentor in an
alternative high school, to participate in her church and community, and to 
fully comply with the conditions of her parole. And now, three years later, 
Reverend Torres, with cancer raging through his 80 year old body, has again 
been denied this family reunion, the prison having once again turned down 
their modest request to be permitted to share together in the confines of 
the prison visiting room under the watchful eye of prison officials. "It 
would mean so much to Papi," daughter Dr. Catalina Torres stated, "to be 
able to see Mami and Berti (Carlos Alberto) together before he dies."

"Christmas is such an important moment for Puerto Rican families to be
together, and this may well be Rev. Torres' last Christmas," said Rev.
Alfonso Rom�n, of Puerto Rico's Comit� Pro Derechos Humanos (Human Rights 
Committee), whose letter writing campaign aims to convince Oxford and Bureau 
of Prisons officials to allow the family visit.

Joining the campaign will be many of Rev. Torres' friends and colleagues
from the religious community, including Rev. Heriberto Mart�nez,
Evangelical Council of Puerto Rico; Rev. Luis Rosario, Conference 
MinisterUnited Evangelical Church of Puerto Rico, Rev. Miguel Vilar and Rev. 
Cheo Vilar of the Episcopal Church of Puerto Rico; Rev. Nozomi Ikuta of the 
Interfaith Prisoners of Conscience Project. in Cleveland, OH; and Father 
Angel Dar�o Carrero of the Jesuits of Puerto Rico. On Sunday, December 22, 
churches throughout Puerto Rico and the United States will devote their 
services to the Torres family, praying for their reunion.

<pre>This July, the 34th contingent of the Venceremos Brigade will spend two
weeks in Cuba. As part of a �Travel Challenge,� organized with IFCO/Pastors 
for Peace, Brigadistas will challenge the u.s. blockade on Cuba. We hope 
that your organization will play a role in this year�s contingent, either by 
sending representatives on the trip and/or supporting our efforts in other 
ways.

On SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8TH FROM 3:00PM-5:00PM, we will be holding an
informational meeting for all those interested in finding out more. The
meeting will be held at 10 Park Terrace East, #1L (A train to 207th St, 1 
train to 215th St).

For more information and to confirm your organization�s attendance, please 
email vbrigade@... or call 212-560-4360. Individuals with no 
organizational affiliation are also encouraged to attend.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Venceremos Brigade is an anti-imperialist educational project that,
since 1969, has sent over 8,000 people to Cuba. A national organization, the 
Brigade brings people together from all over the U.S. for an unforgettable, 
life changing experience. During trips, brigadistas participate in 
agricultural and/or construction work while also learning about Cuba�s 
revolution, history, and culture.

This year, the Venceremos Brigade has launched a special campaign. Along 
with IFCO/Pastors for Peace, we are calling upon people across the country 
to join a mass �Travel Challenge.� Around 75% of the U.S. population, 
including a majority of Cuban Americans, want an end to the travel ban. Over 
the past two years, both houses of Congress have voted not to enforce the 
travel restrictions. Yet, since Bush became president, harassment of 
travelers to Cuba, both licensed and unlicensed, has greatly increased. In 
this climate, it is clear that the Cuba solidarity movement must take a 
stand.

The Venceremos Brigade has always traveled unlicensed in order to make a 
statement against the U.S. blockade on Cuba, an inhumane policy that attacks 
both the island�s sovereignty and its 11 million people. This July, however, 
brigadistas will make our most open challenge to the U.S. travel 
restrictions. In order for the �Travel Challenge� to work, a lot of folks 
will have to participate.

The �Travel Challenge� is not the only reason to (re)join the Venceremos 
Brigade now. The 34th contingent will participate in Cuba�s national 
celebrations for a special July 26th--this year marks the 50th anniversary 
of the attack on the Moncada Garrison. The trip will have a special 
concentration on Cuba�s elders, as we hope to participate in the renovation 
of la Habana�s �Casas de Ancianos,� and to collect oral histories from some 
of the island�s elder generation. The program will also include events 
centered around Cuban hip hop, democracy, health care, education, among 
other topics.

At the people of color emergency meeting on 1/13, groups met and decided to 
move ahead with a people of color mobilization on 2/15, the International 
Day of Action against the war. A large planning meeting is scheduled for 
Friday, 1/24.

On Monday, 1/20 there will be a pre-planning meeting for those who want to 
put some work into setting up for 1/24. Both meetings will take place at

___________________________________________
February 15, 2003 is the “International Day for Action.” On this day, 
millions around the world will participate in mass protests to demand peace 
and justice. In particular, the people of the world will call for an end to 
the escalating war against Iraq. Because the Bush administration in 
hell-bent on driving the world into state of war, it is vital that 
communities in the US come out strong on this day. New York City is being 
looked to as a site for US-based action on February 15.

An international action in a people-of-color city demands that communities 
of color play a central leadership role on February 15. We have the 
opportunity to show the world that people of color in the United States do 
not support the war.

This is a call for people of color communities to mobilize New York City for 
peace and justice on February 15. Meetings are now being set for planning 
the NYC action. We call on people of color community groups representing 
multiple sectors-- youth, labor, housing, environmental justice, gender and 
sexual rights, international solidarity, political prisoners and the prison 
industrial complex, immigrant rights, racial justice, and the religious 
community (to name
but a few) – to roll out on JANUARY 24 for a large planning meeting where 
we will discuss February 15 activities.

WHAT: People of Color Planning Meeting for February 15
WHEN: Friday, January 24, 2003, 7pm.
WHERE: Community Service Society, 105 East 22nd Street (on the corner of 
Park Ave), 9th Floor.

This initial call-out is initiated by the New York City members of Racial 
Justice 9-11. RJ-911 is a national network of people of color/racial justice 
organizations opposed to the US war program.

Eric Tang (718) 473-6485 x 15, etang@...
or Hany Khalil (718) 439-5662, hanykhalil@...

Why Stopping the War on Iraq is Critical:

Stopping Bush's war on Iraq is important for many reasons--to stop Bush from 
murdering innocent people of color, to defeat the dangerous policy of  
"pre-emptive" wars, to make it harder for Israel to follow through on its 
threats to ethnically cleanse Palestine of its indigenous people, etc.. For 
our movement, it's also important because if we can impose a defeat on Bush 
on this front, it will help us defeat Bush on all fronts in the "War on 
Terrorism." With Bush politically weakened, it will be far easier to end The 
detentions and deportations, to roll back the PATRIOT Act, to shift money 
away from the military and into public services, to make it much harder for 
Bush to unilaterally overthrow other governments across the Third World.

PRESS RELEASE

Reverend Jos� Alberto Torres of Chicago has a distinction few others 
canclaim: his wife Alejandrina Torres, his son Carlos Alberto Torres, and 
his(now former) daughter-in-law Hayde� Beltr�n, all went to prison in 
theUnited States for seeking Puerto Rico's independence from the U.S. In 
1999,after serving 16 years, Alejandrina was released when President 
Clintoncommuted the sentences of eleven of Puerto Rico's political 
prisoners,finding their sentences ranging from 35 to 90 years were 
disproportionatelylengthy. Inexplicably, Mr. Clinton left behind Carlos 
Alberto, whose disproportionate 70 year sentence will keep him imprisoned 
until the year 2024.

Upon her release she applied to visit her stepson Carlos Alberto at 
FCIOxford, Wisconsin, to reunite with him and to take Rev. Torres to see 
their son together. While parole authorities supported this family reunion, 
Oxford prison authorities denied the request, in spite of Carlos Alberto's 
exemplary conduct; in spite of the fact that Alejandrina, like all eleven of 
those whose sentences were commuted, had successfully reintegrated into 
civil society; and in spite of their having permitted other former prisoners 
to visit their imprisoned family members.Now, three years later, Alejandrina 
continues to work as a mentor in analternative high school, to participate 
in her church and community, and to fully comply with the conditions of her 
parole. And now, three years later, Reverend Torres, with cancer raging 
through his 80 year old body, has again been denied this family reunion, the 
prison having once again turned down their modest request to be permitted to 
share together in the confines of the prison visiting room under the 
watchful eye of prison officials. "It would mean so much to Papi," daughter 
Dr. Catalina Torres stated, "to be able to see Mami and Berti (Carlos 
Alberto) together before he dies.""Christmas is such an important moment for 
Puerto Rican families to betogether, and this may well be Rev. Torres' last 
Christmas," said Rev.Alfonso Rom�n, of Puerto Rico's Comit� Pro Derechos 
Humanos (Human Rights Committee), whose letter writing campaign aims to 
convince Oxford and Bureau of Prisons officials to allow the family 
visit.Joining the campaign will be many of Rev. Torres' friends and 
colleaguesfrom the religious community, including Rev. Heriberto 
Mart�nez,Evangelical Council of Puerto Rico; Rev. Luis Rosario, Conference 
MinisterUnited Evangelical Church of Puerto Rico, Rev. Miguel Vilar and Rev. 
Cheo Vilar of the Episcopal Church of Puerto Rico; Rev. Nozomi Ikuta of the 
Interfaith Prisoners of Conscience Project. in Cleveland, OH; and Father 
Angel Dar�o Carrero of the Jesuits of Puerto Rico. On Sunday, December 22, 
churches throughout Puerto Rico and the United States devoted their services 
to the Torres family, praying for their reunion.

support for the government of the state of Israel and the apartheid-based
economy of Israel through its official support of the New Jersey-Israel

the purse should be used for justice rather than injustice, join us!

of lives! Use your body to fight injustice - join us!

Students, faculty, alumni and NJ residents will speak in support of
institutional divestment to the press, expressing their concerns and

Petition
We, the undersigned, are appalled by the human rights abuses against
Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli government, the continual
military occupation and colonization of Palestinian territory by Israeli
armed forces and settlers, and the forcible eviction from and demolition
of Palestinian homes, towns and cities.

As members of the Rutgers University community, we call for the university
to apply its human rights ideals where its dollars are invested. That is,
we urge the university to use its political and financial influence to
encourage the United States government to suspend its military aid and
arms sale to Israel. We also call upon Rutgers University to divest from
from Israel, from US companies that sell arms to Israel, and from US
companies engaged in business with Israel until the following conditions
are met:

*Israel is in compliance with United Nations Resolution 242, which notes
the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war, and which
calls for withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from occupied territories.


*Israel is in compliance with the United Nations Committee Against Torture
2001 Report, which recommends that Israel's use of legal torture be ended.


*In compliance with the Fourth Geneva Convention ("The occupying power
shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into
territories it occupies"; Article 49, Paragraph 6), Israel ceases building
new settlements, and vacates existing settlements, in the Occupied
Territories.


*Israel acknowledges the applicability of Untied Nations Resolution 194
with respect to the rights of refugees to return to their former lands
(also outlined in the Fourth Geneva Convention).


The undersigned,

By Ricardo Olivero Lora of Bandera Roja
Translated by Benjamin Ramos of ProLibertad

On Thursday January 23rd, 2003, After completing 11 months in MDC Guaynabo 
in Puerto Rico, Pedro Colon Almenas was transferred to a Half Way House to 
complete the rest of his  sentence.

Pedro, who was very animated and excited, was taken in a taxi from MDC 
Guaynabo to the Half Way House in Trujillo Alto.  Pedro was received by a 
support rally made up of youth and family outside of the prison, Pedro 
stated, "Thank you for the ROTC strike!!", a comment directed to the student 
strike against the ROTC at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras.

The Half Way House program has less restrictions than a prison.  A person in 
the program can work or study outside the confines of the Half Way House 
from 6am-6pm and can be visited by friends and family on a regular basis.

Pedro will stay in the Half Way House until his sentence is completed on 
February 21st, 2003.  "Even though we are happy that we will soon be 
reunited with Pedro, we must denounce the fact that he will still be a 
victim of repression, because he will be under parole for three years", 
commented Hugo Delgado Marti, spokesperson of the Comite de Apoyo de Pedro.

In a press conference organized in the encampments close to the detention 
center, it was announced that Pedro would be received on February 25th at 
the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras.  This activity would be 
coordinated by the Consejo General de Estudiantes in conjunction with other

PEDRO COLON ALMENAS IS OUT OF JAIL AND IN A HALF WAY HOUSE!!

By Ricardo Olivero Lora of Bandera Roja
Translated by Benjamin Ramos of ProLibertad

On Thursday January 23rd, 2003, After completing 11 months in MDC Guaynabo 
in Puerto Rico, Pedro Colon Almenas was transferred to a Half Way House to 
complete the rest of his  sentence.

Pedro, who was very animated and excited, was taken in a taxi from MDC
Guaynabo to the Half Way House in Trujillo Alto.  Pedro was received by a 
support rally made up of youth and family outside of the prison, Pedro 
stated, "Thank you for the ROTC strike!!", a comment directed to the student 
strike against the ROTC at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras.

The Half Way House program has less restrictions than a prison.  A person in 
the program can work or study outside the confines of the Half Way House 
from 6am-6pm and can be visited by friends and family on a regular basis.

Pedro will stay in the Half Way House until his sentence is completed on 
February 21st, 2003.  "Even though we are happy that we will soon be
reunited with Pedro, we must denounce the fact that he will still be a
victim of repression, because he will be under parole for three years",
commented Hugo Delgado Marti, spokesperson of the Comite de Apoyo de Pedro.

In a press conference organized in the encampments close to the detention 
center, it was announced that Pedro would be received on February 25th at 
the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras.  This activity would be 
coordinated by the Consejo General de Estudiantes in conjunction with other 
student organizations.

The press conference was attended by Roberto Rabin, del Comit� Pro Rescate y 
Desarrollo de Vieques; Jorge Farinacci, of the  Frente Socialista; �ngel 
Santos, of La Hermandad de Empleados Exentos No Docentes de la UPR;

PRESS RELEASE

Reverend Jos� Alberto Torres of Chicago has a distinction few others
canclaim: his wife Alejandrina Torres, his son Carlos Alberto Torres, and 
his(now former) daughter-in-law Hayde� Beltr�n, all went to prison in 
theUnited States for seeking Puerto Rico's independence from the U.S. In 
1999,after serving 16 years, Alejandrina was released when President Clinton 
commuted the sentences of eleven of Puerto Rico's political 
prisoners,finding their sentences ranging from 35 to 90 years were 
disproportionatelylengthy. Inexplicably, Mr. Clinton left behind Carlos 
Alberto, whose disproportionate 70 year sentence will keep him imprisoned 
until the year 2024.Upon her release she applied to visit her stepson Carlos 
Alberto at FCIOxford, Wisconsin, to reunite with him and to take Rev. Torres 
to see their son together. While parole authorities supported this family 
reunion, Oxford prison authorities denied the request, in spite of Carlos 
Alberto's exemplary conduct; in spite of the fact that Alejandrina, like all 
eleven of those whose sentences were commuted, had successfully reintegrated 
into civil society; and in spite of their having permitted other former
prisoners to visit their imprisoned family members.Now, three years later, 
Alejandrina continues to work as a mentor in analternative high school, to 
participate in her church and community, and to fully comply with the 
conditions of her parole. And now, three years later, Reverend Torres, with 
cancer raging through his 80 year old body, has again been denied this 
family reunion, the prison having once again turned down their modest 
request to be permitted to share together in the confines of the prison 
visiting room under the watchful eye of prison officials. "It would mean so 
much to Papi," daughter Dr. Catalina Torres stated, "to be able to see Mami 
and Berti (Carlos Alberto) together before he dies.""Christmas is such an

YURI'S BIOGRAPHY AND A SPECIAL PEOPLE'S NOTE:

Yuri Kochiyama

Yuri Kochiyama is one of the most revered and beloved activists our movement 
has known.  She spans decades of activism and worlds of cultures and 
political movements.  Born in 1921 in San Pedro California, by the time she 
was 21, Yuri was interned in one of the concentration camps set up for 
Japanese-Americans during World War II.  She was  in Jerome, Arkansas.  She 
spent two years in that camp, from 1942 - 1944.  After that she went to 
Hattisburg, Mississippi, working for the USO specifically to help 
Japanese-American soldiers.   When the war ended Yuri was happy to reunite 
with Bill Kochiyama, her lifelong partner, who returned from fighting with 
the 442 Battalion, an all Japanese-American combat unit acclaimed as one of 
the most courageous infantry groups in US history.

After coming to New York, Yuri worked with Harlem Parents, and later with 
Malcolm in the Organization of Afro-American Unity.  She organized a welcome 
for Hiroshima and Nagasaki victims who came to this country, and Malcolm 
attended that welcome.  As has  been documented on film, Yuri was in the 
Audubon the day Malcolm was assassinated, and she ran up to the stage to 
help him and to make sure the children and Betty were safe.

During the Viet Nam War, Yuri participated in the Asian-American organized 
opposition to the war.  By the 70's,  with the intense attacks on the Black 
Panther Party, Yuri became involved in the National Committee for the 
Defense of Political Prisoners, thus beginning more than three decades of 
her legendary support for political prisoners.  Her Christmas letters to 
friends, to this day, detail the situation of every political prisoner she 
can track down, and her caring dedication to each of them is an inspiration 
to all those who do political prisoner support work.

Many a political prisoner, including those who've gotten out, has paid 
tribute to what Yuri's support meant to those who were incarcerated.  In 
addition to her work in the movement, Yuri taught conversational English at 
Riverside Church from 1983 to 1993, and later spent ten years volunteering 
at a soup kitchen and homeless shelter.  In 1993 Bill Kochiyama, Yuri's 
husband, died and was mourned by hundreds of people from family, to friends, 
to activists giving a small sense of who the Kochiyamas were, and how much 
they were treasured.

Yuri continues to be a much sought after lecturer at dozens of colleges and 
universities, including such places as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Radcliffe, 
Oberlin, and the University of Hawaii.  She also spoke at many high schools 
and even some junior high schools and elementary schools.


Finally, Yuri participated in the 1987 Venceremos Brigade, and travelled to 
both Peru and the Phillipines in  support of political prisoners.

This is truly only a biographical SKETCH of Yuri's incredible life to this 
date.  She has been the recipient of dozens of awards, tributes, and honors.

But most of all, she is beloved by many hundreds of activists and people -- 
from those who've worked with  her and know her well to those who've simply 
crossed paths with her and were inspired by her modest, charming, and 
powerful presence.

A NOTE FROM YURI

January 30, 2003

I am 81 going on 82.  Born in San Pedro, Calif 1921.  World War II -1942 - 
spent Concentration Camp in Jerome, Arkansas.  1946 - came to New York,  
married Bill Kochiyama , member of the 442nd All Japanese American Infantry. 
Bill grew up right here where the St. Mary's Church stands.  But then it was 
called Sheltering Arms, an orphanage.  In 1960, we were lucky to get into 
the Manhattanville Project (right across the street).  Before that, we lived 
at Amsterdam Houses   So, you can see, I've come home.

Just want to thank all the people who came into my life while living in New 
York for 54 years; 40 years in Harlem.  It was the movement and the people 
in the movement, that I owe my life's purpose, meaningfulness and friendship 
to (Black/New African, Puerto Rican/Latinos, White/anti-imperialist, the few 
American Indians/Indigenous, Asian Americans, and mixed blood folks.

Thanx, too, to all the others - family friends, neighbors, project friends, 
my kids' friends. etc.  What a huge life you gave me!  Love and thanx for 
the many ways you blessed me.

Remembering
Gratefully always,
Yuri

and even some junior high schools and elementary schools.


Finally, Yuri participated in the 1987 Venceremos Brigade, and travelled to 
both Peru and the Phillipines in  support of political prisoners.

This is truly only a biographical SKETCH of Yuri's incredible life to this 
date.  She has been the recipient of dozens of awards, tributes, and honors.

But most of all, she is beloved by many hundreds of activists and people -- 
from those who've worked with  her and know her well to those who've simply 
crossed paths with her and were inspired by her modest, charming, and 
powerful presence.

A NOTE FROM YURI

January 30, 2003

I am 81 going on 82.  Born in San Pedro, Calif 1921.  World War II -1942 - 
spent Concentration Camp in Jerome, Arkansas.  1946 - came to New York,  
married Bill Kochiyama , member of the 442nd All Japanese American Infantry. 
Bill grew up right here where the St. Mary's Church stands.  But then it was 
called Sheltering Arms, an orphanage.  In 1960, we were lucky to get into 
the Manhattanville Project (right across the street).  Before that, we lived 
at Amsterdam Houses   So, you can see, I've come home.

Just want to thank all the people who came into my life while living in New 
York for 54 years; 40 years in Harlem.  It was the movement and the people 
in the movement, that I owe my life's purpose, meaningfulness and friendship 
to (Black/New African, Puerto Rican/Latinos, White/anti-imperialist, the few 
American Indians/Indigenous, Asian Americans, and mixed blood folks.

Thanx, too, to all the others - family friends, neighbors, project friends, 
my kids' friends. etc.  What a huge life you gave me!  Love and thanx for 
the many ways you blessed me.

Remembering
Gratefully always,
Yuri

YURI'S BIOGRAPHY AND A SPECIAL PEOPLE'S NOTE:

Yuri Kochiyama

Yuri Kochiyama is one of the most revered and beloved activists our movement 
has known.  She spans decades of activism and worlds of cultures and 
political movements.  Born in 1921 in San Pedro California, by the time she 
was 21, Yuri was interned in one of the concentration camps set up for 
Japanese-Americans during World War II.  She was  in Jerome, Arkansas.  She 
spent two years in that camp, from 1942 - 1944.  After that she went to 
Hattisburg, Mississippi, working for the USO specifically to help 
Japanese-American soldiers.   When the war ended Yuri was happy to reunite 
with Bill Kochiyama, her lifelong partner, who returned from fighting with 
the 442 Battalion, an all Japanese-American combat unit acclaimed as one of 
the most courageous infantry groups in US history.

After coming to New York, Yuri worked with Harlem Parents, and later with 
Malcolm in the Organization of Afro-American Unity.  She organized a welcome 
for Hiroshima and Nagasaki victims who came to this country, and Malcolm 
attended that welcome.  As has  been documented on film, Yuri was in the 
Audubon the day Malcolm was assassinated, and she ran up to the stage to 
help him and to make sure the children and Betty were safe.

During the Viet Nam War, Yuri participated in the Asian-American organized 
opposition to the war.  By the 70's,  with the intense attacks on the Black 
Panther Party, Yuri became involved in the National Committee for the 
Defense of Political Prisoners, thus beginning more than three decades of 
her legendary support for political prisoners.  Her Christmas letters to 
friends, to this day, detail the situation of every political prisoner she 
can track down, and her caring dedication to each of them is an inspiration 
to all those who do political prisoner support work.

Many a political prisoner, including those who've gotten out, has paid
tribute to what Yuri's support meant to those who were incarcerated.  In 
addition to her work in the movement, Yuri taught conversational English at 
Riverside Church from 1983 to 1993, and later spent ten years volunteering 
at a soup kitchen and homeless shelter.  In 1993 Bill Kochiyama, Yuri's 
husband, died and was mourned by hundreds of people from family, to friends, 
to activists giving a small sense of who the Kochiyamas were, and how much 
they were treasured.

Yuri continues to be a much sought after lecturer at dozens of colleges and 
universities, including such places as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Radcliffe, 
Oberlin, and the University of Hawaii.  She also spoke at many high schools 
and even some junior high schools and elementary schools.


Finally, Yuri participated in the 1987 Venceremos Brigade, and travelled to 
both Peru and the Phillipines in  support of political prisoners.

This is truly only a biographical SKETCH of Yuri's incredible life to this 
date.  She has been the recipient of dozens of awards, tributes, and honors.

But most of all, she is beloved by many hundreds of activists and people --

This July, the 34th contingent of the Venceremos Brigade will spend twoweeks 
in Cuba. As part of a �Travel Challenge,� organized with IFCO/Pastors for 
Peace, Brigadistas will challenge the u.s. blockade on Cuba. We hope that 
your organization will play a role in this year�s contingent, either by 
sending representatives on the trip and/or supporting our efforts in other 
ways.On SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 8TH FROM 3:00PM-5:00PM, we will be holding 
aninformational meeting for all those interested in finding out more.

The meeting will be held at 10 Park Terrace East, #1L (A train to 207th St, 
1 train to 215th St).For more information and to confirm your organization�s 
attendance, please email vbrigade@... or call 212-560-4360. 
Individuals with no organizational affiliation are also encouraged to 
attend.

The Venceremos Brigade is an anti-imperialist educational project that,since 
1969, has sent over 8,000 people to Cuba. A national organization, the 
Brigade brings people together from all over the U.S. for an unforgettable, 
life changing experience. During trips, brigadistas participate in 
agricultural and/or construction work while also learning about Cuba�s 
revolution, history, and culture.This year, the Venceremos Brigade has 
launched a special campaign. Along with IFCO/Pastors for Peace, we are 
calling upon people across the country to join a mass �Travel Challenge.� 
Around 75% of the U.S. population, including a majority of Cuban Americans, 
want an end to the travel ban. Over the past two years, both houses of 
Congress have voted not to enforce the travel restrictions. Yet, since Bush 
became president, harassment of travelers to Cuba, both licensed and 
unlicensed, has greatly increased. In this climate, it is clear that the 
Cuba solidarity movement must take a stand.The Venceremos Brigade has always 
traveled unlicensed in order to make a statement against the U.S. blockade 
on Cuba, an inhumane policy that attacks both the island�s sovereignty and 
its 11 million people. This July, however, brigadistas will make our most 
open challenge to the U.S. travel restrictions. In order for the �Travel 
Challenge� to work, a lot of folks will have to participate.The �Travel 
Challenge� is not the only reason to (re)join the Venceremos Brigade now. 
The 34th contingent will participate in Cuba�s national celebrations for a 
special July 26th--this year marks the 50th anniversary of the attack on the 
Moncada Garrison. The trip will have a special concentration on Cuba�s 
elders, as we hope to participate in the renovation of la Habana�s �Casas de 
Ancianos,� and to collect oral histories from some of the island�s elder 
generation. The program will also include events centered around Cuban hip 
hop, democracy, health care, education, among other topics.

YURI'S BIOGRAPHY AND A SPECIAL PEOPLE'S NOTE:

Yuri Kochiyama

Yuri Kochiyama is one of the most revered and beloved activists our movement 
has known. She spans decades of activism and worlds of cultures and 
political movements. Born in 1921 in San Pedro California, by the time she 
was 21, Yuri was interned in one of the concentration camps set up for 
Japanese-Americans during World War II. She was in Jerome, Arkansas. She 
spent two years in that camp, from 1942 - 1944. After that she went to 
Hattisburg, Mississippi, working for the USO specifically to help 
Japanese-American soldiers. When the war ended Yuri was happy to reunite 
with Bill Kochiyama, her lifelong partner, who returned from fighting with 
the 442 Battalion, an all Japanese-American combat unit acclaimed as one of 
the most courageous infantry groups in US history.

After coming to New York, Yuri worked with Harlem Parents, and later with 
Malcolm in the Organization of Afro-American Unity. She organized a welcome 
for Hiroshima and Nagasaki victims who came to this country, and Malcolm 
attended that welcome. As has been documented on film, Yuri was in the 
Audubon the day Malcolm was assassinated, and she ran up to the stage to 
help him and to make sure the children and Betty were safe.

During the Viet Nam War, Yuri participated in the Asian-American organized 
opposition to the war. By the 70's, with the intense attacks on the Black 
Panther Party, Yuri became involved in the National Committee for the 
Defense of Political Prisoners, thus beginning more than three decades of 
her legendary support for political prisoners. Her Christmas letters to 
friends, to this day, detail the situation of every political prisoner she 
can track down, and her caring dedication to each of them is an inspiration 
to all those who do political prisoner support work.

Many a political prisoner, including those who've gotten out, has paid
tribute to what Yuri's support meant to those who were incarcerated. In
addition to her work in the movement, Yuri taught conversational English at 
Riverside Church from 1983 to 1993, and later spent ten years volunteering 
at a soup kitchen and homeless shelter. In 1993 Bill Kochiyama, Yuri's 
husband, died and was mourned by hundreds of people from family, to friends, 
to activists giving a small sense of who the Kochiyamas were, and how much 
they were treasured.

Yuri continues to be a much sought after lecturer at dozens of colleges and 
universities, including such places as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Radcliffe, 
Oberlin, and the University of Hawaii. She also spoke at many high schools 
and even some junior high schools and elementary schools.


Finally, Yuri participated in the 1987 Venceremos Brigade, and travelled to 
both Peru and the Phillipines in support of political prisoners.

This is truly only a biographical SKETCH of Yuri's incredible life to this 
date. She has been the recipient of dozens of awards, tributes, and honors.

But most of all, she is beloved by many hundreds of activists and people -- 
from those who've worked with her and know her well to those who've simply 
crossed paths with her and were inspired by her modest, charming, and 
powerful presence.

A NOTE FROM YURI

January 30, 2003

I am 81 going on 82. Born in San Pedro, Calif 1921. World War II -1942
-spent Concentration Camp in Jerome, Arkansas. 1946 - came to New York,
married Bill Kochiyama , member of the 442nd All Japanese American Infantry. 
Bill grew up right here where the St. Mary's Church stands. But then it was 
called Sheltering Arms, an orphanage. In 1960, we were lucky to get into the 
Manhattanville Project (right across the street). Before that, we lived at 
Amsterdam Houses So, you can see, I've come home.

Just want to thank all the people who came into my life while living in New 
York for 54 years; 40 years in Harlem. It was the movement and the people in 
the movement, that I owe my life's purpose, meaningfulness and friendship to 
(Black/New African, Puerto Rican/Latinos, White/anti-imperialist, the few
American Indians/Indigenous, Asian Americans, and mixed blood folks.

Thanx, too, to all the others - family friends, neighbors, project friends, 
my kids' friends. etc. What a huge life you gave me! Love and thanx for the 
many ways you blessed me.

Remembering
Gratefully always,
Yuri

Dr. Adel Samara is a Palestinian writer and researcher who was born in
1944 in Beit Uor, Ramallah area, where he continues to live today. He
holds a Ph.D. degree in political economy and development from Exeter
University - United Kingdom.

For more than two decades, Dr. Samara has written extensively about the
most vital issues facing Arab and Palestinian struggles. He has written a
plethora of books, both in Arabic and English, and co-authored and edited
numerous articles and essays. His most recent book, "Epidemic of
Globalization: Ventures in World Order, Arab Nation and Zionism", was

Due to his political views and activism, Dr. Samara had to face
imprisonment several times. He was arrested three times by the Jordanian
authority and spent two and half years in West Bank jails before the 1967
war. Under the Israeli occupation, he was imprisoned for five and half
years. Most recently, November 1999, as one of the signatories of the
Bayan Al-Ishreen (The declaration of the Twenty) he was placed under
arrest for twenty-three days by the Palestinian Authority with other
Palestinian leaders.

Subject:Pedro Colon Almenas FREE!!<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is proud to announce the freedom of Puerto 
Rican Political Prisoner, Pedro Colon Almenas, today, Friday Feb. 21st, 
2003!!

As of  today, Pedro Colon Almenas has been freed from MDC Guaynabo!!  Pedro 
was greeted by a support rally outside the prison, made up of friends, 
allies and family.

Despite a minor set back this week, Pedro having been re-arrested and sent 
back to MDC Guaynabo for failing to call in to the Half Way House in 
Trujillo Alto at an appointed time, Pedro was still released on his 
appointed day with no hassle.

In actuality, Pedro was arrested for participating on a radio talk show on 
Friday February 14th.  His participation was well received by the audience. 
Activists in Puerto Rico believe that his participation on the radio show 
called attention to himself and made the officials at MDC Guaynabo nervous, 
espcieally about the political content of Pedro's interview.  This caused 
them to immediately respond by re-arresting Pedro and keeping him in MDC 
Guaynabo for the remainder of the week.

The Comite de Apoyo de Pedro responded by organizing several press 
conferences the week of his release to denounce his return to MDC Guaynabo 
and to demand that his release on Friday not be impeded.

After serving a year of incarceration in MDC Guaynabo, Pedro is finally free 
and able to join his family, friends and comrades.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign urges all of our allies and supporters to 
take sometime out and send Pedro a letter or post card congratulating him on 
his release.  He can written to at the following address:

Pedro Col�n Almenas
PO BOX 30724
San Juan PR 00929-1724

**CIVIL RIGHTS MARCH ON WASHINGTON, DC 
&gt; TO SAVE BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION 
&gt;_________________________________________________________________ 
&gt; 
&gt; * Please forward this email widely * 
&gt; 
&gt;On April 1, thousands of high school and college students will 
&gt;march through the streets of Washington, DC to the U.S. Supreme 
&gt;Court demanding that the high court uphold affirmative action in 
&gt;the University of Michigan cases. These two cases represent a 
&gt;turning point in regard to race relations and for our entire 
&gt;society. This is a struggle for integration and equality in 
&gt;education and throughout American life. Now is the time to stand 
&gt;up. 
&gt; 
&gt;Affirmative action is a desegregation plan for higher education. 
&gt;If affirmative action is barred, higher education in America will 
&gt;be resegregated. Already, integration plans in K-12 education 
&gt;have been attacked across the country. As a result, segregation 
&gt;in K-12 education increased dramatically. 
&gt; 
&gt;A VICTORY AT THE SUPREME COURT will open up a new struggle for 
&gt;progress towards integration and equality in education and 
&gt;throughout American society. A victory will present a better 
&gt;opportunity than we have had for generations to reconcile the 
&gt;segregated, unequal reality of our educational system with the 
&gt;hope and pride that the overwhelming majority of Americans of all 
&gt;races feel in the prospect of integration and equality. 
&gt; 
&gt;A DEFEAT would outlaw any and all active integrationist measures 
&gt;in this society, without which there has never been and can never 
&gt;be any prospect of genuine integration. If positive 
&gt;integrationist measures are barred, Brown v. Board of Education 
&gt;will be a dead letter. 
&gt; 
&gt;An unprecedented, public divide between President Bush and 
&gt;Secretary of State Colin Powell over the University of Michigan 
&gt;affirmative action policies illustrates the peculiar importance 
&gt;of these cases. The outcome of this struggle teeters on a razor's 
&gt;edge between victory and defeat. Your voice and your organizing 
&gt;can tip the balance. Only this civil rights march can guarantee 
&gt;victory in these critical cases. We have a little over two months 
&gt;to force a positive change in history. 
&gt; 
&gt;BEGIN ORGANIZING a contingent from your school, trade union, 
&gt;church, or community organization immediately. Do not wait to 
&gt;hear back from us. Spread the word about the march; take the 
&gt;pledge and call to action (see below); email everyone you know, 
&gt;all your friends and relatives. Tell them this historic turning 
&gt;point demands their voice. 
&gt; 
&gt;Now is the time to affiliate your organization to BAMN or form a 
&gt;local chapter of BAMN (Guidelines for doing both are found in 
&gt;points #1 &amp; 2 in the BAMN Principles: 
&gt;http://www.bamn.com/1/principles.asp). 
&gt; 
&gt;The new civil rights movement must meet either victory or defeat 
&gt;at the Supreme Court with a greatly expanded fight to make real 
&gt;the promise of Brown v. Board of Education - the long-deferred 
&gt;promise of integration and equality. 
&gt; 
&gt;Please contact us with any ideas or questions. Please forward

New York Ricans from the Hip Hop Zone is the first book to explore Puerto 
Ricans' participation in the development of Hip Hop culture- from the 
beginning- to the present.  Using hip hop culture as a focal point, Rivera 
draws parallels-past and present-between African Americans and Puerto Ricans 
by highlighting their shared New York City history and their both being part 
of the African Diaspora in the Americas.
*****
Raquel has done the unthinkable-she has triumphed in creating what hip hop 
DJs normally call a remix. She has remixed history and shed light on a 
valuable coexistence that is normally shunned by the media-namely, Boriquas 
represent." -BOBBITO GARCIA, DJ Cucumberslice

"Big Pun, Fat Joe, Angie Martinez, La Bruja and many other Puerto Rican 
rappers speak out here in full voice, and the result is the most 
authoritative and exciting account of the Nuyorican role in hip hop to 
date." -JUAN FLORES, author of From Bomba to Hip Hop: Puerto Rican Culture 
and Latino Identity

"Raquel untangles this wildly woven fabric called hip hop and uncovers the 
unbreakable strands of Puerto Ricans that have been in all the elements of 
hip hop since day one. Clap your hands everybody!!!" -CHARLIE CHASE, 
pioneering DJ and MC, Cold Crush Brothers

"Its about time that a book has come out showing the contribution Puerto 
Ricans have made to the hip hop movement." -JAMEL SHABAZZ, photographer, 
Back in the Days

"A much-needed examination of New York Puerto Ricans' essential 
contributions to and continued vitality in the hip hop universe. Rivera's 
edgy mix of academic research and inner-circle interviews help redefine the 
way we look at urban street culture." -ED MORALES, author, Living in 
Spanglish

"Smart and provocative, New York Ricans from the Hip Hop Zone is written 
with clarity and style by someone who knows both hip hop and Puerto Rican 
culture from the inside out. Not only a must read, it's a great read." 
-DEBORAH PACINI HERNANDEZ, Tufts University

&gt;throughout American society. A victory will present a better 
&gt;opportunity than we have had for generations to reconcile the 
&gt;segregated, unequal reality of our educational system with the 
&gt;hope and pride that the overwhelming majority of Americans of all 
&gt;races feel in the prospect of integration and equality. 
&gt; 
&gt;A DEFEAT would outlaw any and all active integrationist measures 
&gt;in this society, without which there has never been and can never 
&gt;be any prospect of genuine integration. If positive 
&gt;integrationist measures are barred, Brown v. Board of Education 
&gt;will be a dead letter. 
&gt; 
&gt;An unprecedented, public divide between President Bush and 
&gt;Secretary of State Colin Powell over the University of Michigan 
&gt;affirmative action policies illustrates the peculiar importance 
&gt;of these cases. The outcome of this struggle teeters on a razor's 
&gt;edge between victory and defeat. Your voice and your organizing 
&gt;can tip the balance. Only this civil rights march can guarantee 
&gt;victory in these critical cases. We have a little over two months 
&gt;to force a positive change in history. 
&gt; 
&gt;BEGIN ORGANIZING a contingent from your school, trade union, 
&gt;church, or community organization immediately. Do not wait to 
&gt;hear back from us. Spread the word about the march; take the 
&gt;pledge and call to action (see below); email everyone you know, 
&gt;all your friends and relatives. Tell them this historic turning 
&gt;point demands their voice.

&gt; 
&gt;The new civil rights movement must meet either victory or defeat 
&gt;at the Supreme Court with a greatly expanded fight to make real 
&gt;the promise of Brown v. Board of Education - the long-deferred

Subject:SUPPORT THE CUBAN FIVE!!<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>URGENT ALERT ABOUT THE CUBAN FIVE/
March 7th, 2003

URGENT ALERT: The Cuban 5 have been placed in solidarity confinement and
they need your help!

The five Cuban political prisoners in the U.S. were suddenly and without
justification thrown into solitary confinement on March 3, 2003 in their
separate prisons. It is not clear how long the punishment will last.

Prison authorities have not given the official reason for their illegal
confinement in "the hole", but apparently it is a decision
from the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Washington, and has the markings of 
directed political repression against the Five.

As Leonard Weinglass, appeals attorney for Antonio Guerrero, one of the
Cuban Five in Florence Colorado prison, said, "None of them
belongs in solitary confinement. It is completely unjustified and
unnecessary as all of them are model prisoners."

Weinglass has urged supporters of the Cuban Five to write immediately
to the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Washington. We ask that you do not 
writeto the individual prisons, as they are not responsible for the 
confinementorder.

The address of the Federal Bureau of Prisons is:
320 First St. N.W.
Washington DC 20534.

The telephone number is 202-307-3198.
Hours are Monday-Friday, 8 am to 5 pm.

Weinglass noted in an interview with Radio Havana Cuba yesterday that the 
Black Panther prisoners in the U.S. were similarly rounded up
into solitary right after 9/11. (Read the complete interview with Weinglass 
after this notice.)

There is speculation that they are being confined just as the U.S.
government is preparing for a massive war against Iraq.

It is no coincidence that the Justice Department's repression of Arab,
Muslim and immigrant communities is also being aimed against the Cuban Five, 
whose only "crime" was fighting U.S.-sponsored terrorism against Cuba.

Gerardo Hern�ndez, Ram�n Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero, Ren� Gonz�lez, and 
Fernando Gonz�lez have been imprisoned since September 1998
when they were arrested by the FBI on trumped-up charges of espionage on the 
United States. In reality they were prosecuted by the U.S. for
defending their country of Cuba from U.S.-sponsored and supported terrorism 
that emanates from Miami.

The Five lived in Miami since the early 1990s where they were on a vital
mission of monitoring anti-Cuba terrorist groups there to prevent violence 
against their country of Cuba. More than 3,400 Cubans have been killed by 
the anti-Cuba violence.

At two of the prisons on Friday, Cuba 5 supporters were ready to visit the 
compa�eros when they were turned away. Reverend Geoff Bottoms flew in from 
Blackpool, England to see Ram�n Laba�ino in Beaumont federal prison in exas. 
He was told without explanation that Ram�n was not permitted visitors.

Alicia Jrapko and Tanya Cole were at Lompoc prison to visit Gerardo
Hern�ndez. Jrapko was told, "It is possible they will not get any
more visitors other than their family in the future."

We ask all supporters to write to the Bureau of Prisons, expressing your
concern for their safety, and that you protest the unjust and
unnecessary solitary confinement. Their exemplary behavior does not warrant 
this kind of treatment. There is reason to believe they are singled out 
because they are political prisoners.

It is also essential that their attorneys have full and unrestricted access 
to their clients, especially at this critical time while they're preparing 
for the April 7th appeals court date in Atlanta. Weinglass was unable to 
speak with Antonio for two days although he had
authorized collect calls from him.

It is undoubtedly very stressful for their family members. They had only
just returned to Cuba, after coming to the U.S. to visit their loved ones.
The families had been delayed their entry visas by the
U.S. government for more than six months. Two of the wives, Olga Salanueva
and Adriana Perez are still prohibited from entering the U.S.

2) Radio Havana Cuba Interview with Leonard Weinglass Commenting on the
Change in Status of the Five Cuban Political Prisoners in the US.
7th March 2003

Bernie Dwyer: Good evening, Mr. Weinglass. The president of the Cuban
Parliament, Ricardo Alarc�n announced during the first sitting of the
new Cuban National Assembly, Thursday March 6 that the five Cuban political
prisoners in the United States have been returned to isolation status in
their various penitential centers. Can you comment on that?

Leonard Weinglass: "Yes, I've been informed of this and
I've been in contact with the prison authorities for Antonio Guerrero out in
Colorado and they haven't been cooperating at all. I'm still trying
to reach Antonio to talk to him directly. Moving the five into isolation at
this time is an utterly unnecessary and irrational act,
which can only be motivated by a desire to increase their punishment and
have them held under even more harsh conditions than they have been held
under before. I don't see any justification for this
whatsoever. After 9/11 the government put all of the black panthers who are
held in various prisons throughout the United States also into isolation
which was an unjustified act and had nothing whatever
to do with whatever national crisis the government was claiming. I regard
this as probably the same as what happened to the Black
Panthers merely because they were political people being held for political
reasons, they were buried into an isolation status and I'm
afraid that that is happening with the five".

Bernie Dwyer: Mr. Weinglass, Are you saying that because of the impending US
war against Iraq, the five are now being treated as a security risk?

Leonard Weinglass: "Well, we can only guess at that because they refuse to
answer my enquiries about why that are doing this but the fact that they did
it to all five indicates that it is a policy decision and not the result of
any act of any one or any five of them. I do believe that it is related to
that although I haven't
had any official confirmation of it but as your question indicates, it is
completely irrational and unnecessary and not related to any security
concern of an realistic nature that the prison authorities might have".

Bernie Dwyer: Exactly what kinds of rights and privileges have been cut
back?

Leonard Weinglass: "Once you're put in isolation you
virtually lose all your rights. It's a very extreme and heightened form of
punishment. The only people you can communicate with are your
attorneys. Antonio was a teacher at the prison and I presume that he is not
permitted to teach. He is not permitted contact with others and he is held
in complete isolation. This is a very harsh form of punishment and it is
usually reserved for people who have violated major security provisions
within the institution. The
fact that the five are put there because of any imaginary national crisis
that is happening in the US has absolutely no relationship to any crisis".

Bernie Dwyer: You mentioned that the only person they can have contact with
is their attorney but it seems that even that particular right is not being
honored at the moment.

Leonard Weinglass: "You're right. I have been trying for two
days to talk to Antonio. They promised me that I could talk to him
yesterday.
I fulfilled all the requirements by writing letters, etc.,
authorizing Tony to call me collect but they haven't permitted him to use
the telephone. Not even that restricted right has been honored by the prison
authorities so far".

Bernie Dwyer: Mr. Weinglass, do you know of any other political prisoners
from other countries that that might be getting the same treatment?

Leonard Weinglass: "I have inquired from attorneys I know who have been
representing people from the Middle East who are being held in
various prisons and none has been able to give me any affirmative
information so I am not sure now how many are being put in this
condition or if any others are in fact but I hope sometime today to get an
confirmation from these attorneys as to the status of their clients".

Bernie Dwyer: To your knowledge, how long has this situation pertained?

Leonard Weinglass: "I was first notified of it on Wednesday
morning, the 5th and I don't know when it began but that was my first notice
of it. I found out while discussing the appeal with other attorneys
representing five. During the course of us discussing matters relating to
the appeal, one of the other attorneys indicated that he is unable to
communicate with his client. I then immediately began to
enquire about Antonio's status and I was informed that he was, in fact in
isolation. But they refused to tell me why".

Bernie Dwyer: Is there any positive actions that the solidarity groups and
the general public can take to support the five Cuban political prisoners to
roll back some of the problems that they are having at the moment?

Leonard Weinglass: "I think that the support network should be mobilized and
should contact the Bureau of Prisons and issue statements of complaint about
this condition and support for the five. In the past when the American Civil
Liberties Union or Amnesty
International has complained about an unjust change of status, frequently
the Bureau does back down so I would think that people should be
communicating to the Bureau of Prisons that the five should not be held in
this condition".

This interview was aired on Radio Havana Cuba on Friday, March 7 2003.Cuban
Five Are Placed in Solitary Confinement Without Explanation

3) The newly re-elected President of the Cuban National Assembly, Ricardo
Alarc�n, has condemned further abuses against the five Cuban political
prisoners in the United States.
In an address to the first gathering of the Assembly since general elections
in January, he said that all five had been placed in solitary confinement
without any reason given and that their attorneys were unable to visit them.

"We hope - he said - that the authorities, which staged the new violation of
the Five prisoners� human rights (proving their never-ending cruelty
capability), are able to put an end to the obstacles presented that prevent
them from being visited by their attorneys and such an unjustifiable action
right away. We ratify our commitment to keep on fighting to finish with this
injustice and get their freedom".

Alarc�n demanded that the United States Government grant access to the Five
by their lawyers, and decried their confinement in the "hole" as an abuse of
their human rights. All five Cubans suffered 17 months of solitary
confinement after they were arrested on September 12th, 1998. They all
reside in different prisons deliberately spread across the entire expanse of
the United States.

should contact the Bureau of Prisons and issue statements of complaint about
this condition and support for the five. In the past when the American Civil
Liberties Union or Amnesty
International has complained about an unjust change of status, frequently
the Bureau does back down so I would think that people should be
communicating to the Bureau of Prisons that the five should not be held in
this condition".

This interview was aired on Radio Havana Cuba on Friday, March 7 2003.Cuban
Five Are Placed in Solitary Confinement Without Explanation

3) The newly re-elected President of the Cuban National Assembly, Ricardo
Alarc�n, has condemned further abuses against the five Cuban political
prisoners in the United States.
In an address to the first gathering of the Assembly since general elections
in January, he said that all five had been placed in solitary confinement
without any reason given and that their attorneys were unable to visit them.

"We hope - he said - that the authorities, which staged the new violation of
the Five prisoners� human rights (proving their never-ending cruelty
capability), are able to put an end to the obstacles presented that prevent
them from being visited by their attorneys and such an unjustifiable action
right away. We ratify our commitment to keep on fighting to finish with this
injustice and get their freedom".

Alarc�n demanded that the United States Government grant access to the Five
by their lawyers, and decried their confinement in the "hole" as an abuse of
their human rights. All five Cubans suffered 17 months of solitary
confinement after they were arrested on September 12th, 1998. They all
reside in different prisons deliberately spread across the entire expanse of
the United States.

Free the 5 Cuban Political Prisoners!

Come Hear Defense Attorney Len Weinglass
Speak on the Case of the Cuban Five, May 8th


Criminal defense attorney Len Weinglass is currently
representing Cuban Antonio Guerrero in prison in Colorado
convicted of conspiracy along with four fellow Cubans, all
serving long sentences in American prisons. The Cuban Five
attempted to thwart the terrorism of Miami-based Cuban
counter-revolutionaries by documenting their activities and
turning the information over to the U.S. government in the hopes
that our government would stem the violence directed against
Cuba.

The government reciprocated, not by intervening against the
terrorists, but instead arrested the five Cubans on frame-up
charges and convicted them in Miami, where the intimidating
climate made a fair trial impossible. Weinglass has represented
defendants in significant political cases including Tom Hayden,
the Pentagon Papers, the Chicago Seven, Kathy Boudin, and most
recently Mumia Abu Jamal.

IMPORTANT: LATEST UPDATE:
From the National Committee to Free the Five Cuban Political
Prisoners in the United States
415-821-6545. fax: 415-821-5782. www.freethefive.org

Dear Friends of the Cuban Five:
A small but very important step toward freeing our five brothers
from the isolation cells they've been locked in, was achieved.
Two days ago, the attorneys' rights to visit their clients was
restored. For the last three weeks, not even the five appeals
lawyers were allowed to see or talk with the five Cuban
anti-terrorist heroes. However, the lawyer-client privilege of
confidentiality is still denied, as monitoring of their conversations
will be instituted.

The cells that Gerardo, Fernando, Rene, Ramon and Antonio
have been imprisoned in are tiny, with lights on 24 hours a day,
no way to know if it is night or day, and no contact with other
people. This is psychological torture and nothing less, meant to
punish the Five Cuban heroes, who have never faltered in their
defense of their country and principles of justice.

Their isolation is keeping them from contacts with their families
and attorneys, and constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
Unfortunately, many thousands of prisoners in the U.S. are in the
same isolation cells (SHUs) that have been roundly condemned
for their cruelty.

This last week, a mass mobilization was launched through the
Internet, by the Cuban 5 committees in the U.S. and around the
world. Many hundreds of calls and e-mails were made to
Attorney General John Ashcroft and Bureau of Prison director
Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, demanding their release from the "hole."
By all your actions, we let the government know we are vigilant of
the situation and protest every punitive move against the Five
Cuban brothers, and that we will continue to struggle for their
freedom.

Keep the pressure up! Don't stop calling or e-mailing the
Attorney General and the Bureau of Prisons to call for their
immediate release from isolation. Please organize a meeting in
your community on the Five. Check our website:
www.freethefive.org for the available resources and to see how
you can help.

According to Antonio Guerrero's attorney Leonard Weinglass, the
solitary confinement is part of a "special administrative" order,
from the Attorney General to the BOP for implementation. The
order claims that the Five's contacts with other people � by mail
or in person - could result in the unauthorized disclosure of
information that "could pose a threat to the national security of
the United States."

This is a complete fabrication as the Five brothers never had
anything to with information related to U.S. national security, or
classified material. They were protecting Cuba from the Miami
terrorists, unless the U.S. government considers the terrorists
part of their "national security."

The order lasts for one year and can be extended at any time by
Ashcroft.

Severe restrictions on their communication with the outside
world are in effect. Please be very conscious of the difficulties
they face at the moment. Please write to them to give them
encouragement and the warmth of your friendship and solidarity,
although if you see the urgent update about Gerardo Hern�ndez,
he is not getting ANYTHING to read. They may only be able to
respond with a very limited number of letters, because they are
given only a few stamps in the "hole." So far only Fernando
Gonz�lez has been able to write.

We will keep you posted. Please contact us if you have any
questions. Again, thank you all for your great responses. Free
the Five!


From the "Antiterrorism Working Group of the Cuban National
Parliament"
GRAVE VIOLATIONS AGAINST GERARDO HERNANDEZ
We urge all people who read this notice to let all your friends,
families, and colleagues know about it. It is very important.


March 17th, 2003
After frequent requests were made to Assistant United States
Attorney Caroline Heck Miller in Florida, on Sunday, March 16th,
US attorney Leonard Weinglass was able to gain permission to
visit Gerardo Hern�ndez - a visit that already had been planned
back in February before all of the Cuban Five were placed in
solitary confinement.

According to Weinglass, Gerardo is undergoing the most severe
punishment in his prison in Lompoc, California, where he is
confined to what is known as "the Box" within the Special
Housing Unit -a hole within the "Hole". He has been under this
regimen since February 28th when he was transferred to solitary
without any reason given.

He is confined to a very small cell in which one can walk only
three steps, with no windows and only a slot in the metal door
through which food is passed. The bars in front are covered with
a metal mesh screen through which it is almost impossible to
see anything and remain close 24 hours a day.

There is a toilet and a concrete bed with a thin pad in the cell.
His clothes were taken from him and he wears just underpants
and a T-shirt. No shoes.

He cannot tell when it is day or night. The lights in his cell are the
only ones that remain switched on 24 hours a day and the
constant cries of other prisoners, many of whom suffer mental
health problems, prevent him from sleeping.

No reading material or printed material is allowed. Signs are
posted in front of his cell, which states that no one is to have
contact with him. He is the only inmate in this segregation
regime who is not allowed to use the telephone.

Gerardo has unsuccessfully attempted to register a complaint
under the prison's established procedures but has been told
that there are no complaint forms available.

On March 2nd he filed an informal complaint, as the correct form
had not been supplied to him. He hasn't received a response.

On March 11th the prison authorities brought him a letter from
Joaqu�n M�ndez, one of the defense attorneys, but they took it
away before he could read it. On March 14th he was told that he
would be given his legal mail. However, to date he has received
nothing - not even correspondence from his attorneys.

The treatment that is currently being given to Gerardo, Ram�n,
Antonio, Fernando and Ren� is completely illegal and severely
obstructs their defense rights when they and their attorneys need
to prepare the appeal that is to be presented not later than April
7th. This cruel, unusual, discriminatory and completely
unjustifiable treatment constitutes a flagrant case of torture that
has to be strongly and urgently denounced.

contact with him. He is the only inmate in this segregation
regime who is not allowed to use the telephone.

Gerardo has unsuccessfully attempted to register a complaint
under the prison's established procedures but has been told
that there are no complaint forms available.

On March 2nd he filed an informal complaint, as the correct form
had not been supplied to him. He hasn't received a response.

On March 11th the prison authorities brought him a letter from
Joaqu�n M�ndez, one of the defense attorneys, but they took it
away before he could read it. On March 14th he was told that he
would be given his legal mail. However, to date he has received
nothing - not even correspondence from his attorneys.

The treatment that is currently being given to Gerardo, Ram�n,
Antonio, Fernando and Ren� is completely illegal and severely
obstructs their defense rights when they and their attorneys need
to prepare the appeal that is to be presented not later than April
7th. This cruel, unusual, discriminatory and completely
unjustifiable treatment constitutes a flagrant case of torture that
has to be strongly and urgently denounced.

Jenin, Jenin
Film Screening
FIRST TIME IN NEW JERSEY!
7:00 PM
Kreeger Learning Center
151 College Ave.
New Brunswick, NJ
Preceded by a moment of silence to remember Rachel Corrie and the
countless Palestinian martyrs to the struggle for liberation.
"Jenin Jenin" (54 minutes) shows the extent to which the prolonged
oppression and terror has affected the state of mind of the Palestinian
inhabitants of the Jenin refugee camp.
Listen to the old men, the children, the doctors and the grieving mothers
of Jenin, after the Israeli army's April 2002 attack flattened homes and
buried an unknown number of civilians. Bitterness and grief are the
prevailing feelings among the majority of the population. Many have lost
loved ones or are still searching for victims and belongings among the
debris. 'Where is God,' an elderly man desperately wonders when surveying
the debris in the Jenin refugee camp.
A little girl, who does not seem to be much older than twelve, tells her
story but knows no fear. The ongoing violence in her day-to-day life only
nourishes her feelings of hatred and the urge to take revenge. She shouts
that the Palestinians will never give up the struggle, that they will keep
on producing children who can continue the fight against injustice.
The sad question forces itself on the spectator. What will become of a
country, a people when its children are confronted with war and violence
from a very early age?
Banned in Israel, "Jenin Jenin" is dedicated to Iyad Samudi, the producer
of the film, who was shot dead by Israeli soldiers on June 23rd, 2002, as
he returned home after completing the film.

Four members of the New York-based solidarity group Jews Against the
Occupation will discuss their own experiences visiting Palestine as
International Solidarity Movement activists and their role as Jews in
opposing Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people.
Erica Weitzman travelled to the West Bank this past summer with other JATO
members as part of the International Solidarity Movement's "Freedom
Summer" campaign. Born in Washington, D.C., she has also lived in Boston,
Paris, and Kosovo. She currently lives in New York City.
Ryan Senser traveled to Palestine with other members of JATO in August to
work with Palestinian organizers and other activists from Europe, North
America, and Japan under the auspices of the International Solidarity
Movement. Only a decade ago, he participated in a pro-Zionist tour of
Israel, an experience he has now revisited and rethought extensively. He
is a former College Hillel President and led a delegation of Jewish
college students to Germany as part of a pilot dialogue program in 1995.
He has served as a Hebrew and Religious School teacher in the Jewish
communities in which he has lived.
Born in Jerusalem and the daughter of a rabbi, Ora Wise has worked with
rabbis for human rights with bedouins in West Bank. She co-founded a
Palestine solidarity organization at Ohio State University and helped
organize the Second National Student Conference on the Palestine
Solidarity Movement. She recently particpated in the Palestine Truth Tour
and currently teaches Jewish studies at a synagogue in Brooklyn.
Louisa Solomon participated in the ISM Freedom Summer campaign in August
2002. Alongside Palestinian non-violent organizers, she was injured by the
Israeli army while staging a peaceful demonstration in the Palestinian
town of Huwwara, near Nablus.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>NYC April 7 - Rally To Free The Cuban Five!

Friends,
Please forward this to your lists and spread the word!

If you care about Cuba...
if you care about justice...
if you care about exposing Bush's so-called "War on Terror"...then rally to 
free
the Cuban Five!

MONDAY APRIL 7 @ 12 NOON
RALLY TO FREE THE CUBAN FIVE
MANHATTAN FEDERAL BLDG
26 FEDERAL PLAZA
NEW YORK CITY

Who are the Cuban Five? They are five Cubans who were trying to stop the
ultra-right terrorist groups in Miami from carrying out violent actions 
againstthe people of Cuba.

The Cuban people have been targets of U.S. policy, including a 43-year 
economicblockade designed to punish a whole people who chose a different 
road to build their society. They are victims of terror attacks by the 
Miami-based mafia, many of whom came from the wealthy class that left Cuba 
after the popular overthrow of dictator Fulgencio Batista.

Gerardo Hern�ndez, Antonio Guerrero, Ram�n Laba�ino, Ren� Gonz�lez and 
Fernando Gonz�lez, acting in defense of their people, were living in Miami, 
monitoring these terrorist groups to prevent future violence.

But because the U.S. government � through the CIA � has been instrumental in 
funding, training and arming the ultra-right Miami mafia, the FBI targeted 
the five Cubans instead of arresting the terrorists.

This is the only reason that the five Cubans are in prison. They were framed 
up in a political witchhunt and railroaded by the U.S. in a 7-month trial in 
Miami, where it was impossible for them to have a fair trial.

Falsely charged with espionage on the U.S., in reality the five men�s 
mission was to follow the activities of the right-wing. After their arrest 
in September 1998,  they were convicted June 8, 2001 and sentenced December 
2001, from 17 years to life.      ( For a full analysis of the case, see: 
www.freethefive.org/whoare.cfm#analysis0103 )

NEW CRISIS DEVELOPS: In early March, Gerardo, Antonio, Ram�n, Fernando and 
Ren� were suddenly put into solitary confinement in their respective 
prisons, where they still are, suffering severe conditions and denied 
elementary rights. They are prohibited from contact with their families and 
friends, denied reading or writing material, and are greatly restricted from 
attorney visits. We ask people to call Attorney General John Ashcroft at 
202-353-1555 or e-mail: AskDOJ@... and urge their immediate release 
from �the hole.�

An international campaign has been launched to win freedom for the Cuban 
Five. This coming April, their appeals will be filed in the U.S. Court of 
Appeals in Atlanta. Already 17 countries from around the world have pledged 
to make the first week in April a week of international solidarity with the 
five.

Join community activists, religious and labor leaders, and people just like 
you on Monday, April 7th to stand in solidarity with these brave young men.

Subject:Five Cubans out of the Hole<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>La versi�n en Espa�ol sigue a la versi�n en Ingles

STATEMENT BY THE CUBAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
April 1st, 2003

As a result of public denunciation and numerous messages of protest,
the Government of Washington decided to put an end to the arbitrary
solitary confinement that it had imposed to Gerardo Hern�ndez, Ren�
Gonz�lez, Ram�n Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero and Fernando Gonz�lez, and
to place them again in the general penal population, although
maintaining against them several completely discriminatory
restrictions.

It has been demonstrated that during a month, the Government of the
United States violated the rights of the prisoners, of their lawyers
and the norms of due process, seriously damaging the appeal process.
Taking them now out of "the hole",  the U.S. Government is proving
that never existed a "national security" justification  and that it
was obliged to go back because of the denunciations and protests.

The U.S. Government has not finished yet with its arbitrary,
discriminatory and illegal actions. It still maintains inadmissible
prohibitions related to the use of the phone, the correspondence, the
consular access and the family visits, that should be completely
lifted.

It was proved the strength of the international solidarity and its
capacity to act with efficacy, even in very difficult circumstances,
due to the fact that the information about this issue in the big
media was virtually zero.

The Government of the United States in March, 2003 has repeated  the
methods and techniques that  it used before to  prevent a fair trial,
that is precisely the principal question that the Atlanta Appeal
Court should consider.  That is the best proof to demonstrate that
that Court should dismiss the Miami farce and order the release of
the five prisoners.

It is necessary to multiply and intensify the solidarity, now that we
have this additional proof about the serious misconduct of the U.S.
Government.

The solidarity took them out of "the hole".
The solidarity will free them.
The Cuban National Assembly
Havana, April 1st, 2003


DECLARACI�N DE LA ASAMBLEA NACIONAL DEL PODER POPULAR
1 de Abril del 2003

Como resultado de la denuncia p�blica y de numerosos mensajes de
protesta, el gobierno de Washington decidi� poner fin al arbitrario
confinamiento solitario que hab�a impuesto a Gerardo Hern�ndez, Ren�
Gonz�lez, Ram�n Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero y Fernando Gonz�lez y
ubicarlos otra vez en la poblaci�n penal general aunque a�n mantiene
contra ellos varias restricciones totalmente discriminatorias.

Ha quedado demostrado que el gobierno de Estados Unidos durante un
mes viol� los derechos de los prisioneros, los de sus abogados y las
normas del debido proceso da�ando gravemente el proceso de
apelaci�n.  Al sacarlos del "hueco" ahora el gobierno prueba que no
hab�a ninguna justificaci�n de "seguridad nacional" y que se vi�
obligado a retroceder ante la denuncia y la protesta.

El gobierno no ha terminado a�n con sus acciones arbitrarias,
discriminatorias e ilegales.  Mantiene todav�a prohibiciones
inadmisibles que deben ser eliminadas completamente en cuanto al uso
del tel�fono, la correspondencia, el acceso consular y las visitas
familiares.

Se prob� la fuerza de la solidaridad internacional y su capacidad
para actuar con eficacia incluso en circunstancias muy dif�ciles
sobre todo porque fue escas�sima la informaci�n publicada sobre este
asunto en los grandes medios.

El gobierno de Estados Unidos, en marzo de 2003 ha repetido los
m�todos y t�cnicas que ya emple� antes para hacer imposible un juicio
justo, que es precisamente la cuesti�n fundamental que la Corte de
Apelaciones de Atlanta debe considerar. Esta es la mejor prueba de
que esa Corte deber�a anular la farsa de Miami y disponer la
liberaci�n de los cinco prisioneros.

Es necesario multiplicar e intensificar la solidaridad ahora que
contamos con esta prueba adicional de la conducta dolosa del gobierno
norteamericano.

La solidaridad logr� sacarlos del "hueco"
La solidaridad lograr� liberarlos

denounced and stated he would not recognize due to his political perspective 
on the colonial reality of Puerto Rico and his refusal to recognize US 
hegemony over Puerto Rico.  The parole was also a ridiculous and unjust set 
of rules.

Various Organizations in Puerto Rico are making a call for a support picket 
in front of the Federal Court tomorrow April 14th, 2003 at 12pm.

Please be on the look out for More information.

San Juan, Puerto Rico- Alguaciles Federales arrestaron al compa�ero Antonio 
Camacho en la ma�ana de hoy y lo mantienen incomunicado en la C�rcel Federal 
en Guaynabo. Se est� convocando a un piquete en solidaridad con el compa�ero 
a las 12 del mediodia frente al Tribunal Federal donde se celebrar� una 
vista de sentencia en su contra.

A eso de las 2:30 de la tarde dos alguaciles federales se presentaron a la 
casa del hermano del compa�ero con una orden de arresto por alegadamente 
violar las condiciones de su probatoria. Antonio Camacho fu� acusado y 
condenado de transportar 7.5 millones de d�lares en Hartford Connecticut y 
fu� encarcelado en marzo de 1998 a pesar de insistir en que no obedeceria 
las condiciones de su liberaci�n. El compa�ero fu� liberado a principios del 
2002 bajo las mismas condiciones de probatoria.

El compa�ero ha insistido en las vistas de probatoria que no tiene el mas 
minimo inter�s en respetar las injustas condiciones que les est�n 
imponiendo. A pesar de esto los federales insisten en liberar al compa�ero e 
imponerles condiciones sumamente injustas para un prisionero pol�tico como 
reportarse semanalmente ante alguaciles federales, inhibirse de participar 
de actividades pol�ticas y no reunirse con otros compa�eros que han estado 
presos por luchar por la independencia de Puerto Rico. Estas condiciones han 
sido impuestas a otros ex-prisioneros pol�ticos y tienen el objetivo de 
detener la participaci�n de estos en la lucha del pueblo de Puerto Rico.

Convocamos a todos aquellos solidarios con el compa�ero a que se den cita 
frente a la Corte Federal ma�ana lunes 13 de abril de 2003.

http://ProLibertadWeb.tripod.com

Young people play a pivotal role in the organization and growth of National 
Liberation struggles and the support movements for their Political 
Prisoners!!  It has been the efforts of young people, organizing and 
educating within their schools and communities, that has led to a mass 
popularization of movements and mass consciousness raising about political 
issues that have significant impacts on their communities.

Now more than ever there is an urgent need to organize within the Puerto 
Rican community; the current political climate is both a repressive and 
dangerous one.  There is no way to predict how this climate might effect the 
work to free our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, the Vieques struggle and 
the many other movements for freedom and peace.

It is time for young people to consolidate their skills and talents to form 
a powerful movement to educate our communities about colonialism, 
militarism, our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, and how repression/this 
upcoming war might effect our communities.

To address this need, ProLibertad is forming a Youth/Student Network to 
create a coalition of individuals and organizations to commit to educating 
and mobilizing for the support of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, the 
Puerto Rican national Liberation struggle, and all other social justice 
movements.  As always, in unity there is strength, strength allows us to 
struggle, and struggle leads to liberation.

ProLibertad is calling all Youth and Young adult Activists to come together 
to form a Network of  Activists that are interested in supporting the Puerto 
Rican Political Prisoners, the Vieques struggle, and the movement to free 
Puerto Rico!!

Youth and Young Adults are key in these struggles!!  It is time to UNITE, 
educate, and mobilize!!

If you are interested in working with the Network and helping to put 
together several of our Kick-off events (a few activities and a major 
conference in November 2003), then please contact us at:

Young people play a pivotal role in the organization and growth of National 
Liberation struggles and the support movements for their Political 
Prisoners!!  It has been the efforts of young people, organizing and 
educating within their schools and communities, that has led to a mass 
popularization of movements and mass consciousness raising about political 
issues that have significant impacts on their communities.

Now more than ever there is an urgent need to organize within the Puerto 
Rican community; the current political climate is both a repressive and 
dangerous one.  There is no way to predict how this climate might effect the 
work to free our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, the Vieques struggle and 
the many other movements for freedom and peace.

It is time for young people to consolidate their skills and talents to form 
a powerful movement to educate our communities about colonialism, 
militarism, our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, and how repression/this 
upcoming war might effect our communities.

EMERGENCY PROTEST!! NO U.S. WAR ON CUBA! NOW IS THE TIME TO STAND IN 
SOLIDARITY WITH CUBA!!

Cuban Mission to the UN  Corner of 37th Street &amp; Lexington Avenue. New York 
City
SATURDAY, MAY 17, 2003 12 noon - 6 PM

Right-wing opponents of the Cuban Revolution have called for a
demonstration at the Cuban Mission for 1:00 PM Saturday, May 17.
These organizations � part and parcel of a four-decades long
attempt by Washington, DC to destabilize and destroy the Cuban
government and its example of social justice and
internationalism � feel wind in their sails with the stepped-up
provocations by the Bush Administration against the small island
and its mighty international example. In the past weeks we have
seen a highly orchestrated campaign of disinformation and
demonization launched by big-business politicians and their
media. We need money for jobs, schools, hospitals and other
desperately needed programs, NOT war on the Cuban people.

A day of Unity in the Community to Bring the Troops Home! Labor Salutes 
Youth!!  Jobs Not War!! End the Poverty Draft!!

Bush has asked Congress for a $75 billion war down payment. In New York, 
Pataki and Bloomberg make this possible by laying off teachers and public 
workers by the thousands. Schools, health and job programs are cut, tuition 
and the transit fare goes up.  Youth deserve education, jobs, recreation and 
healthcare.  Not an early death on a foreign battlefield.  When the troops 
that survive make it back, many will face unemployment, cutbacks and the 
possible destruction of affirmative action; they will face a dramatic 
increase in prison population and the new dangers of the Patriot Act, 
including the suppression of the rights of immigrant families.

Uptown Youth for Peace &amp; Justice and the United New York Black Radical 
Congress call on all young people, workers, teachers and students, union and 
community members, peace-loving families to come out on the International 
Working People�s Holiday, May Day, to celebrate our spirit and future.  This 
will be a festive day. There will be live Hip-Hop, Salsa, Merengue, R&amp;B, 
Folk &amp; Rock music. There will be a Street Fair where community organizations 
and unions can bring their literature and set up tables. There will be 
children�s games and mural painting for families. A day of culture, 
celebration and unity for the cause of  peace and justice.

We call for endorsements and support in building this community festival, 
including financial and in-kind contributions.

Friends &amp; Supporters,

Quilombo NYC will be throwing a dance party to raise funds
for Quilombo Summer 2003 a popular education program for
working class &amp; poor youth of color living in NYC.

Please come through ready to dance and make donations
on Saturday May 31, 2003 at 10 pm in The Brecht Forum
located at 122 West 27th St. on the 10th Floor.

Our mission is to provide opportunities for low-income youth
of color to engage in dialogue and action towards a more
socially just world, and in order to do that we need to
provide youth with the financial resources to choose a
program like Quilombo Summer instead of having to rely
on summer jobs that are disappearing or don't move
young people towards social responsibility.

As we are planning this upcoming summer program news
of the budget cuts and their effects on the youth of
this city during the upcoming months and years has
become more critical.  NYC Summer Youth Employment
Program (SYEP) has been cut from as high as 50,000
jobs a few years ago to 17,000 with the risk of
Gov. Pataki cutting another 12,000 leaving only
5,000 opportunities for our youth this summer.
[see attached article.]

We understand these attacks on vital programs
to be a clear indication of the lack of regard
for the lives of working class &amp; poor people
of color in NYC.  We anticipate an increased
level of targetting by enforcement agencies
as our communities struggle to survive this
period of Bloomberg/Pataki Economics.

How often do jails replace schools
and bars replace books in our society?

Please come out &amp; support us in our efforts to work with youth
to broaden the base of young people working for social justice
in New York City.

OneLove,
Fernando Reals
Quilombo NYC


P.S. To Make Tax-Deductible Contributions Please Send Checks
     Or Money Orders To Quilombo NYC c/o The Brecht Forum
     122 West 27th St. 10th Floor New York, NY 10001
     Please Write 'Quilombo Summer' in the memo/purpose line.
     Thanks In Advance!

Friends &amp; Supporters,

Quilombo NYC will be throwing a dance party to raise funds
for Quilombo Summer 2003 a popular education program for
working class &amp; poor youth of color living in NYC.

Please come through ready to dance and make donations
on Saturday May 31, 2003 at 10 pm in The Brecht Forum
located at 122 West 27th St. on the 10th Floor.

Our mission is to provide opportunities for low-income youth
of color to engage in dialogue and action towards a more
socially just world, and in order to do that we need to
provide youth with the financial resources to choose a
program like Quilombo Summer instead of having to rely
on summer jobs that are disappearing or don't move
young people towards social responsibility.

As we are planning this upcoming summer program news
of the budget cuts and their effects on the youth of
this city during the upcoming months and years has
become more critical.  NYC Summer Youth Employment
Program (SYEP) has been cut from as high as 50,000
jobs a few years ago to 17,000 with the risk of
Gov. Pataki cutting another 12,000 leaving only
5,000 opportunities for our youth this summer.
[see attached article.]

We understand these attacks on vital programs
to be a clear indication of the lack of regard
for the lives of working class &amp; poor people
of color in NYC.  We anticipate an increased
level of targetting by enforcement agencies
as our communities struggle to survive this
period of Bloomberg/Pataki Economics.

How often do jails replace schools
and bars replace books in our society?

Please come out &amp; support us in our efforts to work with youth
to broaden the base of young people working for social justice
in New York City.

OneLove,
Fernando Reals
Quilombo NYC


P.S. To Make Tax-Deductible Contributions Please Send Checks
     Or Money Orders To Quilombo NYC c/o The Brecht Forum
     122 West 27th St. 10th Floor New York, NY 10001
     Please Write 'Quilombo Summer' in the memo/purpose line.
     Thanks In Advance!

Grant�s Tomb 122nd St &amp; Riverside Drive

Initiated by: Latinos Unidos/as Contra La Guerra, Uptown Youth for Peace &amp;
Justice, Black Radical Congress, Northern Manhattan Neighbors for Peace &amp;
Justice.  To endorse or pledge donations call: 212-642-1185,

A day of Unity in the Community to Bring the Troops Home! Labor Salutes
Youth!!  Jobs Not War!! End the Poverty Draft!!

Bush has asked Congress for a $75 billion war down payment. In New York,
Pataki and Bloomberg make this possible by laying off teachers and public
workers by the thousands. Schools, health and job programs are cut, tuition
and the transit fare goes up.  Youth deserve education, jobs, recreation and
healthcare.  Not an early death on a foreign battlefield.  When the troops
that survive make it back, many will face unemployment, cutbacks and the
possible destruction of affirmative action; they will face a dramatic
increase in prison population and the new dangers of the Patriot Act,
including the suppression of the rights of immigrant families.

Uptown Youth for Peace &amp; Justice and the United New York Black Radical
Congress call on all young people, workers, teachers and students, union and
community members, peace-loving families to come out on the International
Working People�s Holiday, May Day, to celebrate our spirit and future.  This
will be a festive day. There will be live Hip-Hop, Salsa, Merengue, R&amp;B,
Folk &amp; Rock music. There will be a Street Fair where community organizations
and unions can bring their literature and set up tables. There will be
children�s games and mural painting for families. A day of culture,
celebration and unity for the cause of  peace and justice.

We call for endorsements and support in building this community festival,
including financial and in-kind contributions.

Friends &amp; Supporters,

Quilombo NYC will be throwing a dance party to raise funds
for Quilombo Summer 2003 a popular education program for
working class &amp; poor youth of color living in NYC.

Please come through ready to dance and make donations
on Saturday May 31, 2003 at 10 pm in The Brecht Forum
located at 122 West 27th St. on the 10th Floor.

Our mission is to provide opportunities for low-income youth
of color to engage in dialogue and action towards a more
socially just world, and in order to do that we need to
provide youth with the financial resources to choose a
program like Quilombo Summer instead of having to rely
on summer jobs that are disappearing or don't move
young people towards social responsibility.

As we are planning this upcoming summer program news
of the budget cuts and their effects on the youth of
this city during the upcoming months and years has
become more critical.  NYC Summer Youth Employment
Program (SYEP) has been cut from as high as 50,000
jobs a few years ago to 17,000 with the risk of
Gov. Pataki cutting another 12,000 leaving only
5,000 opportunities for our youth this summer.
[see attached article.]

We understand these attacks on vital programs
to be a clear indication of the lack of regard
for the lives of working class &amp; poor people
of color in NYC.  We anticipate an increased
level of targetting by enforcement agencies
as our communities struggle to survive this
period of Bloomberg/Pataki Economics.

How often do jails replace schools
and bars replace books in our society?

Please come out &amp; support us in our efforts to work with youth
to broaden the base of young people working for social justice
in New York City.

OneLove,
Fernando Reals

Vieques civil disobedient Ismael Guadalupe Torres is placed in the hole

San Juan, 2 June (EFE).-

All Puerto Rico with Vieques Committee denounced today that the US 
authorities in the US
Federal Jail in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico have placed college student Ismael 
Guadalupe Torres in the hole.  Guadalupe Torres is jailed because he is a 
civil disobedient that trespassed into  Navy restricted land in Vieques, 
Puerto Rico

Jos� Che Paralitici and Josefina Pantojas, spokespersons for the Committee, 
denounced that on Friday prison officials told Guadalupe Torres that they 
knew that he was trying to enter a cell phone into the prison.  Paralitici 
and Pantojas said that Guadalupe Torres called his father Ismael Guadalupe 
Ortiz and told him what had happened. A little while later prison officials 
removed Ismael from his cell and placed him in the hole. Sunday when his 
mother Norma Torres went to visit him accompanied by his fiance and his 
brother they observed Ismael in the orange uniform utilized by those who are 
placed in the hole.

"We know that he is in the hole with two other persons.  That he is locked 
up for 23 hours  and that he is sleeping on the floor.  He does not have 
access to phone calls and he is at the mercy of the prison guards," 
denounced Paralitici and Pantoja is a written press release.  "We hold the 
prison officials responsible for his custody accountable for what might 
occur to Ismael Guadalupe Torres."  Guadalupe Torres was condemned to a 140 
day sentence for trespassing on the lands that the US Navy used for their 
maneuvers.

As a demonstration of its solidarity The All Puerto Rico with Vieques 
Committee will hold a picket tomorrow June 3, 2003, at 5:00 PM in front of 
the US Federal Jail in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.

Brothers and Sisters:

As you all know, the last civil disobedient that was arrested during the 
last bombing practices in Vieques, Ismael Guadalupe Torres, remains in the 
Federal Prison in Puerto Rico.  Ismael who is a member of the Vieques youth 
organization Vieques Youth United (JUVU-Juventud Viequense Unida) has been 
arrested 3 times and they are keeping him prisoner at this federal prison.

In the last couple of days Maelito has been subjected to the rage of some of 
his jailers.  First when the May 1st incidents occurred with the burning of 
the trucks and the use of sledgehammers, one of the prison guards blatantly 
provoked him leading to a strong exchange and debate.  Following this 
situation Maelito communicates with me indicating that he is being accused 
of having a phone conversation with his girfriend where they supposedly 
spoke about smuggling him a telephone into the prison.  After he spoke with 
me they put him the hole.  This happened immediately after he spoke with me. 
  Another inmate that shares the cell with Maelito was also taken to the 
hole and accused of being an accomplice.

Since this past Friday night he has been sleeping on the floor.  He is not 
being given his mail.  Many of his letters have been returned to the 
senders.  His telephone calls have been restricted to one phone call which 
he can make Thursday of this week.  They have also eliminated visists from 
his family.  We will not be able to see him.  It is obvious that what they 
want to do is to isolate him and to prevent any communication with us.

As we all know, many of these Federal employees are sympathetic to the most 
right-wing sectors in Puerto Rico.  Many have gotten their jobs as jailers, 
prison guards, as a result of the interevention and influence of a 
politician in the right-wing of the New Progressive Party (PNP).  This 
accounts for the cruel and inhuman treatment by some of the prison guards 
against those of us who have been jailed for civil disobedience.

We are making a call to everyone to send letters to Ismaelito at the prison. 
  They open all his letters and in this way the prison guards will read 
them.  While preparations for his release on Tuesday, June 10th continue, on 
Monday, June 9th, there will be vigil at the camps set up by the Federal 
Prison.  Some of us will remain there overnight to recieve and welcome the 
last civil disobedient in the morning.

You can write to Ismaelito at the following address:

Ismael Guadalupe Torres
21644-069
MDC  Guaynabo
P.O. BOX  2147
S.J., PUerto Rico 00922-2147

In solidarity,

Since this past Friday night he has been sleeping on the floor.  He is not
being given his mail.  Many of his letters have been returned to the
senders.  His telephone calls have been restricted to one phone call which
he can make Thursday of this week.  They have also eliminated visists from
his family.  We will not be able to see him.  It is obvious that what they
want to do is to isolate him and to prevent any communication with us.

As we all know, many of these Federal employees are sympathetic to the most
right-wing sectors in Puerto Rico.  Many have gotten their jobs as jailers,
prison guards, as a result of the interevention and influence of a
politician in the right-wing of the New Progressive Party (PNP).  This
accounts for the cruel and inhuman treatment by some of the prison guards
against those of us who have been jailed for civil disobedience.

We are making a call to everyone to send letters to Ismaelito at the prison.
  They open all his letters and in this way the prison guards will read
them.  While preparations for his release on Tuesday, June 10th continue, on
Monday, June 9th, there will be vigil at the camps set up by the Federal
Prison.  Some of us will remain there overnight to recieve and welcome the

Vieques civil disobedient Ismael Guadalupe Torres is placed in the hole

San Juan, 2 June (EFE).-

All Puerto Rico with Vieques Committee denounced today that the US
authorities in the US
Federal Jail in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico have placed college student Ismael
Guadalupe Torres in the hole.  Guadalupe Torres is jailed because he is a
civil disobedient that trespassed into  Navy restricted land in Vieques,
Puerto Rico

Jos� Che Paralitici and Josefina Pantojas, spokespersons for the Committee,
denounced that on Friday prison officials told Guadalupe Torres that they
knew that he was trying to enter a cell phone into the prison.  Paralitici
and Pantojas said that Guadalupe Torres called his father Ismael Guadalupe
Ortiz and told him what had happened. A little while later prison officials
removed Ismael from his cell and placed him in the hole. Sunday when his
mother Norma Torres went to visit him accompanied by his fiance and his
brother they observed Ismael in the orange uniform utilized by those who are
placed in the hole.

"We know that he is in the hole with two other persons.  That he is locked
up for 23 hours  and that he is sleeping on the floor.  He does not have
access to phone calls and he is at the mercy of the prison guards,"
denounced Paralitici and Pantoja is a written press release.  "We hold the
prison officials responsible for his custody accountable for what might
occur to Ismael Guadalupe Torres."  Guadalupe Torres was condemned to a 140
day sentence for trespassing on the lands that the US Navy used for their
maneuvers.

As a demonstration of its solidarity The All Puerto Rico with Vieques
Committee will hold a picket tomorrow June 3, 2003, at 5:00 PM in front of
the US Federal Jail in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.

Brothers and Sisters:

As you all know, the last civil disobedient that was arrested during the
last bombing practices in Vieques, Ismael Guadalupe Torres, remains in the
Federal Prison in Puerto Rico.  Ismael who is a member of the Vieques youth
organization Vieques Youth United (JUVU-Juventud Viequense Unida) has been
arrested 3 times and they are keeping him prisoner at this federal prison.

In the last couple of days Maelito has been subjected to the rage of some of
his jailers.  First when the May 1st incidents occurred with the burning of
the trucks and the use of sledgehammers, one of the prison guards blatantly
provoked him leading to a strong exchange and debate.  Following this
situation Maelito communicates with me indicating that he is being accused
of having a phone conversation with his girfriend where they supposedly
spoke about smuggling him a telephone into the prison.  After he spoke with
me they put him the hole.  This happened immediately after he spoke with me.
  Another inmate that shares the cell with Maelito was also taken to the
hole and accused of being an accomplice.

Since this past Friday night he has been sleeping on the floor.  He is not
being given his mail.  Many of his letters have been returned to the
senders.  His telephone calls have been restricted to one phone call which
he can make Thursday of this week.  They have also eliminated visists from
his family.  We will not be able to see him.  It is obvious that what they
want to do is to isolate him and to prevent any communication with us.

As we all know, many of these Federal employees are sympathetic to the most

25 June, 2003  Press Release

FBI arrest Vieques leader, Nilda Medina

Shortly before 5AM today, five agents of the FBI entered the home of Nilda 
Medina and Robert Rabin, members of the Committee for the Rescue and 
Development of Vieques (CRDV) with a warrant to arrest Medina, acusing her 
of violation of Title 18 of the Federal Code for "damage to property''.  
Teodoro Lebron was the agent in charge of the operation that included 
members of the Puerto Rican police.  The arrest order was signed by 
Magistrate Aida Delgado and Special Agent of the FBI, Carlos Rodr�guez.

Members of the CRDV and the Vieques community denounced the arresta as an 
abuse against a woman who has been a example of this struggle for peace and 
made great efforts over the past four years to maintain the non violent 
nature of the struggle that gained the respect of people throughout the 
world.

This arrest comes just four days after FBI agents entered the facilities of 
the CRDV in the Peace and Justice Camp, with a search warrant to find "maps, 
photos, phone and address lists or other materials as evidence of the 
commission of a crime."

Nilda Medina is recognized as one of the principal leaders of the Vieques 
struggle during more than two decades and is a founding member of the CRDV.  
During actions of civil disobedience, Medina was arrested on May 4th, 2000 
and again in June of that year when she participated in the first brigade to 
return to the bombing zone after the "removal'' of the Civil Disobedience 
Camps from the military area.

Spokespersons for the CRDV also denounce the arrest of others in Vieques and 
in the main island that could take place today and emphasized that the group 
continues its plan to hold a Peopl's Assembly this Thursday at 7PM in the 
Count Mirasol Fort on Vieques to discuss strategies for this new phase of 
the struggle for decontamination, return of the lands to the people and 
sustainable development.

25 June, 2003  Press Release

FBI arrest Vieques leader, Nilda Medina

Shortly before 5AM today, five agents of the FBI entered the home of Nilda 
Medina and Robert Rabin, members of the Committee for the Rescue and 
Development of Vieques (CRDV) with a warrant to arrest Medina, acusing her 
of violation of Title 18 of the Federal Code for "damage to property''.  
Teodoro Lebron was the agent in charge of the operation that included 
members of the Puerto Rican police.  The arrest order was signed by 
Magistrate Aida Delgado and Special Agent of the FBI, Carlos Rodr�guez.

Members of the CRDV and the Vieques community denounced the arresta as an 
abuse against a woman who has been a example of this struggle for peace and 
made great efforts over the past four years to maintain the non violent 
nature of the struggle that gained the respect of people throughout the

EMERGENCY PROTEST FOR VIEQUES!
Monday, June 30th 4:30 P.M.
26 Federal Plaza
(lower Manhattan)
New York City

Although a small victory was achieved, the struggle for Vieques is far
from over. So long as a single U.S. military personnel is in Puerto
Rico, the oppressive yoke of U.S. colonialism will make its presence
felt.

And now, those who are responsible for the cancer and destruction that
took place for more than six decades, want to implement a policy of
reprisals on the people of Vieques. The FBI have arrested people who
have been active in the noble struggle to get the U.S. Navy to stop
its bombing destruction and withdraw from the island.

It was in Vieques where all U.S. wars since World War II, including
the invasion and conquest of Afganistan and Iraq, have been rehearsed.

Of the people of Vieques who were arrested, some have been charged
with conspiracy to destroy governemnt property, a potentially serious
charge. We have to make it clear - the real destructive criminal is
U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico. From the U.S. Navy, the FBI to U.S.
officials in Washington, they are all responsible for the
destructiveness in Vieques and all of Puerto Rico.

Please join us in an emergency picket Monday, June 30th, 4:30 P.M., at
26 Federal Plaza to support of the people of Vieques, Puerto Rico. DO
NOT let Vieques become the scene of FBI reprisals.

Transportation information: Take the IRT subway trains 6, 4, 5 to
Brooklyn Bridge or the IND subway trains "R" or "N" to City Hall.

About NYSMFP:

NYSMFP is a predominantly people of color organized
membership of activists from varied communities in New
York City with a history of mobilizing around domestic
and international struggles for economic and racial
justice.  We believe our struggles for
self-determination and resistance to imperialism are
linked to and aided by the Palestinian fight against
occupation.  We are looking forward to having Maha
Nassar and Ala Al Azzeh here speaking with our
communities first hand about the Palestinians
struggle.

About Maha Nassar:

Maha Nassar is the elected chair person of U.P.W.C.,
Union of Palestinian Womens Committees she is also
Chair Person of the Board of Trustees of the
Alternative Information Centre (co project between
Palestinian and Israeli Progressives who look for a
secular democratic State in Palestine).  She has been
a secondary school Physics teacher for 26 years and a
member of Teachers Union for the 20 past years.  Maha
Nassar is an ex-prisoner, she was in Israeli Jails
during both the first and the second Intifadas.  She
was under house arrest for 6 months during the first
Intifada.

organization doing work in West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Their main goal is to raise the awareness of women about
their social, economic and political rights, and also
to encourage women to take a role in civil society
enforcing laws that forbid discrimination against
them.  Their programs also take into consideration the
critical situation of our people under the aggressive
attacks of Israeli occupation.  Not only on
has the occupation effected our people, but also on
the infrastructure to such a degree that it brought
more responsibilities and burdens on the shoulder of
non-governmental organizations like the UPWC.

Ala Al Azzeh is currently pursuing an MA in
International Studies from Birzeit University and
works as a math and science teacher at Al Ezzeriyeh

PARTY/FORUM

We Are Our Own Liberators:  Selected Prison Writings of Jalil Muntaqim with 
Asha Bandele, Antoinette Bottom* &amp; Others TBA

Join us to celebrate the long-awaited publication of prison writings by 
former Black Panther Party/Black Liberation Army member Jalil Muntaqim, one 
of the world's longest held political prisoners. Imprisoned since 1971, as a 
result of the American government's campaign to crush domestic opposition, 
this collection spans his 31 years of prison writings and outlines his major 
theoretical contributions to the Black Liberation and New-Afrikan 
Independence Movements. It includes "We Are Our Own Liberators," "Africans 
In The Diaspora," "On the Black Liberation Army," "A Case Against Domestic 
Neo-Colonialism," "For The Liberation of North America," "National Strategy 
for the Front for the Liberation of the New Afrikan Nation," "Handbook for 
Revolutionary Nationalist Cadres," "The National and International Struggle 
Toward a New Global Revolutionary Pan-Afrikan Strategy," and his 1975 
sentencing statement.

Asha Bandele is an editor at Essence magazine, published author of The

BETWEEN 6TH AVE. AND VARICK (7TH AVENUES)
Tickets are $9.  Proceeds benefit the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, Black 
August and political prisoners.

If you haven't yet seen the Weather Underground movie, or if you've seen it 
and want to see it again, please go to the Film Forum showing on FRIDAY, 
JULY 11, at either 6:00 or 8:00 -- the proceeds from those showings will be 
donated to the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement for their work to support and 
win release of political prisoners (and especially for their annual hip-hop 
concert, Black August www.blackaugust.com.) The theater holds 150 people per 
show, and the more seats are filled, the more money we will raise for MXGM 
and their important work to free political prisoners. The film itself makes 
no mention of all the political prisoners from the Black Panther Party, 
Black Liberation Army and white anti-imperialist groups still inside after 
30 years. But the film-maker helped arrange these two benefit screenings.

Please circulate this message to all your friends and lists in New York, so 
that we can use the film to generate support for political prisoners and the 
struggle for Black liberation.

JULY 11, at either 6:00 or 8:00 -- the proceeds from those showings will be
donated to the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement for their work to support and
win release of political prisoners (and especially for their annual hip-hop
concert, Black August www.blackaugust.com.) The theater holds 150 people per
show, and the more seats are filled, the more money we will raise for MXGM
and their important work to free political prisoners. The film itself makes
no mention of all the political prisoners from the Black Panther Party,
Black Liberation Army and white anti-imperialist groups still inside after
30 years. But the film-maker helped arrange these two benefit screenings.

Please circulate this message to all your friends and lists in New York, so
that we can use the film to generate support for political prisoners and the
struggle for Black liberation.

About NYSMFP:

NYSMFP is a predominantly people of color organized
membership of activists from varied communities in New
York City with a history of mobilizing around domestic
and international struggles for economic and racial
justice.  We believe our struggles for
self-determination and resistance to imperialism are
linked to and aided by the Palestinian fight against
occupation.  We are looking forward to having Maha
Nassar and Ala Al Azzeh here speaking with our
communities first hand about the Palestinians
struggle.

About Maha Nassar:

Maha Nassar is the elected chair person of U.P.W.C.,
Union of Palestinian Womens Committees she is also
Chair Person of the Board of Trustees of the
Alternative Information Centre (co project between
Palestinian and Israeli Progressives who look for a
secular democratic State in Palestine).  She has been
a secondary school Physics teacher for 26 years and a
member of Teachers Union for the 20 past years.  Maha
Nassar is an ex-prisoner, she was in Israeli Jails
during both the first and the second Intifadas.  She
was under house arrest for 6 months during the first
Intifada.

About the UPWC:

Union of Palestinian Womens Committees is a
grassroots or mass based women's
organization doing work in West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Their main goal is to raise the awareness of women about
their social, economic and political rights, and also
to encourage women to take a role in civil society
enforcing laws that forbid discrimination against
them.  Their programs also take into consideration the
critical situation of our people under the aggressive
attacks of Israeli occupation.  Not only on
has the occupation effected our people, but also on
the infrastructure to such a degree that it brought
more responsibilities and burdens on the shoulder of
non-governmental organizations like the UPWC.

Ala Al Azzeh is currently pursuing an MA in
International Studies from Birzeit University and
works as a math and science teacher at Al Ezzeriyeh

A call to Rutgers students and student organizations:

July 14, 2003

You may have heard of the recent attacks upon New Jersey Solidarity, a
registered student organization at the University, which is planning to
host the Third North American Student Conference of the Palestine
Solidarity Movement on October 10-12, 2003, at the Douglass College
Center. The conference, which has been held in past years at the
University of California- Berkeley and the University of Michigan- Ann
Arbor, brings together hundreds of activists for educational sessions,
activist skill-sharings and strategy meetings.

This year, however, the conference is under attack. This attack, forwarded
by State Senate President John Bennett and Governor Jim McGreevey, targets
the student organizers for their political positions, and threatens to
cancel the conference simply because state legislators disagree with the
student organizers' politics - a clear threat to freedom of speech and
association. The New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union
has expressed its deep concerns about this overt involvement of state
officials in suppressing student free speech and free expression.

To date, the University administration has held fast to principles of free
speech and free association, stating that the specific political views of
the organizers are irrelevant to the broader question of student free
speech. As students and organizers, we are all under threat whenever the
specter of official state censorship at our University is raised. Please
sign the following appeals to President McCormick and Governor McGreevey
to defend student free speech and free association. Our University and
state-level officials must be held accountable for actions that attempt to
stifle student expression and organizing!

Dear President McCormick,

As student leaders, student organizations, and active students at Rutgers
University, we are writing to call upon you to hold firm to the
University's principles of student free speech and freedom of association.
The recent attacks upon New Jersey Solidarity's planned Third North
American Student Conference of the Palestine Solidarity Movement by press
and government officials have raised the disturbing specter of official
state censorship on our campus. The call by State Senate President John
Bennett for the cancellation of the conference and the comments by
Governor Jim McGreevey that he is "concerned" about "balance" at the
conference indicate an unhealthy level of interest in student activities
that clearly fall under the banner of free speech and association. In
addition, the comments by Micah Rasmussen, McGreevey's spokesman, reported
in the Press of Atlantic City, reveal an even more worrisome approach on
the part of state officials. Rasmussen stated that McGreevey considers the
registered student organization in question "abhorrent" and that the state
government was investigating "whether or not they have a history of
violence;" he also indicated that the state government had checked, but
failed to find the organization on a list of "suspected terrorist
organizations." At a time when we are facing increased attacks on civil
rights and liberties, it is imperative that our academic institutions not
become a venue for political interrogation and persecution.

McGreevey's planned meeting with you is inappropriate and troubling; that
the governor of the state of New Jersey sees fit to involve himself in
purely internal University matters, including student organizations and
their activities - especially as the University's budget is slashed -
indicates a fundamental lack of respect for academic freedom and freedom
of association.

As students, we recognize that a threat to one student's freedom of speech
and association is a threat to us all. We represent many backgrounds and
causes, yet we are united in our belief that our University may only
thrive as an academic center when freedom of debate and discourse is
respected. Our campus should be an open site for discussion and dialogue -
not a place where all student expression requires state sanction. Such a
concept is an affront not only to any concept of a university, but also to
the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

Please continue to uphold the University's position supporting student
free speech and rebuff the state government's attempt to interfere in
internal University matters and student political work.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Signatories

Dear Governor McGreevey,

As student leaders, student organizations, and active students at Rutgers
University, we are writing to call upon you to reject attacks upon student
free speech and freedom of expression. The recent attacks upon New Jersey
Solidarity's planned Third North American Student Conference of the
Palestine Solidarity Movement by press and government officials have
raised the disturbing specter of official state censorship on our campus.
The call by State Senate President John Bennett for the cancellation of
the conference and by your spokesperson that you are "concerned" about
"balance" at the conference indicate an unhealthy level of interest in
student activities that clearly fall under the banner of free speech and
association.

The comments by Micah Rasmussen, your spokesman, reported in the Press of
Atlantic City, reveal an even more worrisome approach. Rasmussen stated
that you consider the registered student organization in question
"abhorrent" and that the state government was investigating "whether or
not they have a history of violence;" he also indicated that the state
government had checked, but failed to find the organization on a list of
"suspected terrorist organizations." At a time when we are facing
increased attacks on civil rights and liberties, it is imperative that our
academic institutions not become a venue for political interrogation and
persecution.

The fact that you have sought a meeting with Rutgers University President
Richard McCormick rather than recognizing this as a clear issue of freedom
of speech raises very severe questions about your respect as a governor
for the principles of higher education and the university community, and
more fundamental questions about your respect for the First Amendment. The
political activities and events of student organizations should be no more
subject to review by the state governor than any other political events -
any indication to the contrary indicates approval of official state
censorship.

We are calling upon you to reject political baiting and attempts at
repression of student organizations and the student community at Rutgers
University. It is not the place of the state governor to interfere with
the operations of the University, nor is it the place of the governor to
approve or disapprove of student organizing. Our University is an
excellent university because it is committed to principles of a fine
university - including those of an open campus environment, debate,
dialogue and discussion. Please step back from your comments that you are
"investigating" New Jersey Solidarity. Political organizations need not be
"investigated," and your spokesperson's comments are chillingly
reminiscent of the McCarthy period.

It is imperative that our state government respect and recognize our
rights. Please respect the University's independence.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Signatories

<pre>August 5, 2003 Tuesday Final
Edition

HEADLINE: American volunteers visited Cuba illegally to make a point

SOURCE: Osprey News Network

BYLINE: Tony Ricciuto

DATELINE: FORT ERIE

FORT ERIE - About 80 Americans, members of the volunteer organization
Venceremos Brigade, returned to the United States Monday after
spending two weeks  in Cuba.

   They arrived in Fort Erie about 8 a.m., and after listening to
speeches in front of the Mather Arch, walked across the Peace Bridge
not knowing what to expect once they reached the other side.

   The U. S. government requires travellers to obtain a U.S. Treasury
Department Licence before going to Cuba. Members of the Brigade
refuse to get the  licence as a protest against the travel
restrictions.

   "Some of us are nervous," said Sierra Thaibinh, 29, who lives in
California. "We are about to head back home and we are here to take a
visible stand. We know our rights and the rights of Cuban people."

   Thaibinh thanked those Canadians who turned out to give them words
of encouragement before they returned home.

   One of those supporters was Niagara Centre MPP Peter Kormos, who
noted that some causes are worth the risk of going to jail if it
means restoring national and international relationships.

   "These people are engaging in a clear act of civil disobedience by
declaring they have been to Cuba and they are inviting arrest and
charges," explained Kormos, an NDP MPP. "It's important to support
them."

   Kormos didn't expect any of the travellers to actually be arrested
when they returned home because the government would not want to make
martyrs of them.

   Kormos noted the law is from another era and should be changed.

   "The blockade of Cuba by the United States is barbaric and
ineffective," said Kormos. "An open relationship with Cuba can be
productive."

   This was the 34th contingent of the Venceremos Brigade to visit
Cuba.

   Kathe Karlson, from New York City, said the volunteers helped to
paint a health clinic and worked side-by-side with Cubans.

   "It was a wonderful experience," said Karlson. "It's very
important to make friends with people around the world. As Americans,
we want to be able to travel without restrictions and find out the
truth for ourselves."

   Bonnie Massey, 22, also from New York City, said Cubans are a
friendly people and the travel restriction just doesn't make any
sense. Cuba's economy  is suffering because the United States has had
a blockade in place for  more than 40 years.

   "This has been a life-changing experience for many of us. We got
to learn many things that we don't get to learn at home. It makes us
better people," said Massey.

   Members of the Brigade walked across the Peace Bridge in small
groups so they wouldn't interfere with traffic, and so they could be
processed faster once they reached the American side.

   There were no reports of anyone being arrested or unduly detained.


                            Buffalo News (New York)

                      August 4, 2003 Monday

HEADLINE: RETURNEES TO U.S. DEFY CUBA TRAVEL BAN

BYLINE: MARK SOMMER; News Staff Reporter

   More than 80 Americans returning from Cuba via Toronto this morning
defied U.S. travel restrictions by walking across the Peace Bridge.

    The crossing occurred without incident after arrangements were
made in Washington with customs officials.

    The contingent consisted of members of the Venceremos Brigade, a
Cuba friendship and solidarity association, who spent two weeks near
Havana. The protest was intended to draw attention to new Treasury
Department restrictions that have eliminated People to People
Educational Exchange licenses,  the second largest category for Cuban
travel after family visits,and to the four-decades-long economic
embargo.

    The group, which included about 25 high school students, had
spent the past two weeks working alongside Cubans to paint a
medicalcenter and do other manual work near Havana.

    "The embargo and travel ban policies of our country really hurts
them, as well as hurting us," said Bonnie Massie of New York
City. "It denies them a lot of material necessity, and it denies us a
the opportunity to learn about a whole other people."

    John Madsen, chief inspector for the Bureau of Customs and Border
Protection, said arrangements were made in advance with authorities in
Washington, D.C., to allow the protesters to return without arrest.

    "This case was referred to the Office of Foreign Assets Control,
which is a part of the Treasury Department, and in this instance they
were satisfied with the level of inspection we were doing," Madsen
said.

    In 2001, an estimated 140,000 Americans -- 60,000 illegally --
visited communist Cuba, according to the Treasury Department. That
same year, the House of Representatives voted, 232-186, to retire
restrictions on travel to  Cuba, but the Senate never voted on it.

    Earlier this year, the United States and some human rights
groups --including Amnesty International -- criticized Cuba over its
human rights record after the government imposed long prison
sentences on 75 dissidents and executed three people who tried to
hijack a boat to flee the island nation.

    But traveler Tony Ryan of Washington, D.C., suggested the United
States should be careful about pointing fingers at others.

    "People who raise that issue in the U.S. should look at the
treatment of U.S. prisoners in Cuba's Guantanamo Bay, where they are
being denied fair treatment. Or just look at the streets of the
United States and the social injustice and lack of human rights for
all kinds of people," he said.

HEADLINE: VISITORS TO CUBA PLAN PEACE BRIDGE PROTEST
CROSSING

BYLINE: MARK SOMMER; News Staff Reporter

   On Monday morning, 85 visitors to Cuba are scheduled to publicly
defy a Bush administration travel ban by walking across the Peace
Bridge to re-enter the United States.

    The contingent are members of the Venceremos Brigade, a Cuba
friendship association that organized the trip. They flew to Cuba
through Toronto, which unlike the United States has no travel
restrictions to the socialist island. After a scheduled return to
Toronto Sunday night, buses are to deposit  the group at U.S. Customs
on the Fort Erie side of the bridge. They plan to cross  at 8:30
a.m., and then rally in Front Park.

    The group seeks to draw attention to recently tightened travel
restrictions.

    In March, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets
Control announced the elimination of People to People Educational
Exchange licenses, the second largest category for Cuban travel after
family visits. More than  1,200 people who traveled to Cuba illegally
in the past year also have been  notified they will have to pay fines.

    "We are doing this because we think people should not be harassed
or fined for traveling to Cuba," said Ann Sparanese, spokeswoman for
Venceremos Brigade. "And we don't think people should have to sneak
home when they travel  there. It's our constitutional right to travel
and see Cuba for ourselves."

    For four decades, the United States has enforced an embargo on
goods into Cuba, which critics consider a relic of the Cold War. It
was slightly loosened in 2000.

    The Bush administration, which enjoys strong support from the
Cuban exile community in Miami, signaled it was getting tougher on
Cuban visitors in its first year by tripling the number of people
penalized with fines, compared with the last year of the Clinton
administration.

    Clinton went to bat for musician Ry Cooder in the waning days of
his administration, so that Cooder could return to Cuba and share in
profits from what would become the popular "Buena Vista Social Club"
recordings.

    Cuba received international criticism earlier this year for
imposing long prison sentences on 75 dissidents.

    Dennis Hays, former ambassasor to Surinam and executive vice
president of the largest anti-Castro organization, the Cuban American
National Foundation, applauds the tougher travel restrictions and
scoffed at the Venceremos  Brigade's planned action.

    "If the Venceremos Brigade wants to help people of Cuba, they
should work to get rid of this failed regime and allow the Cuban
people to decide their own future," Hays said.

    "People worry a lot about their rights, but don't worry about the
responsibilities. The (Venceremos Brigade) should look carefully and
see if they are helping or hurting the citizens of Cuba through their
action."

    The Venceremos Brigade began in 1969, when hundreds of young
people expressed solidarity with the Cuban government by helping in
the sugar harvest. Annual, unlicensed work trips have followed. This
year's visit saw  brigade members, ranging in age from high school
students to seniors, work side by side with Cubans for two weeks to
renovate a health clinic near Havana.

    In 2001, an estimated 140,000 Americans -- 60,000 illegally --
visited Cuba according to the Treasury Department. That same year,
the House of Representatives voted 232-186 to retire Cuba travel
restrictions, but  the Senate never voted on it.

    The travel challenge is a joint project with Pastors for Peace,
which delivered a caravan of food and medicine into Cuba through
Mexico last month. Representatives will be on hand at Front Park
welcome the group, along  with the Western New York Peace Center,
Buffalo State Students for Peace and the  anti-war group, A.N.S.W.E.R.

island

DATELINE: FORT ERIE

FORT ERIE - Long weekend traffic may not be the only thing slowing
down the return trip to the United States for 80 American travellers
Monday.

   The group, members of the American volunteer organization the
Venceremos  Brigade, an organization whose objective is to increase
awareness of  the merits of the Castro regime in Cuba, left Toronto's
Pearson Airport July 20,  bound for Havana, Cuba. None of the members
obtained a U.S. Treasury Department licence, a document required by
U.S. citizens for travel to Cuba. All expect to  pay the price for it.

   "We've never concerned ourselves with (licences) because we don't
believe in them," said Venceremos Brigade spokesperson Ann Sparanese,
from the group's Englewood, N.J., headquarters. "This is (an act of)
civil disobedience.

   Sparanese, who travelled to Buffalo Thursday to prepare for
Monday's arrival of Brigade members from Toronto, said she doubts
there will be any real  delay at the border, but does expect
participants -- who will freely admit  travelling to Cuba without a
licence -- will find notices in the mail not long after  their return.

   "It's a currency violation, it's not about travel," she said. "It's
about money. And our intention is not to pay a fine but to challenge
the law."

   And right now, the law says Americans cannot travel to Cuba without
first obtaining a licence from the Treasury Department's Office of
Foreign Assets Control -- essentially granting the person permission
to spend U.S. greenbacks in Cuba.

   There are a number of different licences available for a myriad of
different situations, Sparanese said, but the Venceremos Brigade has
never applied for one in its 32-year history and doesn't plan to
start now.

   She said in the past, Brigade members from all walks of life have
made the roundabout trip to Cuba -- by way of Canada -- without any
fuss or penalty.

   But Helen Santek, a member of the Niagara branch of the
Canadian-Cuban Friendship Association, which will meet the Brigade at
the Peace Bridge early Monday morning, said this group of brigade
members could find themselves in a heap of trouble when they set foot
on American soil.

   "Usually, these brigades would pass back and forth without the
Treasury Department permits, but since the U.S. has now turned its
eye toward Cuba ... they (the Bush administration), are now
threatening them."

   Those threats, she said, could include detention at the border or
monetary penalties ranging from $7,500 to $25,000 US.

   "We really don't know what to expect," she said.

   Taylor Griffin, a spokesperson for the Treasury Department, said
it's unlikely Brigade members will be detained by U.S. Customs upon
their re-entry to the States, but expects they will be fined for
their actions.

   "They may hear it from customs and they'll almost definitely be
fined" he said.

   "But they aren't going to be thrown in the slammer or anything."

Venceremos Brigade Returns from Cuba
Lucy Nalpathanchil

BUFFALO 2003-08-04

The 34th contingent of the Venceremos Brigade have returned from Cuba.

About 80 Americans walked across the Peace Bridge from Fort Erie this
morning. The groups travelled from Cuba without a Treasury Department
license to challenge the U.S government's restrictions on travel to
the communist country.

The contingent was not cited by U.S Customs officials at the Peace
Bridge. Member of the group, Bob Guild, says the brigade stayed in
Cuba for two weeks and volunteered at health clinics. Guild says the
Venceremos Brigade will continue to go against U.S policy until the
ban is revoked.

"Our demand is for the United States to lift the travel ban. There
are two bills in Congress, right now, sponsored by the majority of
people in the House and the Senate. We want those bills passed. We
want an end to the travel ban."

Guild says Americans who travel to Cuba without U.S permission can
face fines of up to $55,000. He says each member of the brigade may
still face sanctions from the government for their trip.

Subject:Socialists and People's Assembly In Puerto Rico<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Socialists And The So-Called Peoples� Assembly On Status
By Jorge Farinacci

In an editorial of the newspaper Claridad, July 24-31, 2003, edition of the
paper, the leadership of the newspaper champions the position of various
sectors of the independence movement in Puerto Rico which support the
process which has begun in the Legislature of Puerto Rico around legislation
about the status issue with the goal of resolving the question of political
status.  In that editorial the leadership of the newspaper presents as a
given the existence of a consensus among the pro-independence forces in
favor of a constituent assembly as it is presented and conceived by the
leaders of the Popular Democratic Party and contained in two legislative
proposals which are pending before the Legislature of Puerto Rico.

In writing this editorial the leadership of the newspaper Claridad has
committed an error reminiscent of the arrogance and presumed dominance which
helped to cause the debacle of the now defunct Puerto Rican Socialist Party.
  To obviate and disregard the fact that an important sector of the
independence movement and nearly the entire organized socialist sectors in
Puerto Rico do not support this process, does nothing to strengthen our
struggle and is merely an attempt to marginalize the most militant sector of
our struggle, a sector that has played an important role in the recent major
battles of our people (The Peoples General Strike and the Vieques Struggle)
and does not give the readers of Claridad the opportunity to become aware
that there exist various and diverse positions regarding this matter.
Claridad has every right to assume positions but it should continue and
maintain its policy of promoting the exchange and debate of ideas within the
heart of our movement.

The Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, the Federation of University Students
Pro-Independence, the Boricua Popular Army-Macheteros, the Socialist Front
and all its member organizations (Socialist Movement of Workers, Workshop
for Political Formation, Communist Re-Foundation, the Revolutionary Party of
the Puerto Rican Workers, The Young Revolutionary League, The Union of
Socialist Youth-MST), among others, are opposed to a process which is led by
the intellectual elite and from the centers of colonial power.  The
pro-independence activists who are promoting this process cannot explain the
dramatic way in which a radical change such as this would occur in the
thinking of the great masses in Puerto Rico or in the balance of forces
among the different social classes which exist in our country.  Among all
these social classes there exist different political projects.

We can be sure that the New Progressive Party and the Popular Democratic
Party will continue to propose economic and social political projects for
our country which are in tune with northamerican interests in Puerto Rico
and which favor the political and economic privileges of the dominant social
classes in our society.  These dominant social classes some time ago tied
their fortunes and their future with that of the northamerican imperialist
bourgeoisie.

The pro-independence activists who promote participation in this process do
not have an organized political presence at this juncture which would allow
them to have a voice, even a marginal one, in this process, nor do they
attempt to build one.  There is no doubt that this idea originated in the
elitist discussions in the Puerto Rican Bar Association whose source and
inspiration are the ideas of Eugenio Maria de Hostos and the Constitution of
the Free Associated State of Puerto Rico (ELA) founded in 1952.  This idea
of the Puerto Rican Bar Association has been decreasing in its quality to
the extent that it is filtered through the colonial political apparatus.  In
addition to not having either organizational incidence nor electoral weight
that would allow it to come even remotely close to the strength that both
the colonialist and annexationist forces presently have, they have not
presented to the people of Puerto Rico a project for substantive
decolonization which they think would be the result of their participation
in this project.  The independent organization of the working class in
defense of its political and economic interests is the fundamental
requirement of political strength that we need to be able to impact the
capitalist colonial relationship which has characterized Puerto Rico since
the latter part of the 19th century.

The models of economic development and political organization and the entire
social morass that characterizes our country all respond to powerful
interests in Puerto Rico and the United States and the ideology of
dependence which still prevails with great strength because the attraction
and lure of the economic and political models of the traditional
pro-independence sectors, no longer convince anyone.  Neither the Puerto
Rican bourgeoisie, nor the country�s intellectuals which have been left like
orphans without a political project, will be capable of producing a
political project for future decolonization for our people because within
their conception of the world they will not be able to design one which goes
beyond their own interests that is one other than the model we have today.

In the best-case scenario of the remote possibility of an associated
republic in a not too distant future, such a process would be designed in
harmony with the interests of the political and economic sectors dominating
our country and based on its subordination to imperialism.  This possibility
is a remote one because it does not have a social class with enough strength
to defend it and because the sector which designs it will not have the
capability to convince the masses of workers that it is in their economic,
political and social interests.

We, the socialist of Puerto Rico, have a responsibility to continue the task
of organizing our forces and to deepen and broaden the dissemination of the
ideas of liberation and justice in the hearts of working class people so
that in the future, sooner rather than later, and as a part of the struggles
of all the peoples of the world, we can generate in an independent manner
sufficient strength and the political force which will allow us to liberate
ourselves from the colonial imperialist yoke. This will allow us to build a
better society based on justice and freedom and based on the enjoyment of
the spiritual and material wealth which are now only available to a few.

Los socialistas y la llamada
Asamblea de Pueblo sobre el status

Por Jorge Farinacci


En el editorial del peri�dico Claridad, edici�n del 24 al 31 de julio, la
direcci�n del peri�dico hace suyo el planteamiento de varios sectores del
independentismo apoyando el proceso que se intenta comenzar en la
legislatura de Puerto Rico sobre una legislaci�n de status de pueblo con el
prop�sito de “resolver el dilema del status”. En esta editorial
la direcci�n del peri�dico da por hecho la existencia de un consenso en el
independentismo en favor de un proceso de asamblea constituyente tal y como
lo conciben los dirigentes del Partido Popular y el cual est� plasmado en
dos proyectos de ley pendientes en la legislatura de Puerto Rico.

Al escribir esta editorial la direcci�n del peri�dico Claridad comete un
error que nos recuerda a la arrogancia y prepotencia que ayudaron a causar
la debacle del hoy difunto Partido Socialista Puertorriqueo. El
obviar el hecho de que un sector importante del independentismo y casi la
totalidad del sector socialista organizado en Puerto Rico no favorecen este
proceso no le hace bien a nuestra lucha y es solamente un intento de
marginar al sector m�s militante de nuestra lucha, el cual ha tenido un rol
muy importante en las recientes grandes batallas de nuestro pueblo (Huelga
del Pueblo y Vieques)y no le brinda a los lectores de Claridad la
oportunidad de conocer que existen diversas posiciones frente a este asunto.
Claridad tiene todo el derecho a tomar posiciones pero debe mantener su
pol�tica de fomentar el debate de ideas en el seno de nuestro movimiento.

El Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico, la Federaci�n de Universitarios Pro
Independencia, el Ejercito Popular Boricua-Macheteros, el Frente Socialista
y todas sus organizaciones (Movimiento Socialista de Trabajadores, Taller de
Formaci�n Pol�tica, Refundaci�n Comunista, Partido Revolucionario de los
Trabajadores Puertorriqueos, Liga Juvenil Revolucionaria y Uni�n de
Juventudes Socialistas-MST) ,entre otros, se oponen a un proceso dirigido
desde las �lites intelectuales y desde los centros de poder colonial. Los
independentistas que promueven el mismo no pueden explicar la manera
dram�tica en que ocurrir�  un cambio radical en el pensamiento de las
grandes mayor�as en Puerto Rico y en la correlaci�n de fuerzas entre las
diversas clases sociales existentes en nuestro pa�s, las cuales tienen
proyectos pol�ticos distintos entre s�. Podemos estar seguros de que el
Partido Nuevo Progresista y el Partido Popular Democr�tico seguir�n
proponiendo proyectos pol�ticos sociales y econ�micos para nuestro pa�s
afines con los intereses norteamericanos en Puerto Rico y que  favorezcan
los privilegios pol�ticos y econ�micos de las clases sociales dominantes en
nuestra sociedad, las cuales hace muchos aos amarraron su suerte y
su futuro a la burgues�a imperialista norteamericana.

Los independentistas que promueven la participaci�n en este proceso no
tienen, en este momento,  una correspondencia organizativa ,o el intento de
tenerla, que les permita tener una voz aunque sea marginal en este proceso.
No hay duda de que esta idea se origin� en discusiones   elitistas del
Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico utilizando como fuente de inspiraci�n las
ideas de Eugenio Mar�a de Hostos y la Constituci�n del Estado Libre Asociado
de Puerto Rico del 1952 . Esta idea del Colegio de Abogados ha ido
desmereciendo en calidad a medida que pasa por el crisol de los pol�ticos
coloniales. Adem�s de no tener correspondencia organizativa ni fuerza
electoral que les permita trastocar la fuerza que hoy tienen los sectores
colonialistas y anexionistas, tampoco le han presentado al pueblo el
proyecto descolonizador sustantivo que piensan ser� el resultado de su
participaci�n en este  proyecto. La organizaci�n independiente del pueblo
trabajador en defensa de sus intereses pol�ticos y econ�micos es el
requisito primordial de fuerza que necesitamos para poder trastocar la
relaci�n colonial capitalista que caracteriza a Puerto Rico desde finales
del siglo XIX .Los modelos de desarrollo econ�mico, de organizaci�n pol�tica
y todo el tinglado social que nos caracteriza, responden a intereses
poderosos aqu� en Puerto Rico como en los Estados Unidos y la ideolog�a de
dependencia todav�a prevalece con gran fuerza ya que los amagos de proyectos
y modelos pol�ticos y econ�micos del independentismo tradicional no
convencen a nadie. Ni la burgues�a puertorriquea ni la
intelectualidad criolla, hu�rfana de proyecto pol�tico, ser�n capaces de
producir  un proyecto de futuro descolonizador para nuestro pueblo porque
dentro de su concepci�n de mundo no podr�n dise�ar uno que sea superior para
sus intereses que el modelo que hoy tenemos. En el mejor caso de la remota
posibilidad de una rep�blica asociada en alg�n futuro no muy lejano, �sta
ser� diseada en armon�a con los intereses de los sectores pol�ticos
y econ�micos hegem�nicos en nuestro pa�s partiendo de la subordinaci�n al
imperialismo. Esta posibilidad es remota porque no tiene una clase social
con fuerza para defenderla y porque  el sector que la disee no ser�
capaz de convencer al pueblo trabajador de que la misma responder� a sus
intereses econ�micos, pol�ticos y sociales.

Los socialistas de Puerto Rico tenemos la responsabilidad de seguir la
tarea de organizar nuestras fuerzas y de ampliar y profundizar la
diseminaci�n de las ideas libertadoras y de justicia en el seno del pueblo
trabajador para que en alg�n momento futuro, m�s temprano que tarde, y como
parte de la lucha de todos los pueblos del mundo generemos de manera
independiente la fuerza suficiente que nos permita liberarnos del yugo
colonial imperialista y podamos construir una sociedad superior basada en la
justicia, en la libertad y en el disfrute de los bienes materiales y
espirituales hoy disponibles para s�lo unos pocos.

Jorge Farinacci, es un lider y protavoz de el Frente Socialista De Puerto
Rico.

legislatura de Puerto Rico sobre una legislaci�n de status de pueblo con el
prop�sito de “resolver el dilema del status”. En esta editorial
la direcci�n del peri�dico da por hecho la existencia de un consenso en el
independentismo en favor de un proceso de asamblea constituyente tal y como
lo conciben los dirigentes del Partido Popular y el cual est� plasmado en
dos proyectos de ley pendientes en la legislatura de Puerto Rico.

Al escribir esta editorial la direcci�n del peri�dico Claridad comete un
error que nos recuerda a la arrogancia y prepotencia que ayudaron a causar
la debacle del hoy difunto Partido Socialista Puertorriqueo. El
obviar el hecho de que un sector importante del independentismo y casi la
totalidad del sector socialista organizado en Puerto Rico no favorecen este
proceso no le hace bien a nuestra lucha y es solamente un intento de
marginar al sector m�s militante de nuestra lucha, el cual ha tenido un rol
muy importante en las recientes grandes batallas de nuestro pueblo (Huelga
del Pueblo y Vieques)y no le brinda a los lectores de Claridad la
oportunidad de conocer que existen diversas posiciones frente a este asunto.
Claridad tiene todo el derecho a tomar posiciones pero debe mantener su
pol�tica de fomentar el debate de ideas en el seno de nuestro movimiento.

El Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico, la Federaci�n de Universitarios Pro
Independencia, el Ejercito Popular Boricua-Macheteros, el Frente Socialista
y todas sus organizaciones (Movimiento Socialista de Trabajadores, Taller de
Formaci�n Pol�tica, Refundaci�n Comunista, Partido Revolucionario de los
Trabajadores Puertorriqueos, Liga Juvenil Revolucionaria y Uni�n de
Juventudes Socialistas-MST) ,entre otros, se oponen a un proceso dirigido
desde las �lites intelectuales y desde los centros de poder colonial. Los
independentistas que promueven el mismo no pueden explicar la manera
dram�tica en que ocurrir�  un cambio radical en el pensamiento de las
grandes mayor�as en Puerto Rico y en la correlaci�n de fuerzas entre las
diversas clases sociales existentes en nuestro pa�s, las cuales tienen
proyectos pol�ticos distintos entre s�. Podemos estar seguros de que el
Partido Nuevo Progresista y el Partido Popular Democr�tico seguir�n
proponiendo proyectos pol�ticos sociales y econ�micos para nuestro pa�s
afines con los intereses norteamericanos en Puerto Rico y que  favorezcan
los privilegios pol�ticos y econ�micos de las clases sociales dominantes en
nuestra sociedad, las cuales hace muchos aos amarraron su suerte y
su futuro a la burgues�a imperialista norteamericana.

Los independentistas que promueven la participaci�n en este proceso no
tienen, en este momento,  una correspondencia organizativa ,o el intento de
tenerla, que les permita tener una voz aunque sea marginal en este proceso.
No hay duda de que esta idea se origin� en discusiones   elitistas del
Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico utilizando como fuente de inspiraci�n las
ideas de Eugenio Mar�a de Hostos y la Constituci�n del Estado Libre Asociado
de Puerto Rico del 1952 . Esta idea del Colegio de Abogados ha ido
desmereciendo en calidad a medida que pasa por el crisol de los pol�ticos
coloniales. Adem�s de no tener correspondencia organizativa ni fuerza
electoral que les permita trastocar la fuerza que hoy tienen los sectores
colonialistas y anexionistas, tampoco le han presentado al pueblo el
proyecto descolonizador sustantivo que piensan ser� el resultado de su
participaci�n en este  proyecto. La organizaci�n independiente del pueblo
trabajador en defensa de sus intereses pol�ticos y econ�micos es el
requisito primordial de fuerza que necesitamos para poder trastocar la
relaci�n colonial capitalista que caracteriza a Puerto Rico desde finales
del siglo XIX .Los modelos de desarrollo econ�mico, de organizaci�n pol�tica
y todo el tinglado social que nos caracteriza, responden a intereses
poderosos aqu� en Puerto Rico como en los Estados Unidos y la ideolog�a de
dependencia todav�a prevalece con gran fuerza ya que los amagos de proyectos
y modelos pol�ticos y econ�micos del independentismo tradicional no
convencen a nadie. Ni la burgues�a puertorriquea ni la
intelectualidad criolla, hu�rfana de proyecto pol�tico, ser�n capaces de
producir  un proyecto de futuro descolonizador para nuestro pueblo porque
dentro de su concepci�n de mundo no podr�n dise�ar uno que sea superior para
sus intereses que el modelo que hoy tenemos. En el mejor caso de la remota
posibilidad de una rep�blica asociada en alg�n futuro no muy lejano, �sta
ser� diseada en armon�a con los intereses de los sectores pol�ticos
y econ�micos hegem�nicos en nuestro pa�s partiendo de la subordinaci�n al
imperialismo. Esta posibilidad es remota porque no tiene una clase social
con fuerza para defenderla y porque  el sector que la disee no ser�
capaz de convencer al pueblo trabajador de que la misma responder� a sus
intereses econ�micos, pol�ticos y sociales.

Los socialistas de Puerto Rico tenemos la responsabilidad de seguir la
tarea de organizar nuestras fuerzas y de ampliar y profundizar la
diseminaci�n de las ideas libertadoras y de justicia en el seno del pueblo
trabajador para que en alg�n momento futuro, m�s temprano que tarde, y como
parte de la lucha de todos los pueblos del mundo generemos de manera
independiente la fuerza suficiente que nos permita liberarnos del yugo
colonial imperialista y podamos construir una sociedad superior basada en la
justicia, en la libertad y en el disfrute de los bienes materiales y
espirituales hoy disponibles para s�lo unos pocos.

Jorge Farinacci, es un lider y protavoz de el Frente Socialista De Puerto
Rico.

�UNIDOS SOMOS INVENCIBLES!

Por Ram�n Laba�ino
Uno de los Cinco H�roes Cubanos prisioneros injustamente en EE.UU.


Vivimos tiempos cruciales en el desarrollo de la humanidad. La vida del ser 
humano est� en peligro, el planeta se arriesga a desaparecer, si no 
detenemos a tiempo esta fuerza atroz y descabellada del Imperialismo 
Nazi-Fascista. Pero la forma de derrotarles existe y est� en nuestras manos: 
LA UNIDAD.

En estos momentos es imperioso e imprescindible UNIRNOS, y salvar la raza 
humana, el planeta, para las futuras generaciones. Esta es nuestra deuda con 
la historia y con nuestros propios hijos.

Sabemos que lograr esta UNIDAD no es f�cil, m�s cuando el Imperialismo nos 
teme unidos, y hace todo a su alcance para mantenernos aislados y d�biles, 
desde usar la propaganda enga�osa, hasta crear falsos l�deres e infiltrar 
nuestras filas de traidores y peones del Imperio. Pero es tarea nuestra 
depurar nuestras filas y fortalecernos.
Hay que empezar por UNIR a todas las fuerzas progresistas, de izquierda, 
ecologistas, luchadores civiles, etc, en un frente cohesionado 
Anti-Imperialista; y no hablamos de sue�os ni imposibles, pues las 
condiciones para ello existen, veamos:

Hoy m�s que nunca antes existe un fuerte movimiento popular casi un�nime en 
contra de la Guerra, del Imperialismo Norteamericano y su bloque de 
vasallos; existe una enorme repulsa a la figura del se�or George W. Bush, 
crece la lucha por los derechos civiles tanto en EE.UU. como en el resto de 
las grandes potencias, hay un elevado descontento por el desastre del 
Neo-Liberalismo y por las f�rmulas capitalistas, que han llevado a nuestros 
pa�ses a una profunda e insalvable crisis, que parece sin salida. �Como es 
posible entonces que no podamos aglutinar todas estas fuerzas en un frente 
�nico e indivisible?

Si en los a�os 1960-1970, cuando el gran auge de la lucha por los derechos 
civiles, sal�an a las calles manifestantes en n�mero de 20 000 y 30 000, y 
eran considerados como un movimiento fuerte y pujante; �c�mo es posible que 
hoy salgan a las calles en cifras sin precedentes de 200 000, 250 000, 1 000 
000, y hasta 2 000 000 de personas (como ha ocurrido en ciudades de Francia 
e Inglaterra, recientemente), y no seamos capaces de capitalizar, organizar 
y dirigir estas fabulosas fuerzas en aras del bien com�n: salvar el planeta, 
derrotando al imperialismo?
Para lograr la UNIDAD, debemos dejar a un lado mezquinos intereses 
personales y econ�micos, y pensar en el sacrificio y el esfuerzo como mejor 
recompensa por el bien de la humanidad.

Debemos buscar los l�deres de cada movimiento y en cada pa�s, y que cuenten 
con el apoyo mayoritario o un�nime de todos, que tenga la humildad, carisma 
y poder pol�tico de convencer y unir fuerzas.

El peor enemigo que puede haber en el movimiento progresista es aquel que 
nos divide o corrompe, y a ese m�s que nadie, hay que combatir y excomulgar 
de nuestras filas. Debemos ser celosos guardianes de la cohesi�n, la unidad 
y la pureza de nuestras fuerzas, y nunca perder la idea central: La lucha 
contra el Imperialismo.

Una vez que logremos esa Unidad monol�tica y organizada, se pasar�a entonces 
a la actividad progresista coordinada y s�lida, para dar respuesta a cada 
mal que se imponga.

Cada pueblo encontrar� cu�l es la v�a adecuada a sus condiciones objetivas y 
subjetivas, habr� que ser creativos y audaces, y no copiar f�rmulas 
prefijadas que no respondan a nuestras realidades.

Habr� que combatir en todos los frentes; por ejemplo, habr�a que crear una 
especie de CONTRA-MEDIA; o sea una poderosa empresa informativa, que con la 
verdad real, objetiva y amena, sea capaz de enfrentar y derrotar la nociva, 
tergiversadora y mentirosa propaganda imperial. Para ello habr�a que reunir 
recursos venidos de personalidades y organizaciones progresistas que cuenten 
con ellos, y as�, ir creando la MEDIA PROGRESISTA. Por ahora todos los 
esfuerzos que hagamos en la Internet son muy importantes; pero hay que hacer 
m�s, de forma que lleguemos a cada persona del planeta.

Por otro lado, el papel que han de jugar nuestros intelectuales progresistas 
es de gran importancia, siempre teniendo en cuenta que se puede criticar al 
amigo; pero nunca usar propaganda hostil y devastadora, que destruya la 
UNIDAD, y sirva como instrumento de ataque en manos del enemigo. Esto es 
casi una traici�n al movimiento progresista, y no se debe tolerar.

Ser�a iluso pensar que, un hombre "progresista", por miedo o con cuidado de 
salvar su vida ante la atrocidad imperial, trate de congraciarse con el 
imperio, criticando a las fuerzas de izquierda o progresistas del mundo; 
ser�a esto bien iluso pues, no tenga la menor duda de que, m�s tarde o m�s 
temprano, el imperialismo tratar� de exterminarnos, uno a uno; por la simple 
raz�n de que nosotros somos sus enemigos naturales; y aun con m�s desprecio 
lo har�a con aquellos que, a �ltima hora se convirtieron en traidores de la 
humanidad.

Este es, en fin, un llamado a la UNIDAD de todas nuestras fuerzas; porque 
estamos convencidos que no hay gobierno del mundo por poderoso que sea, que 
no caiga ante el empuje de todo su pueblo volcado contra �l.

Por eso, tenemos que UNIRNOS, ORGANIZAR Y DIRIGIR a nuestros pueblos como 
�nica forma de salvarlos del desastre al cual el Capitalismo, en su fase 
�ltima y terminal, nos arrastra con todas sus guerras, crisis y conflictos.

After the Vieques Victory How Does Puerto Rico
Fit Into US Strategies for Global Domination?

Saturday, September 20
The Brecht Forum
122 West 27th Street - 10th Floor
Between 6th and 7th Avenue, Manhattan, New York City
10:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.
1-Day Seminar

Sponsored by the Vieques Support Campaign &amp; the Brecht Forum.

Jorge Farinacci, Ismael Guadalupe &amp; Others To Be Announced.

Why would the U.S. close down a base when its war machine is revved up
at an all time high?

On May 1, 2003, after years of worldwide protest, the U.S. Navy halted
the bombing of Vieques-at least for now. But the U.S. has neither
relinquished it to the people of Vieques or addressed the urgently
needed decontamination of the island after 63 years of constant naval
target practice.

The fact is that Vieques is only the tip of the military "iceberg" in
Puerto Rico. The pentagon controls 14% of the entire Puerto Rican
territory. There are 109 U.S. military bases and facilities in Puerto
Rico of which Fort Buchanan and Roosevelt Roads are the largest.
Puerto Rico houses 80% of the U.S. Southern Command, which includes
the invasion forces for all of Latin America, and all troops on their
way to Africa pass through Puerto Rico. The island is also home to the
elite components of the U.S. military such as the Green Berets, Navy
Seals, Air Force Commandos, etc.

In short, Puerto Rico is central to U.S. military domination of Latin
America and plays a major role in the global strategies of the U.S.

This one-day seminar will address the informational needs of activists
in solidarity work with the national liberation struggle as well as
activists in the Puerto Rican community and anti-war movement.

Report from the Peace and Justice Camp
24 August, 203

The Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques is committed to the 
common saying here:  the struggle continues!  Every day the CRDV office in 
the Peace and Justice Camp receives and sends messages related to the work 
in this new phase in the struggle for peace on Vieques.  Our commissions on 
environment, health and development keep an intense work pace.  Myrna Pagan 
directs the Health Commission and together with Aleja Ortiz, Fela Garc�a and 
Dr. Rafael Rivera Casta�o, participate in community meetings and workshops 
with the PR Health Department to demand the medical services our people 
deserve.  Nilda Medina, Ismael Guadalupe and Gregorio Feliciano make up the 
CRDV Environment Commission and coordinate efforts to form a technical 
advisory team for the community to help design the urgently needed 
strategies to deal with the highly complicated issues of decontamination.  
Recently, in Puerto Rico, a second meeting of this initiative was held with 
the participation of the Environmental Law Clinic at the UPR; environmental 
scientists, Dr. Arturo Massol and nucelar engineer Frankie Jim�nez.  Also in 
attendance were members of the CRDV and Viequenses, Pedro Oliveras, Nandy 
Camacho and Rosita L�pez.

The CRDV Development Commission, made up of Armando Torres, Cynthia 
Mart�nez, Letty P�rez, Edgardo Rodr�guez, Carmen Valencia, Fabi�n Mart�nez, 
Robert Rabin and Xaymara Romero, prepares for the second organizing meeting 
of the Community Coalition for Sustainable Development on Vieques.  (See 
Coalition press release).  This initiative is every day more urgent due to 
the threat from speculators who look to control the greatest possible amount 
of our lands, displacing our people at an alarming rate.  The efforts of the 
Community Coalition are indispensible to assure that a Vieques freed from 
the Navy will really be controlled by the people of Vieques.

Javier Rosario, from the UPR Law School, in coordination with the CRDV, the 
Vieques Women's Alliance and the Community Group for Vieques Decontamination 
(part of the Technical Review Committee that works on clean up issues on the 
Western end of Vieques), works on funding for community education and 
technical support.  Members of the CRDV met recently with Mary Skelton, of 
the Consensus Building Institute of Boston, to discuss a proposal to help 
set up community coalitions for environmental as well as sustainable 
development initiatives.

While we work on these projects, the CRDV plays a key role in the support 
campaign for those accused in relation to the May First incidents.  Nilda 
Medina, founding member of the CRDV is one of the accused who face sentences 
of up to 20 years for charges of damage to federal property and conspiracy.  
Alba Avill�n and Xiomari Tirado, wives of two of the accused and 
coordinators of the Committee of Family and Friends of the May First 
Accused, have worked tirelessly to come up with the funding necesarry to 
cover the costs of transportation and others related to the case.  At a 
press conference in San Juan last Thursday, Myrta Sanes (mother of Jose 
Monta�ez Sanes, another accused, and sister to David Sanes); Alba Avill�n 
(wife of accused, Willi Mir�); Xiomari Tirado (wife of accused, Manuel 
P�rez) and Yolanda Medina (sister of Nilda Medina) made excellent 
declarations about the injustice of these accusations against people highly 
regarded in the community and far from being criminals, are victims of the 
criminal activity b the US Navy in Vieques.

In the name of the accused and their families, we thank the Pro Vieques 
Camp, located in the area of the federal prison at Guaynabo, who have 
coordinated logistic support - transportation, food, and housing - for the 
Viequenses during the trial period that could begin early September.  We 
extend this note of gratitude to the members of the Committee in Support of 
the Vieques Twelve and the brigade of lawyers for the defense who volunteer 
their vital services.  These are manifestations of the Puerto Rican 
solidarity that is a key element of the magic that explains the success of 
our people against the most powerful military force in the history of 
humanity.

We send a loving embrace of Congratulations to Flavio Cumpiano, Esq. CRDV 
representative in Washington, DC and Stephanie Saenger, on the occasion of 
their recent marriage.  Flavio has provided consistent and crucial 
information and advice for our committee during the past four years of 
intense struggle.

We also send our prayers and positive energies to Norma Torres and Jenny 
Ben�tez, part of our CRDV,  undergoing cancer treatment.  On the night of 22 
August, over thirty people participated in a prayer circle at the Milivy 
Camp, with the presence of Norma and under the direction of the Deacon of 
the local Catholic Church - and civil disobedient - Justino L�pez, Jr.

PRESS RELEASE
20 AUGUST, 2003

VIEQUENSES SUPPORT ACCUSED FOR MAY FIRST ACTIONS

Convinced that those accused for the May First events are not criminals, the 
Mayor of Vieques, D�maso Serrano L�pez and the Municipal Assembly 
unanimously approved Resolution Number 5-2003, dated 18 August in support of 
the accused and for a motion to dismiss all charges.  The resolution states 
that �� the destructive acts were provoked by decades of repressed rage and 
frustration and not mallice or criminal intent��  The PNP (statehood party) 
representative on the assembly supported the accused as did an outspoken pro 
Navy member of the PPD (government party) on the assembly.  After the voting 
session, she said to the accused and family members present:  �You all know 
my position on the military; however, in this case I have to support my 
people because I know you are not criminals, but good Viequenses.�

The resolution was presented at a press conference in San Juan with the

After the Vieques Victory How Does Puerto Rico
Fit Into US Strategies for Global Domination?

Saturday, September 20
The Brecht Forum
122 West 27th Street - 10th Floor
Between 6th and 7th Avenue, Manhattan, New York City
10:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.
1-Day Seminar

Sponsored by the Vieques Support Campaign &amp; the Brecht Forum.

Jorge Farinacci, Ismael Guadalupe &amp; Others To Be Announced.

Why would the U.S. close down a base when its war machine is revved up
at an all time high?

On May 1, 2003, after years of worldwide protest, the U.S. Navy halted
the bombing of Vieques-at least for now. But the U.S. has neither
relinquished it to the people of Vieques or addressed the urgently
needed decontamination of the island after 63 years of constant naval
target practice.

The fact is that Vieques is only the tip of the military "iceberg" in
Puerto Rico. The pentagon controls 14% of the entire Puerto Rican
territory. There are 109 U.S. military bases and facilities in Puerto
Rico of which Fort Buchanan and Roosevelt Roads are the largest.
Puerto Rico houses 80% of the U.S. Southern Command, which includes
the invasion forces for all of Latin America, and all troops on their
way to Africa pass through Puerto Rico. The island is also home to the
elite components of the U.S. military such as the Green Berets, Navy
Seals, Air Force Commandos, etc.

In short, Puerto Rico is central to U.S. military domination of Latin
America and plays a major role in the global strategies of the U.S.

This one-day seminar will address the informational needs of activists
in solidarity work with the national liberation struggle as well as
activists in the Puerto Rican community and anti-war movement.

Report from the Peace and Justice Camp
24 August, 203

The Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques is committed to the 
common saying here:  the struggle continues!  Every day the CRDV office in 
the Peace and Justice Camp receives and sends messages related to the work 
in this new phase in the struggle for peace on Vieques.  Our commissions on 
environment, health and development keep an intense work pace.  Myrna Pagan 
directs the Health Commission and together with Aleja Ortiz, Fela Garc�a and 
Dr. Rafael Rivera Casta�o, participate in community meetings and workshops 
with the PR Health Department to demand the medical services our people 
deserve.  Nilda Medina, Ismael Guadalupe and Gregorio Feliciano make up the 
CRDV Environment Commission and coordinate efforts to form a technical 
advisory team for the community to help design the urgently needed 
strategies to deal with the highly complicated issues of decontamination.  
Recently, in Puerto Rico, a second meeting of this initiative was held with 
the participation of the Environmental Law Clinic at the UPR; environmental 
scientists, Dr. Arturo Massol and nucelar engineer Frankie Jim�nez.  Also in 
attendance were members of the CRDV and Viequenses, Pedro Oliveras, Nandy 
Camacho and Rosita L�pez.

The CRDV Development Commission, made up of Armando Torres, Cynthia 
Mart�nez, Letty P�rez, Edgardo Rodr�guez, Carmen Valencia, Fabi�n Mart�nez, 
Robert Rabin and Xaymara Romero, prepares for the second organizing meeting 
of the Community Coalition for Sustainable Development on Vieques.  (See 
Coalition press release).  This initiative is every day more urgent due to 
the threat from speculators who look to control the greatest possible amount 
of our lands, displacing our people at an alarming rate.  The efforts of the 
Community Coalition are indispensible to assure that a Vieques freed from 
the Navy will really be controlled by the people of Vieques.

Javier Rosario, from the UPR Law School, in coordination with the CRDV, the 
Vieques Women's Alliance and the Community Group for Vieques Decontamination 
(part of the Technical Review Committee that works on clean up issues on the 
Western end of Vieques), works on funding for community education and 
technical support.  Members of the CRDV met recently with Mary Skelton, of 
the Consensus Building Institute of Boston, to discuss a proposal to help 
set up community coalitions for environmental as well as sustainable 
development initiatives.

While we work on these projects, the CRDV plays a key role in the support 
campaign for those accused in relation to the May First incidents.  Nilda 
Medina, founding member of the CRDV is one of the accused who face sentences 
of up to 20 years for charges of damage to federal property and conspiracy.  
Alba Avill�n and Xiomari Tirado, wives of two of the accused and 
coordinators of the Committee of Family and Friends of the May First 
Accused, have worked tirelessly to come up with the funding necesarry to 
cover the costs of transportation and others related to the case.  At a 
press conference in San Juan last Thursday, Myrta Sanes (mother of Jose 
Monta�ez Sanes, another accused, and sister to David Sanes); Alba Avill�n 
(wife of accused, Willi Mir�); Xiomari Tirado (wife of accused, Manuel 
P�rez) and Yolanda Medina (sister of Nilda Medina) made excellent 
declarations about the injustice of these accusations against people highly 
regarded in the community and far from being criminals, are victims of the 
criminal activity b the US Navy in Vieques.

In the name of the accused and their families, we thank the Pro Vieques 
Camp, located in the area of the federal prison at Guaynabo, who have 
coordinated logistic support - transportation, food, and housing - for the 
Viequenses during the trial period that could begin early September.  We 
extend this note of gratitude to the members of the Committee in Support of 
the Vieques Twelve and the brigade of lawyers for the defense who volunteer 
their vital services.  These are manifestations of the Puerto Rican 
solidarity that is a key element of the magic that explains the success of 
our people against the most powerful military force in the history of 
humanity.

We send a loving embrace of Congratulations to Flavio Cumpiano, Esq. CRDV 
representative in Washington, DC and Stephanie Saenger, on the occasion of 
their recent marriage.  Flavio has provided consistent and crucial 
information and advice for our committee during the past four years of 
intense struggle.

We also send our prayers and positive energies to Norma Torres and Jenny 
Ben�tez, part of our CRDV,  undergoing cancer treatment.  On the night of 22 
August, over thirty people participated in a prayer circle at the Milivy 
Camp, with the presence of Norma and under the direction of the Deacon of 
the local Catholic Church - and civil disobedient - Justino L�pez, Jr.

frustration and not mallice or criminal intent��  The PNP (statehood party)

session, she said to the accused and family members present:  �You all know 
my position on the military; however, in this case I have to support my 
people because I know you are not criminals, but good Viequenses.�

participation of the Mayor of Vieques, civiL and religious leaders, friends 
and family of the accused.  The Committee of Family and Friends of the

by The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign mourns the loss our sister, ally, comrade 
and friend Safiya Asia Bukhari.  Safiya was an extraordinary human being 
whose life was an example of true dedication and love for all peoples.  
Safiya exemplified the most beautiful and powerful qualities of a 
revolutionary; she was strong, loving, a teacher, a sister to all, 
inspirational, and motivational.  Safiya's commitment to freedom and 
revolution was infectious and touched all who knew her and had the privilege 
to work with her. A powerful force for change and struggle, Safiya was a 
former Black Panther and Black Liberation Army member.  She spent nine years 
as a Political Prisoner for her work with the BLA.  She was the co-chair of 
the New York Free Mumia Coalition and co-coordinated the work of the Jericho 
Movement to Free all Political Priosners and Prisoners of War.  Safiya was 
also a producer for "Where we live" on WBAI 99.5 fm, where she produced 
shows about working class politics and issues.  Safiya, much like Political 
Prisoner Mumia Abu Jamal, was a voice for the voiceless and empowered 
communities through her work.

A consummate internationalist, Safiya's work in solidarity of all National 
Liberation struggles made her a friend and ally to the Puerto Rican 
Independence movement.  Her comiment to the freedom of the Puerto Rican 
Political Prisoners/POWs, endeared  her  to many Puerto Rican Independence 
leaders, such as Rafael Cancel Miranda and Lolita Lebron. Safiya cared for 
the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners/POWs as though they were her own 
family.

The loss of Safiya Bukhari will be felt in the hearts and souls of the 
people for a long time. Safiya gave us strength, hope and determination.  
She taught us about camaraderie and love.  Safiya dedicated her life to 
freedom and revolution; In honor of her amazing example, we continue on the 
road towards freedom for all Political Prisoners and Prisoners of War.  We 
continue moving forward, learning and growing, teaching and passing down our 
revolutionary traditions.  We carry on, with Safiya in our hearts, towards 
liberation as she would have wanted us to.

To my dear friends,

This September 11, 2003 commemorates not only the
attack on the Twin Towers in 2001, but also another
bloody and "terrorist" event in history, and one that
also impacted me personally.

This September 11th, 2003 commemorates 30 years since
the military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet took
over in a bloody coup in Chile. This September 11th
commemorates the death of Salvador Allende, elected by
the people, and left with no option but to commit
suicide while defending the National Palace.

This September 11th commemorates the three years my
father spent in prison and torture during the first
years of the dictatorship. This September 11th
commemorates the several years of imprisonment and
torture of my aunt and uncle, Nieves Ayress and Victor
Toro. This September 11th commemorates our familes
political exile and the wounds that still heal.

This September 11th commemorates the thousands of
Chileans, who died at the hands of torture, and in
prison camps, and the "disappeared" companeros whose
bodies are still being found today. This September
11th commemorates a Chile that continues with a
constitution set up by the military and a "socialist"
government that governs with murderers, forgives the
past, and opens Chile to the "world market."
This September 11th commemorates a CIA and US
government that were directly involved in the military
coup and destabilization of the Allende government.

This September 11th we commemorate the human rights
groups, the FUNA's (denouncement of torturers), the
youth groups, the labor groups, the indigenous
Mapuches that continue resisting.
This September 11th we commemorate the struggle that
still continues....

I would like to invite you to several events for the
30th Anniversary of the death of Salvador Allende and
the 30 years of struggle.

Sincerely,

Marcelo Venegas-Pizarro, MD

After the Vieques Victory How Does Puerto Rico
Fit Into US Strategies for Global Domination?

Saturday, September 20
The Brecht Forum
122 West 27th Street - 10th Floor
Between 6th and 7th Avenue, Manhattan, New York City
10:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.
1-Day Seminar

Sponsored by the Vieques Support Campaign &amp; the Brecht Forum.

Jorge Farinacci, Ismael Guadalupe &amp; Others To Be Announced.

Why would the U.S. close down a base when its war machine is revved up
at an all time high?

On May 1, 2003, after years of worldwide protest, the U.S. Navy halted
the bombing of Vieques-at least for now. But the U.S. has neither
relinquished it to the people of Vieques or addressed the urgently
needed decontamination of the island after 63 years of constant naval
target practice.

The fact is that Vieques is only the tip of the military "iceberg" in
Puerto Rico. The pentagon controls 14% of the entire Puerto Rican
territory. There are 109 U.S. military bases and facilities in Puerto
Rico of which Fort Buchanan and Roosevelt Roads are the largest.
Puerto Rico houses 80% of the U.S. Southern Command, which includes
the invasion forces for all of Latin America, and all troops on their
way to Africa pass through Puerto Rico. The island is also home to the
elite components of the U.S. military such as the Green Berets, Navy
Seals, Air Force Commandos, etc.

In short, Puerto Rico is central to U.S. military domination of Latin
America and plays a major role in the global strategies of the U.S.

This one-day seminar will address the informational needs of activists
in solidarity work with the national liberation struggle as well as
activists in the Puerto Rican community and anti-war movement.

After the Vieques Victory How Does Puerto Rico
Fit Into US Strategies for Global Domination?

Saturday, September 20
The Brecht Forum
122 West 27th Street - 10th Floor
Between 6th and 7th Avenue, Manhattan, New York City
10:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.
1-Day Seminar

Sponsored by the Vieques Support Campaign &amp; the Brecht Forum.

Jorge Farinacci, Ismael Guadalupe &amp; Others To Be Announced.

Why would the U.S. close down a base when its war machine is revved up
at an all time high?

On May 1, 2003, after years of worldwide protest, the U.S. Navy halted
the bombing of Vieques-at least for now. But the U.S. has neither
relinquished it to the people of Vieques or addressed the urgently
needed decontamination of the island after 63 years of constant naval
target practice.

The fact is that Vieques is only the tip of the military "iceberg" in
Puerto Rico. The pentagon controls 14% of the entire Puerto Rican
territory. There are 109 U.S. military bases and facilities in Puerto
Rico of which Fort Buchanan and Roosevelt Roads are the largest.
Puerto Rico houses 80% of the U.S. Southern Command, which includes
the invasion forces for all of Latin America, and all troops on their
way to Africa pass through Puerto Rico. The island is also home to the
elite components of the U.S. military such as the Green Berets, Navy
Seals, Air Force Commandos, etc.

In short, Puerto Rico is central to U.S. military domination of Latin
America and plays a major role in the global strategies of the U.S.

This one-day seminar will address the informational needs of activists
in solidarity work with the national liberation struggle as well as
activists in the Puerto Rican community and anti-war movement.

To my dear friends,

This September 11, 2003 commemorates not only the
attack on the Twin Towers in 2001, but also another
bloody and "terrorist" event in history, and one that
also impacted me personally.

This September 11th, 2003 commemorates 30 years since
the military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet took
over in a bloody coup in Chile. This September 11th
commemorates the death of Salvador Allende, elected by
the people, and left with no option but to commit
suicide while defending the National Palace.

This September 11th commemorates the three years my
father spent in prison and torture during the first
years of the dictatorship. This September 11th
commemorates the several years of imprisonment and
torture of my aunt and uncle, Nieves Ayress and Victor
Toro. This September 11th commemorates our familes
political exile and the wounds that still heal.

This September 11th commemorates the thousands of
Chileans, who died at the hands of torture, and in
prison camps, and the "disappeared" companeros whose
bodies are still being found today. This September
11th commemorates a Chile that continues with a
constitution set up by the military and a "socialist"
government that governs with murderers, forgives the
past, and opens Chile to the "world market."
This September 11th commemorates a CIA and US
government that were directly involved in the military
coup and destabilization of the Allende government.

This September 11th we commemorate the human rights
groups, the FUNA's (denouncement of torturers), the
youth groups, the labor groups, the indigenous
Mapuches that continue resisting.
This September 11th we commemorate the struggle that
still continues....

I would like to invite you to several events for the
30th Anniversary of the death of Salvador Allende and
the 30 years of struggle.

Sincerely,

Marcelo Venegas-Pizarro, MD

After the Vieques Victory How Does Puerto Rico
Fit Into US Strategies for Global Domination?

Saturday, September 20
The Brecht Forum
122 West 27th Street - 10th Floor
Between 6th and 7th Avenue, Manhattan, New York City
10:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.
1-Day Seminar

Sponsored by the Vieques Support Campaign &amp; the Brecht Forum.

Jorge Farinacci, Ismael Guadalupe &amp; Others To Be Announced.

Why would the U.S. close down a base when its war machine is revved up
at an all time high?

On May 1, 2003, after years of worldwide protest, the U.S. Navy halted
the bombing of Vieques-at least for now. But the U.S. has neither
relinquished it to the people of Vieques or addressed the urgently
needed decontamination of the island after 63 years of constant naval
target practice.

The fact is that Vieques is only the tip of the military "iceberg" in
Puerto Rico. The pentagon controls 14% of the entire Puerto Rican
territory. There are 109 U.S. military bases and facilities in Puerto
Rico of which Fort Buchanan and Roosevelt Roads are the largest.
Puerto Rico houses 80% of the U.S. Southern Command, which includes
the invasion forces for all of Latin America, and all troops on their
way to Africa pass through Puerto Rico. The island is also home to the
elite components of the U.S. military such as the Green Berets, Navy
Seals, Air Force Commandos, etc.

In short, Puerto Rico is central to U.S. military domination of Latin
America and plays a major role in the global strategies of the U.S.

This one-day seminar will address the informational needs of activists
in solidarity work with the national liberation struggle as well as
activists in the Puerto Rican community and anti-war movement.

To my dear friends,

This September 11, 2003 commemorates not only the
attack on the Twin Towers in 2001, but also another
bloody and "terrorist" event in history, and one that
also impacted me personally.

This September 11th, 2003 commemorates 30 years since
the military dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet took
over in a bloody coup in Chile. This September 11th
commemorates the death of Salvador Allende, elected by
the people, and left with no option but to commit
suicide while defending the National Palace.

This September 11th commemorates the three years my
father spent in prison and torture during the first
years of the dictatorship. This September 11th
commemorates the several years of imprisonment and
torture of my aunt and uncle, Nieves Ayress and Victor
Toro. This September 11th commemorates our familes
political exile and the wounds that still heal.

This September 11th commemorates the thousands of
Chileans, who died at the hands of torture, and in
prison camps, and the "disappeared" companeros whose
bodies are still being found today. This September
11th commemorates a Chile that continues with a
constitution set up by the military and a "socialist"
government that governs with murderers, forgives the
past, and opens Chile to the "world market."
This September 11th commemorates a CIA and US
government that were directly involved in the military
coup and destabilization of the Allende government.

This September 11th we commemorate the human rights
groups, the FUNA's (denouncement of torturers), the
youth groups, the labor groups, the indigenous
Mapuches that continue resisting.
This September 11th we commemorate the struggle that
still continues....

I would like to invite you to several events for the
30th Anniversary of the death of Salvador Allende and
the 30 years of struggle.

Sincerely,

Marcelo Venegas-Pizarro, MD

Special Report from the Vieques Peace and Justice Camp

CURRENT SITUATION OF ARRESTED FOR MAY FIRST ACTIONS ON VIEQUES

Warm greetings from Vieques.  The ten Viequenses arrested by the FBI in June 
and accused of conspiracy and damage to federal property in relation to 
events here last May first, following suggestions of their lawyers, entered 
into agreements with federal attorneys to avoid application of mandatory 5 
to 20 year sentences against several of the accused.  Ex president of the 
Puerto Rico Federation of Teachers, Jes�s Delgado also followed this 
recommendation.  The trial against Jose P�rez, laborer from Ponce and the 
only one of the twelve accused who decided to go to trial, began Monday, 
September 8th and should finish this same week.  We urge all those in 
solidarity with the Vieques cause to support Jos� and all the accused for 
the May First events.

On 5 September, Jos� V�lez Acosta turned himself in at the Federal Court.  
V�lez is on the FBI list of those of accused but in June when the other 
eleven were arrested  he was in the neighboring island of St. Croix, where 
part of his family lives.  He is being detained at the federal prison at 
Guaynabo pending conversations between his lawyer and federal attorneys.  
Letters can be sent to Jos� at:  MDC Guaynabo, PO Box 2147  SJ, PR  
00922-2147.  His prisoner number - that must be written after his name on 
the envelope - is 23883-069.

On 4 December, Judge Fust� will dictate sentences of the Viequenses.  
Information available on the expected sentences is as follows:  Jorge Cruz 
(21 mos. prison), Jos� Monta�ez Sanes (24 mos. prison), Heriberto Hern�ndez 
(4 mos. prison), Jes�s Delgado (6 mos. house arrest and 1 yr. probation), 
Nilda Medina (1 yr. probation), N�stor de Jes�s (6 mos. house arrest, 2 yrs. 
probation), Osvald Skerret (2 yrs. probation, 6 mos. house arrest), William 
Mir� (1 yr. probation), Manuel P�rez (1 yr. probation), Andy Santiago (1yr. 
probation).

The Viequenses accused and their families express their gratitude for the 
work and sacrifice by lawyers:  Linda Backiel, Mar�a Sandoval; Judith 
Berkan, Peter Berkowitz; Luis Guzm�n; Enrique Juli�; Jorge Luis Armenteros; 
Juan Matos Bonet; Juan Matos de Juan, Pedro Varela, Edgar Vega Pab�n, Ferm�n 
Arraiza.

Attorney Taina Moscoso, of the Puerto Rico Bar Association's Special 
Commision on Vieques, together with lawyer Jos�e Pantojas of the Committee 
in Support of the Vieques Accused for May First, have made great efforts to 
coordinate meetings and movement of information between lawyers, accused and 
families.  On Saturday, 6 September, the CSVAMay 1st held a successful radio 
marathon in which 20 thousand dollars was raised to help with legal and 
other costs for accused and family members.  Those interested in helping can 
send donations to:

Committee in Support of the Vieques Accused for May First
PO Box 191792        San Juan, Puerto Rico  00919-1792

Donations can also be deposited directily the Banco Popular account

Press Release

Viequenses in solidarity with Jos� P�rez, accused for May First acts in 
Vieques

The Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques (CRDV) expressed 
solidarity with Jos� P�rez, worker from Ponce accused for events on May 
First in Vieques, whose trial began yesterday in the Federal Court.  �We are 
in solidarity with Jos� and all those accused for May First actions because 
they are not criminals,� said leaders of the Vieques group.  The charges 
against Jos� carry sentences of five to twenty years in jail.  Members of 
the CRDV said the sentences are disproportionate to the events of that 
night.

Jos� P�rez exemplifies the thousands of Puerto Rican men and women who made 
great sacrifices in favor of the people of Vieques and �... now its our turn 
to show solidarity with him�, said members of the CRDV.

According to spokespersons for the community group, the actions of May First 
� the destruction of a guard kiosk and the burning of vehicles � were not 
motivated by mallice or criminal intent but by the strong emotions of that 
historic moment that marked the end of sixty years of bombing and abuses by 
the Navy in Vieques.

Jos� P�rez was arrested on two occasions during the past four years for 
civil disobedience in support of peace on Vieques.  We urge all those in 
solidarity with the Vieques cause to show support for Jos�.

ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON TURNS 58 YEARS YOUNG ON SATURDAY OCTOBER 4TH, 2003!!

Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Antonio Camacho Negron was moved to a US 
Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.

Antonio Camacho Negron was forced onto parole on May 2002.  He refused to 
acknowledge any parole conditions, stating that any adherence to parole 
conditions would be accepting the United States hegemony over Puerto Rico.  
Antonio  spent  over a year touring Puerto Rico, speaking at Public 
activities and demonstrations despite his parole conditions excluding him 
from such activities.

Antonio was re-arrested on April 14th, 2003 for parole violations and was 
taken to MDC Guaynabo a Federal Prison in Puerto Rico.   Antonio� s case was 
rejected by a local Puerto Rican judge, stating that his case was out of the 
judge�s jurisdiction.  Antonio remained in MDC Guaynabo until he was moved 
to Philadelphia on Tuesday August 11th, 2003, awaiting a new hearting for 
his parole violation.  He is now currently in Lewisburg and is not clear 
whether the hearing has taken place or not.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign will keep all our allies and supporters 
abreast of any updates in Antonio�s situation.  We will publish information 
as it comes to us.
The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is asking all our supporters and allies to 
write to Antonio and send him commissary donations.

Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques
Update on Accused for May First Actions

Friends in Solidarity with the Struggle for Peace on Vieques:

Warm greetings from Vieques. Jos� P�rez Gonzalez (#21519-069) and Jos� V�lez 
Acosta (#23883-069) are in the Federal Prison in Puerto Rico in relation to 
actions on Vieques last May first. You can write them at:
(Name and prisoner number) MDC Guaynabo P.O. Box 2147 SJ, PR 00922-2147

For a list of articles prisoners may recieve or other information about them 
call 787 749-4480

December 4 is the date set for sentencing for the twelve accused for May 
first actions. Jorge Cruz, Jos� Monta�ez Sanes and Eric Hern�ndez face 
sentences of 21, 24 and 4 months respectively. It is expected that Jos� 
P�rez and Jos� V�lez receive higher sentences. The rest of the accused - 
Jes�s Delgado, Willie Mir�, Manuel P�rez, N�stor de Jes�s, Nilda Medina, 
Andy Santiago y Osvaldo Skerret - expect to be given probation. However, at 
the moment of sentencing the judge could impose higher penalties than those 
stipulated.

We urge all people in solidarity with the Vieques cause to write these 
'compa�eros' imprisoned and to be attentive to information on the Twelve of 
Vieques.

It is very important that people write to the Vieques Political Prisoners 
and send them commissary donations:

For a world free of U.S. military occupation &amp; colonialism, from Puerto Rico 
to Iraq, ALL OUT TO DC OCTOBER 25!

Join ProLibertad Freedom Campaign, Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico
New York Committee, the Vieques Support Campaign and many others, in a
Vieques/Puerto Rico contingent at an anti-war protest in Washington,
DC on October 25th. The protest is sponsored by International
A.N.S.W.E.R. and United For Peace &amp; Justice.

The same U.S. government responsible for the brutal occupation of the
Iraqi peoples' homeland, is also waging a campaign of reprisals
against the people of Vieques. There are 12 political defendents in
Puerto Rico facing serious charges for simply exercising their right
to celebrate with defiance, the closing of the U.S. Navy target
practice range in Vieques on May 1 of this year.

The Committee for the Rescue &amp; Development of Vieques has called on
its supporters everywhere to protest the continued abuse of the
people of that Puerto Rican island. The abuses continue and therefore,
the struggle will continue.

The cancer and other consequences of the six decades of bombing
practices are taking its toll in the lives of the people there; U.S.
officials refuse to address the issue of decontamination and the
return of the stolen lands to the people.

The misery and destruction which Vieques continues to suffer are for
reasons none other than the lust U.S. officials have for war. Since
1941, U.S. military operations have been rehearst on the island of
Vieques, Puerto Rico.

The Puerto Rican experience confirms precisely what are U.S. motives
in Iraq - colonial domination. All out to Washington, DC on October 25
to oppose U.S. military occupation from Puerto Rico to Iraq. Join the
Vieques/Puerto Rico Contingent.

Bus Tickets for Vieques/Boricua contingent are now available.

* Price: $30
* Time: 6:30 A.M.
* Buses for the Vieques/Boricua contingent will leave from 33rd &amp; 34th
  Streets on 8th Avenue, New York City.

For more information regarding the Vieques/Boricua contingent, please
call: (718)601-4751 (212)677-0619 (212)749-8024

PRESS RELEASE
October 16, 2003

The health and well being of Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar L�pez 
Rivera is at this moment at risk. Last March, Dr. Taude, a surgeon at USP 
Terre Haute, diagnosed bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would 
recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that the hernias be surgically repaired. 
Since that time Mr. L�pez has reported to medical staff that he has 
increasing pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still 
able to exercise vigorously, but he currently unable to do so because of the 
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since diagnosis, Mr. 
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez 
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the 
Bureau of Prisons to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We have consulted with physicians who inform us that although the hernias 
seem to be reducible, with the increasing pain, one of the two hernias might 
become stuck, which could result in a surgical emergency.

Oscar, serving a 70 year sentence, is not eligible for release until 2027. 
For more than half of his 22 years in prison, he was held in the most 
maximum security prisons in the United States in the strictest solitary 
confinement, politically punitive conditions calculated to break his will. 
Withholding needed medical care is another weapon in the government�s 
arsenal to seek this same end.

Prison officials at the maximum security United States Penitentiary at Terre 
Haute, Indiana, where he is held, seem to be using his high security status 
to delay needed medical treatment, at no small cost and risk to Oscar�s 
health and well-being. We have written in protest to the Harley G. Lappin, 
director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and we are calling on all people 
of conscience to join in a letter writing campaign to insist that Oscar be 
immediately provided with the medical care their own doctors have determined 
he needs.

Dear Director Lappin:

In March of 2003, a surgeon at USP Terre Haute, Dr. Taude, diagnosed Mr. 
L�pez with bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would recommend to the 
Bureau of Prisons that the hernias be surgically repaired. Since that time 
Mr. L�pez has reported to medical staff that he has increasing pain in the 
area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still able to exercise 
vigorously, but he currently unable to do so because of the pain. After 
enduring months of pain and discomfort since diagnosis, Mr. L�pez again saw 
Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez that he had 
recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the Bureau of 
Prisons to decided whether to provide the surgery.
We are concerned, based on his attorney�s consultation with qualified 
outside medical personnel, that although the hernias seem to be reducible, 
the pain is increasing, and if one of the hernias becomes stuck, the result 
could be a surgical emergency. We further understand that since he has two 
hernias, they could both be repaired at the same time so that he will have 
to recover from only one surgery, and avoiding the necessity for anesthesia 
on two occasions.

Finally, given the political nature of the acts and beliefs for which Mr. 
L�pez is in prison�fighting for the independence of Puerto Rico� we are 
concerned that prison authorities are placing an inappropriate emphasis on 
his high security status, at no small cost and risk to Mr. L�pez� health and 
well-being. We must insist that you immediately provide him with the care 
that the surgeon has already determined he needs. You can be sure that we 
will continue to monitor his situation and advocate for his human rights. 
May we please hear your response.

Sincerely yours,

Re: Oscar Lpez Rivera, 87651-024
USP Terre Haute

Dear Director Lappin:

In March of 2003, a surgeon at USP Terre Haute, Dr. Taude, diagnosed Mr.
Lpez with bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would recommend to the
Bureau of Prisons that the hernias be surgically repaired. Since that time
Mr. Lpez has reported to medical staff that he has increasing pain in the
area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still able to exercise
vigorously, but he currently unable to do so because of the pain. After
enduring months of pain and discomfort since diagnosis, Mr. Lpez again saw
Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. Lpez that he had
recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the Bureau of
Prisons to decided whether to provide the surgery.
We are concerned, based on his attorneys consultation with qualified
outside medical personnel, that although the hernias seem to be reducible,
the pain is increasing, and if one of the hernias becomes stuck, the result
could be a surgical emergency. We further understand that since he has two
hernias, they could both be repaired at the same time so that he will have
to recover from only one surgery, and avoiding the necessity for anesthesia
on two occasions.

Finally, given the political nature of the acts and beliefs for which Mr.
Lpez is in prisonfighting for the independence of Puerto Rico we are
concerned that prison authorities are placing an inappropriate emphasis on
his high security status, at no small cost and risk to Mr. Lpez health and
well-being. We must insist that you immediately provide him with the care
that the surgeon has already determined he needs. You can be sure that we
will continue to monitor his situation and advocate for his human rights.
May we please hear your response.

Sincerely yours,

Background Information on Oscar L�pez Rivera and the Puerto Rican Political 
Prisoners.
Oscar L�pez Rivera was among fifteen Puerto Rican men and women imprisoned 
in the 1980's and 1990's for their acts and beliefs in favor of Puerto Rican 
independence. The support for their release included several members of 
congress, Nobel laureates, labor leaders, the Catholic Archbishop of Puerto 
Rico, and all the major Protestant churches of Puerto Rico and many 
denominations in the US, as well as the entire political spectrum in Puerto 
Rico.

By the time most of these supporters became involved in the campaign for 
their release, the prisoners had all served over a decade in prison. The 
supporters held many different views about pacifism vs. just war and 
political status, but they agreed that that these prisoners had received 
disproportionately long sentences (ave. over 65 years) and had more than 
served whatever debt they may have owed to society.

Of those fifteen, in 1999 President Clinton commuted the sentences of 
eleven, declaring that their sentences were indeed disproportionate. Of the 
four who remain in prison, two are scheduled for release before the end of 
next year. Mr. L�pez and Carlos Alberto Torres, however, continue to face 
the equivalent of life sentences, with release dates in 2027 and 2024, 
respectively.

Most of these political prisoners, including Mr. L�pez and Mr. Torres, were 
associated with the FALN (Armed Forces of National Liberation) and were 
convicted of seditious conspiracy (the same charge for which Nelson Mandela 
was convicted, and which has been used primarily against the Puerto Rican 
independence movement). They were accused of military actions against 
corporate and military targets related to the colonial condition of Puerto 
Rico, but not of any act resulting in human injury or loss of life. Because 
they invoked the international law position as prisoners of war, insisting 
that they had a right under the Geneva Conventions to be tried by an 
international tribunal instead of by the colonial power, they did not defend 
themselves in court.

Just as their disproportionate sentences were calculated to punish them for 
their political beliefs and acts, so have their prison conditions, 
particularly in Mr. L�pez� case. For over 12 years he experienced the most 
maximum security prisons in the U.S., including USP Marion, Illinois, 
condemned by Amnesty International as violating virtually every one of the 
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and 
ADX Florence, Colorado, the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," known for interning 
those regarded by the government as "terrorists."

Since September 11, the risk to those who remain in prison has only 
increased, as the "anti-terrorist" order of the day has ushered in a harsher 
regime, making their segregation and isolation even more imminent, and 
elevating their high security status to the point where it interferes with 
needed medical care.

While those of us who sought the release of all fifteen celebrate that 
eleven have come home, we continue to strive for the heath, welfare and 
freedom of those who remain behind bars.

PICKET IN PROTEST OF THE SENTENCING OF THE VIEQUES 12  AT THE UNITED NATIONS 
RALPH BUNCHE PARK E42ND ST AND 1ST AVENUE

Join the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign on Thursday December 4th, 2003 as we 
protest the unfair and
unjust sentencing of the Vieques 12!!

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of 
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their 
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12 
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and 
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the 
U.S. Navy from Vieques.  Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in 
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest.  It is also an 
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the 
four demands of the People of Vieques 
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

We urge all people in solidarity with the Vieques cause to help us protest 
this unjust and unfair targeting of activists by the FBI in Puerto Rico.

We are calling on all organizations to endorse this activity and commit to 
mobilizing for this event!!  To endorse please email 
ProLibertad@..., call 718-601-4751!!

Re: Oscar L�pez Rivera, 87651-024

USP Terre Haute

Dear Director Lappin:
In March of 2003, a surgeon at USP Terre Haute, Dr. Taude, diagnosed Mr.
L�pez with bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would recommend to the
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that the hernias be surgically repaired. Since that
time, Mr. L�pez has reported to the medical staff that he has increasing
pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still able to
exercise vigorously, but he is currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since the diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the BOP
to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We are concerned, based on his attorney's consultation with qualified
outside medical personnel, that although the hernias seem to be reducible,
the pain is increasing, and if one of the hernias becomes stuck, the result
could be a surgical emergency. We further understand that since he has two
hernias, they could both be repaired at the same time so that he will have
to recover from only one surgery, and avoiding the necessity for anesthesia
on two occasions.

Finally, given the political nature of the acts and beliefs for which Mr.
L�pez is in prison-fighting for the independence of Puerto Rico- we are
concerned that prison authorities are placing an inappropriate emphasis on
his high security status, at no small cost and risk to Mr. L�pez' health and
well-being. We insist that you immediately provide him with the care that
the surgeon has already determined he needs. You can be sure that we will
continue to monitor his situation and advocate for his human rights. We
expect a forthcoming response.

Sincerely yours,

Name ________________________

Background Information on Oscar L�pez Rivera and the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners.
Oscar L�pez Rivera was among fifteen Puerto Rican men and women imprisoned
in the 1980's and 1990's for their acts and beliefs in favor of Puerto Rican
independence. The support for their release included several members of
congress, Nobel laureates, labor leaders, the Catholic Archbishop of Puerto
Rico, and all the major Protestant churches of Puerto Rico and many
denominations in the US, as well as the entire political spectrum in Puerto
Rico.

By the time most of these supporters became involved in the campaign for
their release, the prisoners had all served over a decade in prison. The
supporters held many different views about pacifism vs. just war and
political status, but they agreed that that these prisoners had received
disproportionately long sentences (ave. over 65 years) and had more than
served whatever debt they may have owed to society.

Of those fifteen, in 1999 President Clinton commuted the sentences of
eleven, declaring that their sentences were indeed disproportionate. Of the
four who remain in prison, two are scheduled for release before the end of
next year. Mr. L�pez and Carlos Alberto Torres, however, continue to face
the equivalent of life sentences, with release dates in 2027 and 2024,
respectively.

Most of these political prisoners, including Mr. L�pez and Mr. Torres, were
associated with the FALN (Armed Forces of National Liberation) and were
convicted of seditious conspiracy (the same charge for which Nelson Mandela
was convicted, and which has been used primarily against the Puerto Rican
independence movement). They were accused of military actions against
corporate and military targets related to the colonial condition of Puerto
Rico, but not of any act resulting in human injury or loss of life. Because
they invoked the international law position as prisoners of war, insisting
that they had a right under the Geneva Conventions to be tried by an
international tribunal instead of by the colonial power, they did not defend
themselves in court.

Just as their disproportionate sentences were calculated to punish them for
their political beliefs and acts, so have their prison conditions,
particularly in Mr. L�pez� case. For over 12 years he experienced the most
maximum security prisons in the U.S., including USP Marion, Illinois,
condemned by Amnesty International as violating virtually every one of the
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and
ADX Florence, Colorado, the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," known for interning
those regarded by the government as "terrorists."

Since September 11, the risk to those who remain in prison has only
increased, as the "anti-terrorist" order of the day has ushered in a harsher
regime, making their segregation and isolation even more imminent, and
elevating their high security status to the point where it interferes with
needed medical care.

While those of us who sought the release of all fifteen celebrate that
eleven have come home, we continue to strive for the heath, welfare and
freedom of those who remain behind bars.

PICKET IN PROTEST OF THE SENTENCING OF THE VIEQUES 12  AT THE UNITED NATIONS 
RALPH BUNCHE PARK E42ND ST AND 1ST AVENUE

Join the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign on Thursday December 4th, 2003 as we 
protest the unfair and
unjust sentencing of the Vieques 12!!

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of 
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their 
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12 
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and 
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the 
U.S. Navy from Vieques.  Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in 
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest.  It is also an 
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the 
four demands of the People of Vieques 
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

We urge all people in solidarity with the Vieques cause to help us protest 
this unjust and unfair targeting of activists by the FBI in Puerto Rico.

We are calling on all organizations to endorse this activity and commit to 
mobilizing for this event!!  To endorse please email

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is happy to support the campaign to demand
medical treatment for Oscar Lopez Rivera and to circulate this update on the
campaign. The time is critical please get these latters out and support
Oscar, we are close to a date for surgery and we need more letters out there
to increase the pressure.

GET THOSE LETTERS OUT!! CIRCUALTE THE CALL TO DEMAND MEDICAL TREATEMENT FOR
OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA!!

Dear Friends,

The COMIT� PRO DERECHOS HUMANOS DE PUERTO RICO and the BORICUA NATIONAL
HUMAN RIGHTS NETWORK would like to thank everyone for their letters, faxes,
and postcards in support of the campaign to obtain medical care for Oscar
L�pez Rivera. We know that many people in Puerto Rico, Boston, Camden,
Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington DC,
and other areas have already participated in this effort.

We have just received word that on October 27, 2003, Oscar was taken to the
infirmary and shown the letters that had come in. He was told that the
letters were unnecessary because the surgery was already approved, but he
was not given a date. He was also told that they would only operate on one
of his two hernias.

We need to keep the pressure on to make sure that Oscar is given a date
immediately, and that both hernias are safely and successfully repaired.

The original press release and sample letter are enclosed in case you do not
have them.

With many thanks for your solidarity and support!

PRESS RELEASE
October 21, 2003

The health and well being of Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar L�pez
Rivera is at this moment at risk. Last March, Dr. Taude, a surgeon at USP
Terre Haute, diagnosed bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would
recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that the hernias be surgically repaired.
Since that time Mr. L�pez has reported to medical staff that he has
increasing pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still
able to exercise vigorously, but he currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the
Bureau of Prisons to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We have consulted with physicians who inform us that although the hernias
seem to be reducible, with the increasing pain, one of the two hernias might
become stuck, which could result in a surgical emergency.

Oscar, serving a 70 year sentence, is not eligible for release until 2027.
For more than half of his 22 years in prison, he was held in the most
maximum security prisons in the United States in the strictest solitary
confinement, politically punitive conditions calculated to break his will.
Withholding needed medical care is another weapon in the government�s
arsenal to seek this same end.

Prison officials at the maximum security United States Penitentiary at Terre
Haute, Indiana, where he is held, seem to be using his high security status
to delay needed medical treatment, at no small cost and risk to Oscar�s
health and well-being. We have written in protest to the Harley G. Lappin,
director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and we are calling on all people
of conscience to join in a letter writing campaign to insist that Oscar be
immediately provided with the medical care their own doctors have determined
he needs.

PICKET IN PROTEST OF THE SENTENCING OF THE VIEQUES 12  AT THE UNITED NATIONS
RALPH BUNCHE PARK E42ND ST AND 1ST AVENUE

Join the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign on Thursday December 4th, 2003 as we
protest the unfair and unjust sentencing of the Vieques 12!!

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the
U.S. Navy from Vieques.  Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest.  It is also an
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the
four demands of the People of Vieques
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

We urge all people in solidarity with the Vieques cause to help us protest
this unjust and unfair targeting of activists by the FBI in Puerto Rico.

We are calling on all organizations to endorse this activity and commit to
mobilizing for this event!!  To endorse please email

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is happy to support the campaign to demand
medical treatment for Oscar Lopez Rivera and to circulate this update on the
campaign. The time is critical please get these latters out and support
Oscar, we are close to a date for surgery and we need more letters out there
to increase the pressure.

GET THOSE LETTERS OUT!! CIRCULATE THE CALL TO DEMAND MEDICAL TREATEMENT FOR
OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA!!

Dear Friends,

The COMIT� PRO DERECHOS HUMANOS DE PUERTO RICO and the BORICUA NATIONAL
HUMAN RIGHTS NETWORK would like to thank everyone for their letters, faxes,
and postcards in support of the campaign to obtain medical care for Oscar
L�pez Rivera. We know that many people in Puerto Rico, Boston, Camden,
Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington DC,
and other areas have already participated in this effort.

We have just received word that on October 27, 2003, Oscar was taken to the
infirmary and shown the letters that had come in. He was told that the
letters were unnecessary because the surgery was already approved, but he
was not given a date. He was also told that they would only operate on one
of his two hernias.

We need to keep the pressure on to make sure that Oscar is given a date
immediately, and that both hernias are safely and successfully repaired.

The original press release and sample letter are enclosed in case you do not
have them.

With many thanks for your solidarity and support!

PRESS RELEASE
October 21, 2003

The health and well being of Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar L�pez
Rivera is at this moment at risk. Last March, Dr. Taude, a surgeon at USP
Terre Haute, diagnosed bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would
recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that the hernias be surgically repaired.
Since that time Mr. L�pez has reported to medical staff that he has
increasing pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still
able to exercise vigorously, but he currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the
Bureau of Prisons to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We have consulted with physicians who inform us that although the hernias
seem to be reducible, with the increasing pain, one of the two hernias might
become stuck, which could result in a surgical emergency.

Oscar, serving a 70 year sentence, is not eligible for release until 2027.
For more than half of his 22 years in prison, he was held in the most
maximum security prisons in the United States in the strictest solitary
confinement, politically punitive conditions calculated to break his will.
Withholding needed medical care is another weapon in the government�s
arsenal to seek this same end.

Prison officials at the maximum security United States Penitentiary at Terre
Haute, Indiana, where he is held, seem to be using his high security status
to delay needed medical treatment, at no small cost and risk to Oscar�s
health and well-being. We have written in protest to the Harley G. Lappin,
director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and we are calling on all people
of conscience to join in a letter writing campaign to insist that Oscar be
immediately provided with the medical care their own doctors have determined
he needs.

Re: Oscar L�pez Rivera, 87651-024

USP Terre Haute

Dear Director Lappin:
In March of 2003, a surgeon at USP Terre Haute, Dr. Taude, diagnosed Mr.
L�pez with bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would recommend to the
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that the hernias be surgically repaired. Since that
time, Mr. L�pez has reported to the medical staff that he has increasing
pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still able to
exercise vigorously, but he is currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since the diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the BOP
to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We are concerned, based on his attorney's consultation with qualified
outside medical personnel, that although the hernias seem to be reducible,
the pain is increasing, and if one of the hernias becomes stuck, the result
could be a surgical emergency. We further understand that since he has two
hernias, they could both be repaired at the same time so that he will have
to recover from only one surgery, and avoiding the necessity for anesthesia
on two occasions.

Finally, given the political nature of the acts and beliefs for which Mr.
L�pez is in prison-fighting for the independence of Puerto Rico- we are
concerned that prison authorities are placing an inappropriate emphasis on
his high security status, at no small cost and risk to Mr. L�pez' health and
well-being. We insist that you immediately provide him with the care that
the surgeon has already determined he needs. You can be sure that we will
continue to monitor his situation and advocate for his human rights. We
expect a forthcoming response.

Sincerely yours,

Name ________________________

********************************************************************************

Background Information on Oscar L�pez Rivera and the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners.
Oscar L�pez Rivera was among fifteen Puerto Rican men and women imprisoned
in the 1980's and 1990's for their acts and beliefs in favor of Puerto Rican
independence. The support for their release included several members of
congress, Nobel laureates, labor leaders, the Catholic Archbishop of Puerto
Rico, and all the major Protestant churches of Puerto Rico and many
denominations in the US, as well as the entire political spectrum in Puerto
Rico.

By the time most of these supporters became involved in the campaign for
their release, the prisoners had all served over a decade in prison. The
supporters held many different views about pacifism vs. just war and
political status, but they agreed that that these prisoners had received
disproportionately long sentences (ave. over 65 years) and had more than
served whatever debt they may have owed to society.

Of those fifteen, in 1999 President Clinton commuted the sentences of
eleven, declaring that their sentences were indeed disproportionate. Of the
four who remain in prison, two are scheduled for release before the end of
next year. Mr. L�pez and Carlos Alberto Torres, however, continue to face
the equivalent of life sentences, with release dates in 2027 and 2024,
respectively.

Most of these political prisoners, including Mr. L�pez and Mr. Torres, were
associated with the FALN (Armed Forces of National Liberation) and were
convicted of seditious conspiracy (the same charge for which Nelson Mandela
was convicted, and which has been used primarily against the Puerto Rican
independence movement). They were accused of military actions against
corporate and military targets related to the colonial condition of Puerto
Rico, but not of any act resulting in human injury or loss of life. Because
they invoked the international law position as prisoners of war, insisting
that they had a right under the Geneva Conventions to be tried by an
international tribunal instead of by the colonial power, they did not defend
themselves in court.

Just as their disproportionate sentences were calculated to punish them for
their political beliefs and acts, so have their prison conditions,
particularly in Mr. L�pez� case. For over 12 years he experienced the most
maximum security prisons in the U.S., including USP Marion, Illinois,
condemned by Amnesty International as violating virtually every one of the
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and
ADX Florence, Colorado, the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," known for interning
those regarded by the government as "terrorists."

Since September 11, the risk to those who remain in prison has only
increased, as the "anti-terrorist" order of the day has ushered in a harsher
regime, making their segregation and isolation even more imminent, and
elevating their high security status to the point where it interferes with
needed medical care.

While those of us who sought the release of all fifteen celebrate that
eleven have come home, we continue to strive for the heath, welfare and
freedom of those who remain behind bars.

Background Information on Oscar L�pez Rivera and the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners.
Oscar L�pez Rivera was among fifteen Puerto Rican men and women imprisoned
in the 1980's and 1990's for their acts and beliefs in favor of Puerto Rican
independence. The support for their release included several members of
congress, Nobel laureates, labor leaders, the Catholic Archbishop of Puerto
Rico, and all the major Protestant churches of Puerto Rico and many
denominations in the US, as well as the entire political spectrum in Puerto
Rico.

By the time most of these supporters became involved in the campaign for
their release, the prisoners had all served over a decade in prison. The
supporters held many different views about pacifism vs. just war and
political status, but they agreed that that these prisoners had received
disproportionately long sentences (ave. over 65 years) and had more than
served whatever debt they may have owed to society.

Of those fifteen, in 1999 President Clinton commuted the sentences of
eleven, declaring that their sentences were indeed disproportionate. Of the
four who remain in prison, two are scheduled for release before the end of
next year. Mr. L�pez and Carlos Alberto Torres, however, continue to face
the equivalent of life sentences, with release dates in 2027 and 2024,
respectively.

Most of these political prisoners, including Mr. L�pez and Mr. Torres, were
associated with the FALN (Armed Forces of National Liberation) and were
convicted of seditious conspiracy (the same charge for which Nelson Mandela
was convicted, and which has been used primarily against the Puerto Rican
independence movement). They were accused of military actions against
corporate and military targets related to the colonial condition of Puerto
Rico, but not of any act resulting in human injury or loss of life. Because
they invoked the international law position as prisoners of war, insisting
that they had a right under the Geneva Conventions to be tried by an
international tribunal instead of by the colonial power, they did not defend
themselves in court.

Just as their disproportionate sentences were calculated to punish them for
their political beliefs and acts, so have their prison conditions,
particularly in Mr. L�pez� case. For over 12 years he experienced the most
maximum security prisons in the U.S., including USP Marion, Illinois,
condemned by Amnesty International as violating virtually every one of the
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and
ADX Florence, Colorado, the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," known for interning
those regarded by the government as "terrorists."

Since September 11, the risk to those who remain in prison has only
increased, as the "anti-terrorist" order of the day has ushered in a harsher
regime, making their segregation and isolation even more imminent, and
elevating their high security status to the point where it interferes with
needed medical care.

While those of us who sought the release of all fifteen celebrate that
eleven have come home, we continue to strive for the heath, welfare and
freedom of those who remain behind bars.

RALPH BUNCHE PARK E42ND ST AND 1ST AVENUE

Join the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign on Thursday December 4th, 2003 as we
protest the unfair and unjust sentencing of the Vieques 12!!

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the
U.S. Navy from Vieques. Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest. It is also an
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the
four demands of the People of Vieques
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

We urge all people in solidarity with the Vieques cause to help us protest
this unjust and unfair targeting of activists by the FBI in Puerto Rico.

We are calling on all organizations to endorse this activity and commit to
mobilizing for this event!! To endorse please email

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is happy to support the campaign to demand
medical treatment for Oscar Lopez Rivera and to circulate this update on the
campaign. The time is critical please get these latters out and support
Oscar, we are close to a date for surgery and we need more letters out there
to increase the pressure.

GET THOSE LETTERS OUT!! CIRCULATE THE CALL TO DEMAND MEDICAL TREATEMENT FOR
OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA!!

Dear Friends,

The COMIT� PRO DERECHOS HUMANOS DE PUERTO RICO and the BORICUA NATIONAL
HUMAN RIGHTS NETWORK would like to thank everyone for their letters, faxes,
and postcards in support of the campaign to obtain medical care for Oscar
L�pez Rivera. We know that many people in Puerto Rico, Boston, Camden,
Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington DC,
and other areas have already participated in this effort.

We have just received word that on October 27, 2003, Oscar was taken to the
infirmary and shown the letters that had come in. He was told that the
letters were unnecessary because the surgery was already approved, but he
was not given a date. He was also told that they would only operate on one
of his two hernias.

We need to keep the pressure on to make sure that Oscar is given a date
immediately, and that both hernias are safely and successfully repaired.

The original press release and sample letter are enclosed in case you do not
have them.

With many thanks for your solidarity and support!

PRESS RELEASE
October 21, 2003

The health and well being of Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar L�pez
Rivera is at this moment at risk. Last March, Dr. Taude, a surgeon at USP
Terre Haute, diagnosed bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would
recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that the hernias be surgically repaired.
Since that time Mr. L�pez has reported to medical staff that he has
increasing pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still
able to exercise vigorously, but he currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the
Bureau of Prisons to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We have consulted with physicians who inform us that although the hernias
seem to be reducible, with the increasing pain, one of the two hernias might
become stuck, which could result in a surgical emergency.

Oscar, serving a 70 year sentence, is not eligible for release until 2027.
For more than half of his 22 years in prison, he was held in the most
maximum security prisons in the United States in the strictest solitary
confinement, politically punitive conditions calculated to break his will.
Withholding needed medical care is another weapon in the government�s
arsenal to seek this same end.

Prison officials at the maximum security United States Penitentiary at Terre
Haute, Indiana, where he is held, seem to be using his high security status
to delay needed medical treatment, at no small cost and risk to Oscar�s
health and well-being. We have written in protest to the Harley G. Lappin,
director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and we are calling on all people
of conscience to join in a letter writing campaign to insist that Oscar be
immediately provided with the medical care their own doctors have determined
he needs.

Re: Oscar L�pez Rivera, 87651-024

USP Terre Haute

Dear Director Lappin:
In March of 2003, a surgeon at USP Terre Haute, Dr. Taude, diagnosed Mr.
L�pez with bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would recommend to the
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that the hernias be surgically repaired. Since that
time, Mr. L�pez has reported to the medical staff that he has increasing
pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still able to
exercise vigorously, but he is currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since the diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the BOP
to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We are concerned, based on his attorney's consultation with qualified
outside medical personnel, that although the hernias seem to be reducible,
the pain is increasing, and if one of the hernias becomes stuck, the result
could be a surgical emergency. We further understand that since he has two
hernias, they could both be repaired at the same time so that he will have
to recover from only one surgery, and avoiding the necessity for anesthesia
on two occasions.

Finally, given the political nature of the acts and beliefs for which Mr.
L�pez is in prison-fighting for the independence of Puerto Rico- we are
concerned that prison authorities are placing an inappropriate emphasis on
his high security status, at no small cost and risk to Mr. L�pez' health and
well-being. We insist that you immediately provide him with the care that
the surgeon has already determined he needs. You can be sure that we will
continue to monitor his situation and advocate for his human rights. We
expect a forthcoming response.

that they had a right under the Geneva Conventions to be tried by an
international tribunal instead of by the colonial power, they did not defend
themselves in court.

Just as their disproportionate sentences were calculated to punish them for
their political beliefs and acts, so have their prison conditions,
particularly in Mr. L�pez� case. For over 12 years he experienced the most
maximum security prisons in the U.S., including USP Marion, Illinois,
condemned by Amnesty International as violating virtually every one of the
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and
ADX Florence, Colorado, the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," known for interning
those regarded by the government as "terrorists."

Since September 11, the risk to those who remain in prison has only
increased, as the "anti-terrorist" order of the day has ushered in a harsher
regime, making their segregation and isolation even more imminent, and
elevating their high security status to the point where it interferes with
needed medical care.

While those of us who sought the release of all fifteen celebrate that
eleven have come home, we continue to strive for the heath, welfare and
freedom of those who remain behind bars.

PICKET IN PROTEST OF THE SENTENCING OF THE VIEQUES 12 AT THE UNITED NATIONS
RALPH BUNCHE PARK E42ND ST AND 1ST AVENUE

Join the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign on Thursday December 4th, 2003 as we
protest the unfair and unjust sentencing of the Vieques 12!!

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the
U.S. Navy from Vieques. Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest. It is also an
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the
four demands of the People of Vieques
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

We urge all people in solidarity with the Vieques cause to help us protest
this unjust and unfair targeting of activists by the FBI in Puerto Rico.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is happy to support the campaign to demand
medical treatment for Oscar Lopez Rivera and to circulate this update on the
campaign. The time is critical please get these latters out and support
Oscar, we are close to a date for surgery and we need more letters out there
to increase the pressure.

GET THOSE LETTERS OUT!! CIRCULATE THE CALL TO DEMAND MEDICAL TREATEMENT FOR
OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA!!

Dear Friends,

The COMIT� PRO DERECHOS HUMANOS DE PUERTO RICO and the BORICUA NATIONAL
HUMAN RIGHTS NETWORK would like to thank everyone for their letters, faxes,
and postcards in support of the campaign to obtain medical care for Oscar
L�pez Rivera. We know that many people in Puerto Rico, Boston, Camden,
Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington DC,
and other areas have already participated in this effort.

We have just received word that on October 27, 2003, Oscar was taken to the
infirmary and shown the letters that had come in. He was told that the
letters were unnecessary because the surgery was already approved, but he
was not given a date. He was also told that they would only operate on one
of his two hernias.

We need to keep the pressure on to make sure that Oscar is given a date
immediately, and that both hernias are safely and successfully repaired.

The original press release and sample letter are enclosed in case you do not
have them.

With many thanks for your solidarity and support!

PRESS RELEASE
October 21, 2003

The health and well being of Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar L�pez
Rivera is at this moment at risk. Last March, Dr. Taude, a surgeon at USP
Terre Haute, diagnosed bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would
recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that the hernias be surgically repaired.
Since that time Mr. L�pez has reported to medical staff that he has
increasing pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still
able to exercise vigorously, but he currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the
Bureau of Prisons to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We have consulted with physicians who inform us that although the hernias
seem to be reducible, with the increasing pain, one of the two hernias might
become stuck, which could result in a surgical emergency.

Oscar, serving a 70 year sentence, is not eligible for release until 2027.
For more than half of his 22 years in prison, he was held in the most
maximum security prisons in the United States in the strictest solitary
confinement, politically punitive conditions calculated to break his will.
Withholding needed medical care is another weapon in the government�s
arsenal to seek this same end.

Prison officials at the maximum security United States Penitentiary at Terre
Haute, Indiana, where he is held, seem to be using his high security status
to delay needed medical treatment, at no small cost and risk to Oscar�s
health and well-being. We have written in protest to the Harley G. Lappin,
director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and we are calling on all people
of conscience to join in a letter writing campaign to insist that Oscar be
immediately provided with the medical care their own doctors have determined
he needs.

Re: Oscar L�pez Rivera, 87651-024

USP Terre Haute

Dear Director Lappin:
In March of 2003, a surgeon at USP Terre Haute, Dr. Taude, diagnosed Mr.
L�pez with bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would recommend to the
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that the hernias be surgically repaired. Since that
time, Mr. L�pez has reported to the medical staff that he has increasing
pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still able to
exercise vigorously, but he is currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since the diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the BOP
to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We are concerned, based on his attorney's consultation with qualified
outside medical personnel, that although the hernias seem to be reducible,
the pain is increasing, and if one of the hernias becomes stuck, the result
could be a surgical emergency. We further understand that since he has two
hernias, they could both be repaired at the same time so that he will have
to recover from only one surgery, and avoiding the necessity for anesthesia
on two occasions.

Finally, given the political nature of the acts and beliefs for which Mr.
L�pez is in prison-fighting for the independence of Puerto Rico- we are
concerned that prison authorities are placing an inappropriate emphasis on
his high security status, at no small cost and risk to Mr. L�pez' health and
well-being. We insist that you immediately provide him with the care that
the surgeon has already determined he needs. You can be sure that we will
continue to monitor his situation and advocate for his human rights. We
expect a forthcoming response.

Sincerely yours,

Background Information on Oscar L�pez Rivera and the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners.
Oscar L�pez Rivera was among fifteen Puerto Rican men and women imprisoned
in the 1980's and 1990's for their acts and beliefs in favor of Puerto Rican
independence. The support for their release included several members of
congress, Nobel laureates, labor leaders, the Catholic Archbishop of Puerto
Rico, and all the major Protestant churches of Puerto Rico and many
denominations in the US, as well as the entire political spectrum in Puerto
Rico.

By the time most of these supporters became involved in the campaign for
their release, the prisoners had all served over a decade in prison. The
supporters held many different views about pacifism vs. just war and
political status, but they agreed that that these prisoners had received
disproportionately long sentences (ave. over 65 years) and had more than
served whatever debt they may have owed to society.

Of those fifteen, in 1999 President Clinton commuted the sentences of
eleven, declaring that their sentences were indeed disproportionate. Of the
four who remain in prison, two are scheduled for release before the end of
next year. Mr. L�pez and Carlos Alberto Torres, however, continue to face
the equivalent of life sentences, with release dates in 2027 and 2024,
respectively.

Most of these political prisoners, including Mr. L�pez and Mr. Torres, were
associated with the FALN (Armed Forces of National Liberation) and were
convicted of seditious conspiracy (the same charge for which Nelson Mandela
was convicted, and which has been used primarily against the Puerto Rican
independence movement). They were accused of military actions against
corporate and military targets related to the colonial condition of Puerto
Rico, but not of any act resulting in human injury or loss of life. Because
they invoked the international law position as prisoners of war, insisting
that they had a right under the Geneva Conventions to be tried by an
international tribunal instead of by the colonial power, they did not defend
themselves in court.

Just as their disproportionate sentences were calculated to punish them for
their political beliefs and acts, so have their prison conditions,
particularly in Mr. L�pez� case. For over 12 years he experienced the most

PICKET IN PROTEST OF THE SENTENCING OF THE VIEQUES 12 AT THE UNITED NATIONS
RALPH BUNCHE PARK E42ND ST AND 1ST AVENUE

Join the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign on Thursday December 4th, 2003 as we
protest the unfair and unjust sentencing of the Vieques 12!!

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the
U.S. Navy from Vieques. Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest. It is also an
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the
four demands of the People of Vieques
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

We urge all people in solidarity with the Vieques cause to help us protest
this unjust and unfair targeting of activists by the FBI in Puerto Rico.

We are calling on all organizations to endorse this activity and commit to
mobilizing for this event!! To endorse please email

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is happy to support the campaign to demand
medical treatment for Oscar Lopez Rivera and to circulate this update on the
campaign. The time is critical please get these latters out and support
Oscar, we are close to a date for surgery and we need more letters out there
to increase the pressure.

GET THOSE LETTERS OUT!! CIRCULATE THE CALL TO DEMAND MEDICAL TREATEMENT FOR
OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA!!

Dear Friends,

The COMIT� PRO DERECHOS HUMANOS DE PUERTO RICO and the BORICUA NATIONAL
HUMAN RIGHTS NETWORK would like to thank everyone for their letters, faxes,
and postcards in support of the campaign to obtain medical care for Oscar
L�pez Rivera. We know that many people in Puerto Rico, Boston, Camden,
Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington DC,
and other areas have already participated in this effort.

We have just received word that on October 27, 2003, Oscar was taken to the
infirmary and shown the letters that had come in. He was told that the
letters were unnecessary because the surgery was already approved, but he
was not given a date. He was also told that they would only operate on one
of his two hernias.

We need to keep the pressure on to make sure that Oscar is given a date
immediately, and that both hernias are safely and successfully repaired.

The original press release and sample letter are enclosed in case you do not
have them.

With many thanks for your solidarity and support!

PRESS RELEASE
October 21, 2003

The health and well being of Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar L�pez
Rivera is at this moment at risk. Last March, Dr. Taude, a surgeon at USP
Terre Haute, diagnosed bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would
recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that the hernias be surgically repaired.
Since that time Mr. L�pez has reported to medical staff that he has
increasing pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still
able to exercise vigorously, but he currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the
Bureau of Prisons to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We have consulted with physicians who inform us that although the hernias
seem to be reducible, with the increasing pain, one of the two hernias might
become stuck, which could result in a surgical emergency.

Oscar, serving a 70 year sentence, is not eligible for release until 2027.
For more than half of his 22 years in prison, he was held in the most
maximum security prisons in the United States in the strictest solitary
confinement, politically punitive conditions calculated to break his will.
Withholding needed medical care is another weapon in the government�s
arsenal to seek this same end.

Prison officials at the maximum security United States Penitentiary at Terre
Haute, Indiana, where he is held, seem to be using his high security status
to delay needed medical treatment, at no small cost and risk to Oscar�s
health and well-being. We have written in protest to the Harley G. Lappin,
director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and we are calling on all people
of conscience to join in a letter writing campaign to insist that Oscar be
immediately provided with the medical care their own doctors have determined
he needs.

Re: Oscar L�pez Rivera, 87651-024

USP Terre Haute

Dear Director Lappin:
In March of 2003, a surgeon at USP Terre Haute, Dr. Taude, diagnosed Mr.
L�pez with bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would recommend to the
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that the hernias be surgically repaired. Since that
time, Mr. L�pez has reported to the medical staff that he has increasing
pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still able to
exercise vigorously, but he is currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since the diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the BOP
to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We are concerned, based on his attorney's consultation with qualified
outside medical personnel, that although the hernias seem to be reducible,
the pain is increasing, and if one of the hernias becomes stuck, the result
could be a surgical emergency. We further understand that since he has two
hernias, they could both be repaired at the same time so that he will have
to recover from only one surgery, and avoiding the necessity for anesthesia
on two occasions.

Finally, given the political nature of the acts and beliefs for which Mr.
L�pez is in prison-fighting for the independence of Puerto Rico- we are
concerned that prison authorities are placing an inappropriate emphasis on
his high security status, at no small cost and risk to Mr. L�pez' health and
well-being. We insist that you immediately provide him with the care that
the surgeon has already determined he needs. You can be sure that we will
continue to monitor his situation and advocate for his human rights. We
expect a forthcoming response.

Sincerely yours,

Name ________________________

********************************************************************************

Background Information on Oscar L�pez Rivera and the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners.
Oscar L�pez Rivera was among fifteen Puerto Rican men and women imprisoned
in the 1980's and 1990's for their acts and beliefs in favor of Puerto Rican
independence. The support for their release included several members of
congress, Nobel laureates, labor leaders, the Catholic Archbishop of Puerto
Rico, and all the major Protestant churches of Puerto Rico and many
denominations in the US, as well as the entire political spectrum in Puerto
Rico.

By the time most of these supporters became involved in the campaign for
their release, the prisoners had all served over a decade in prison. The
supporters held many different views about pacifism vs. just war and
political status, but they agreed that that these prisoners had received
disproportionately long sentences (ave. over 65 years) and had more than
served whatever debt they may have owed to society.

Of those fifteen, in 1999 President Clinton commuted the sentences of
eleven, declaring that their sentences were indeed disproportionate. Of the
four who remain in prison, two are scheduled for release before the end of
next year. Mr. L�pez and Carlos Alberto Torres, however, continue to face
the equivalent of life sentences, with release dates in 2027 and 2024,
respectively.

Most of these political prisoners, including Mr. L�pez and Mr. Torres, were
associated with the FALN (Armed Forces of National Liberation) and were
convicted of seditious conspiracy (the same charge for which Nelson Mandela
was convicted, and which has been used primarily against the Puerto Rican
independence movement). They were accused of military actions against
corporate and military targets related to the colonial condition of Puerto
Rico, but not of any act resulting in human injury or loss of life. Because
they invoked the international law position as prisoners of war, insisting
that they had a right under the Geneva Conventions to be tried by an
international tribunal instead of by the colonial power, they did not defend
themselves in court.

Just as their disproportionate sentences were calculated to punish them for
their political beliefs and acts, so have their prison conditions,
particularly in Mr. L�pez� case. For over 12 years he experienced the most
maximum security prisons in the U.S., including USP Marion, Illinois,
condemned by Amnesty International as violating virtually every one of the
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and
ADX Florence, Colorado, the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," known for interning
those regarded by the government as "terrorists."

Since September 11, the risk to those who remain in prison has only
increased, as the "anti-terrorist" order of the day has ushered in a harsher
regime, making their segregation and isolation even more imminent, and
elevating their high security status to the point where it interferes with
needed medical care.

While those of us who sought the release of all fifteen celebrate that
eleven have come home, we continue to strive for the heath, welfare and
freedom of those who remain behind bars.

The MILITANT LABOR FORUM presents: The fight to free all Puerto Rican 
Political Prisoners

On June 25, 12 activists in the movement that forced the U.S. Navy to leave 
the small Puerto Rican island of Vieques were arrested by FBI agents.  They 
face up to 20 years in prison on charges of conspiracy to destroy federal 
property stemming from their participation in a celebration of the U.S. 
Navy�s departure from Vieques on May 1, 2003, when residents pushed down the 
perimeter fence and poured through the gate of the abandoned Camp Garc�a 
base.  For over six decades the U.S. Navy occupied two thirds of Vieques and 
used it for artillery and bombing practice, along with military maneuvers, 
driving the residents off their land.  The Vieques12 are the latest in a 
long line of Puerto Rican patriots Washington has sought to imprison for the 
crime of fighting against U.S. colonial domination.  The U.S. rulers have 
used long prison terms to try to undercut that fight both on the island and 
in the United States.  Despite the international campaign that freed 11 
indenpendentista fighters in 1999, Oscar L�pez, Juan Segarra Palmer, Hayd�e 
Beltr�n, Carlos Alberto Torres and Antonio Camacho Negr�n remain locked up 
in U.S. prisons.  Join a discussion on why working people in the U.S. should 
support the fight for Puerto Rican independence and demand that all Puerto 
Rican political prisoners be freed.

On Thursday December 4th, The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign, along with 
100-150 campaign allies, protested the incarcerations and sentencing of the 
Vieques 12 at the United Nations.

The picket called for 5:30pm and was  a militant and spirited demonstration, 
which was endorsed by over 35 organizations based in New York City and 
Puerto Rico.  The picketers chanted, �Free the Vieques 12� and, �U.S. Navy 
Clean up Vieques!!�, as they picketed in Ralph Bunche Park across the street 
from the main entrance to the United Nations.

The people of Vieques and Puerto Rico also protested the sentencing of the 
Vieques 12 by organizing a picket of over 30 people from Vieques with 
several other supporters from main land Puerto Rico.  The demonstration 
began at 12:30pm in front of the Federal Court in San Juan and lasted until 
the end of the sentencing at 3pm.

With the recent U.S. war in Iraq, the issues of militarization, 
self-determination and independence have once again become a priority for 
the International community.

The growing U.S. interventionist agenda is not a new phenomenon and must be 
challenged now more than ever.

ProLibertad organized the picket in front of the United Nations in order to 
call upon the nations of the world to speak out and denounce U.S. colonial 
control of Puerto Rico and the repressive  measures that United States 
undertakes to repress people fighting for freedom and self-determination. 
Vieques, Puerto Rico, has been utilized both to reinforce U.S. colonialism 
in Puerto Rico and as a training ground for its military intervention 
abroad.

On May 1, 2003, the U.S. Navy was forced to stop its bombing in Vieques and 
to close the bombing range.  Twelve Viequenses were arrested by the F.B.I. 
and are facing more than between 5 and 10 years in jail.  Today, these 
Boricuas are being sentenced by the Federal Court in Puerto Rico.  The 
Vieques 12 are an example of the United States incarcerating  activists  to 
punish them for the work they have done to stop the bombing in Vieques.  It 
is also an intimidation tactic to send a message to the Puerto Rican people 
and all those who fight for de-militarization that their work will result in 
incarceration and increased repression.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is launching a new campaign to bring the 
issue of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, the militariy presence in 
Vieques and Puerto Rican Colonialism to the United Nations General Assembly 
and other International Human Rights Forums.  The campaign�s main goal is to 
generate international solidarity and support for the freedom of the Puerto 
Rican Political Prisoners, and for the de-colonization of Puerto Rico.

This international campaign will begin on a local level with ProLibertad 
working with various organizations and campaigns to educate, organize and 
mobilize all communities to support the freedom of Puerto Rico and the 
Puerto Rican Political Prisoners.

Puerto Rico�s colonial reality is an international human rights violation; 
it is an example of the United States imperialistic tendencies and its 
complete disregard for the human rights and well being of other people.  The 
United States interventionist agenda that colonized Puerto Rico over 105 
years ago, is currently occupying Iraq and threatening the autonomy of Cuba 
and North Korea.  ProLibertad seeks to unify all forces in solidarity with 
Puerto Rico and to form a powerful anti-colonial human rights campaign.
_______________________________________________________________________________

On May 1st, 2003, the Puerto Rican people won a decisive victory against the 
U.S. Navy and the U.S. government.  After decades of struggle, organizing, 
civil disobedience and solidarity work, the people of Vieques forced the 
U.S. Navy to cease using the Eastern portion of Vieques as their bombing 
range.

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of 
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their 
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12 
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and 
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the 
U.S. Navy from Vieques.  Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in 
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest.  It is also an 
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the 
four demands of the People of Vieques 
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

Jos� P�rez Gonzalez (#21519-069) and Jos� V�lez Acosta (#23883-069) are in 
the Federal Prison in Puerto Rico in relation to actions on Vieques last May 
first.

Five of those arrested for the incidents of May 1st in Vieques during the 
celebration over the Navy's departure, were senteced today by Judge Jos� A. 
Fust� of the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico. All five had pled guily on 
advice of their counsel.

The sentences were as follows:

Nilda Medina, of the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques, 
was sentenced to one year on probation, 200 hours of community work, and was 
fined $2,000;

Jes�s Delgado, former president of the Teachers' Federation, was sentenced 
to 24 months on probation, nine of which he'll have to serve under house 
arrest, and was fined $3,000;

N�stor de Jes�s Guishard, a young Vieques activist, was sentenced to eight 
months in prison and a year on probation;

Heriberto Hern�ndez was sentenced to four months in prison, two years on 
conditional release, and was fined $3,000;

Manuel P�rez Santiago was sentenced to 12 months on probation and fined 
$3,000.

Jose Perez Gonzalez will be sentenced on Thursday December 11th, 2003.  A 
jury found him guilty of destruction of federal property and conspiracy, he 
faces five years or more in jail.

_______________________________________________________________________________

On Thursday December 4th, The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign, along with 
100-150 campaign allies, protested the incarcerations and sentencing of the 
Vieques 12 at the United Nations.

The picket called for 5:30pm and was  a militant and spirited demonstration, 
which was endorsed by over 35 organizations based in New York City and 
Puerto Rico.  The picketers chanted, �Free the Vieques 12� and, �U.S. Navy 
Clean up Vieques!!�, as they picketed in Ralph Bunche Park across the street 
from the main entrance to the United Nations.

The people of Vieques and Puerto Rico also protested the sentencing of the 
Vieques 12 by organizing a picket of over 30 people from Vieques with 
several other supporters from main land Puerto Rico.  The demonstration 
began at 12:30pm in front of the Federal Court in San Juan and lasted until 
the end of the sentencing at 3pm.

With the recent U.S. war in Iraq, the issues of militarization, 
self-determination and independence have once again become a priority for 
the International community.

The growing U.S. interventionist agenda is not a new phenomenon and must be 
challenged now more than ever.

ProLibertad organized the picket in front of the United Nations in order to 
call upon the nations of the world to speak out and denounce U.S. colonial 
control of Puerto Rico and the repressive  measures that United States 
undertakes to repress people fighting for freedom and self-determination. 
Vieques, Puerto Rico, has been utilized both to reinforce U.S. colonialism 
in Puerto Rico and as a training ground for its military intervention 
abroad.

On May 1, 2003, the U.S. Navy was forced to stop its bombing in Vieques and 
to close the bombing range.  Twelve Viequenses were arrested by the F.B.I. 
and are facing more than between 5 and 10 years in jail.  Today, these 
Boricuas are being sentenced by the Federal Court in Puerto Rico.  The 
Vieques 12 are an example of the United States incarcerating  activists  to 
punish them for the work they have done to stop the bombing in Vieques.  It 
is also an intimidation tactic to send a message to the Puerto Rican people 
and all those who fight for de-militarization that their work will result in 
incarceration and increased repression.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is launching a new campaign to bring the 
issue of the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, the militariy presence in 
Vieques and Puerto Rican Colonialism to the United Nations General Assembly 
and other International Human Rights Forums.  The campaign�s main goal is to 
generate international solidarity and support for the freedom of the Puerto 
Rican Political Prisoners, and for the de-colonization of Puerto Rico.

This international campaign will begin on a local level with ProLibertad 
working with various organizations and campaigns to educate, organize and 
mobilize all communities to support the freedom of Puerto Rico and the 
Puerto Rican Political Prisoners.

Puerto Rico�s colonial reality is an international human rights violation; 
it is an example of the United States imperialistic tendencies and its 
complete disregard for the human rights and well being of other people.  The 
United States interventionist agenda that colonized Puerto Rico over 105 
years ago, is currently occupying Iraq and threatening the autonomy of Cuba 
and North Korea.  ProLibertad seeks to unify all forces in solidarity with 
Puerto Rico and to form a powerful anti-colonial human rights campaign.
_______________________________________________________________________________

On May 1st, 2003, the Puerto Rican people won a decisive victory against the 
U.S. Navy and the U.S. government.  After decades of struggle, organizing, 
civil disobedience and solidarity work, the people of Vieques forced the 
U.S. Navy to cease using the Eastern portion of Vieques as their bombing 
range.

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of 
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their 
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12 
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and 
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the 
U.S. Navy from Vieques.  Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in

Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington DC,
and other areas have already participated in this effort.

We have just received word that on October 27, 2003, Oscar was taken to the
infirmary and shown the letters that had come in. He was told that the
letters were unnecessary because the surgery was already approved, but he
was not given a date. He was also told that they would only operate on one
of his two hernias.

We need to keep the pressure on to make sure that Oscar is given a date
immediately, and that both hernias are safely and successfully repaired.

The original press release and sample letter are enclosed in case you do not
have them.

With many thanks for your solidarity and support!

PRESS RELEASE
October 21, 2003

The health and well being of Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar L�pez
Rivera is at this moment at risk. Last March, Dr. Taude, a surgeon at USP
Terre Haute, diagnosed bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would
recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that the hernias be surgically repaired.
Since that time Mr. L�pez has reported to medical staff that he has
increasing pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still
able to exercise vigorously, but he currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the
Bureau of Prisons to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We have consulted with physicians who inform us that although the hernias
seem to be reducible, with the increasing pain, one of the two hernias might
become stuck, which could result in a surgical emergency.

Oscar, serving a 70 year sentence, is not eligible for release until 2027.
For more than half of his 22 years in prison, he was held in the most
maximum security prisons in the United States in the strictest solitary
confinement, politically punitive conditions calculated to break his will.
Withholding needed medical care is another weapon in the government�s
arsenal to seek this same end.

Prison officials at the maximum security United States Penitentiary at Terre
Haute, Indiana, where he is held, seem to be using his high security status
to delay needed medical treatment, at no small cost and risk to Oscar�s
health and well-being. We have written in protest to the Harley G. Lappin,
director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and we are calling on all people
of conscience to join in a letter writing campaign to insist that Oscar be
immediately provided with the medical care their own doctors have determined
he needs.

Re: Oscar L�pez Rivera, 87651-024

USP Terre Haute

Dear Director Lappin:
In March of 2003, a surgeon at USP Terre Haute, Dr. Taude, diagnosed Mr.
L�pez with bilateral hernias. The doctor indicated he would recommend to the
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) that the hernias be surgically repaired. Since that
time, Mr. L�pez has reported to the medical staff that he has increasing
pain in the area of the hernias. Three months ago he was still able to
exercise vigorously, but he is currently unable to do so because of the
pain. After enduring months of pain and discomfort since the diagnosis, Mr.
L�pez again saw Dr. Taude in early October. The doctor assured Mr. L�pez
that he had recommended surgery, but apprised him that it was up to the BOP
to decided whether to provide the surgery.

We are concerned, based on his attorney's consultation with qualified
outside medical personnel, that although the hernias seem to be reducible,
the pain is increasing, and if one of the hernias becomes stuck, the result
could be a surgical emergency. We further understand that since he has two
hernias, they could both be repaired at the same time so that he will have
to recover from only one surgery, and avoiding the necessity for anesthesia
on two occasions.

Finally, given the political nature of the acts and beliefs for which Mr.
L�pez is in prison-fighting for the independence of Puerto Rico- we are
concerned that prison authorities are placing an inappropriate emphasis on
his high security status, at no small cost and risk to Mr. L�pez' 
health and
well-being. We insist that you immediately provide him with the care that
the surgeon has already determined he needs. You can be sure that we will
continue to monitor his situation and advocate for his human rights. We
expect a forthcoming response.

Sincerely yours,

Background Information on Oscar L�pez Rivera and the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners.
Oscar L�pez Rivera was among fifteen Puerto Rican men and women imprisoned
in the 1980's and 1990's for their acts and beliefs in favor of 
Puerto Rican
independence. The support for their release included several members of
congress, Nobel laureates, labor leaders, the Catholic Archbishop of Puerto
Rico, and all the major Protestant churches of Puerto Rico and many
denominations in the US, as well as the entire political spectrum in Puerto
Rico.

By the time most of these supporters became involved in the campaign for
their release, the prisoners had all served over a decade in prison. The
supporters held many different views about pacifism vs. just war and
political status, but they agreed that that these prisoners had received
disproportionately long sentences (ave. over 65 years) and had more than
served whatever debt they may have owed to society.

Of those fifteen, in 1999 President Clinton commuted the sentences of
eleven, declaring that their sentences were indeed disproportionate. Of the
four who remain in prison, two are scheduled for release before the end of
next year. Mr. L�pez and Carlos Alberto Torres, however, continue to face
the equivalent of life sentences, with release dates in 2027 and 2024,
respectively.

Most of these political prisoners, including Mr. L�pez and Mr. Torres, were
associated with the FALN (Armed Forces of National Liberation) and were
convicted of seditious conspiracy (the same charge for which Nelson Mandela
was convicted, and which has been used primarily against the Puerto Rican
independence movement). They were accused of military actions against
corporate and military targets related to the colonial condition of Puerto
Rico, but not of any act resulting in human injury or loss of life. Because
they invoked the international law position as prisoners of war, insisting
that they had a right under the Geneva Conventions to be tried by an
international tribunal instead of by the colonial power, they did not defend
themselves in court.

Just as their disproportionate sentences were calculated to punish them for
their political beliefs and acts, so have their prison conditions,
particularly in Mr. L�pez� case. For over 12 years he experienced the most
maximum security prisons in the U.S., including USP Marion, Illinois,
condemned by Amnesty International as violating virtually every one of the
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and
ADX Florence, Colorado, the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," known for interning
those regarded by the government as "terrorists."

Since September 11, the risk to those who remain in prison has only
increased, as the "anti-terrorist" order of the day has ushered in a harsher
regime, making their segregation and isolation even more imminent, and
elevating their high security status to the point where it interferes with
needed medical care.

While those of us who sought the release of all fifteen celebrate that
eleven have come home, we continue to strive for the heath, welfare and
freedom of those who remain behind bars.

We are relieved to inform you that on December 16, 2003, the Bureau of

hernias. Without your intervention, they would undoubtedly have prolonged
his suffering. From Terre Haute, Oscar sends his thanks to all of those who
sent letters urging the prison to repair his hernia.

While we should celebrate this accomplishment, we must keep in mind that the
second hernia still needs surgical repair. After Oscar has recuperated, and
after he has been evaluated for the other hernia, we will evaluate the
situation. Should another campaign be necessary, we know we can count on
you. Thanks so much for your support!

18 December, 2003    Report from the Peace and Justice Camp

Jos� Monta�ez Sanes to be sentenced today

Today at 9AM in the courtroom of Judge Fust� in the Federal Court in San
Juan, sentencing will take place againt Jos� Monta�ez Sanes.  Jos� is the
nephew of David Sanes (R.I.P.), the Viequense security guard killed when a
US pilot dropped two, five hundred pound live bombs on the military
observation post where Sanes was working on 19 April, 1999.  This death,
direct result of US Navy bombing carried out for over sixty years in
Vieques, shook the consciousness of the Vieques/Puerto Rican people and
initiated four years of intense peacefull civil disobedience that succeeded
in stopping the bombing and getting the Navy out of Vieques.

Jos�'s family - and in particular, his mother, Myrta - has suffered
immensely from the tragedy of the military presence on Vieques.  The death
of David and, one year later of his mother, Epifania, the arrest of Myrta in
civil disobedience and now the arrest and sentencing of Jos�, is
representative of the consequences of militarism for our people.

Today's sentencing responds to the arrest of Jos� as part of the 12 accused
for incidents here last May first, during celebrations for the official
closing of US Navy activity here.  Despite work of an excellent legal team
and negotiations with federal officials, Jos� faces a 20 month jail
sentence.  We hope that God and the Puerto Rican blood that runs through the
veins of this federal judge, can convince Fust� to act with justice and end
the practice of punishment and the role of 'henchman' at the service of the
Navy which has been the history of the Federal Court in Puerto Rico.

On May 1st, 2003, the Puerto Rican people won a decisive victory against the
U.S. Navy and the U.S. government.  After decades of struggle, organizing,
civil disobedience and solidarity work, the people of Vieques forced the
U.S. Navy to cease using the Eastern portion of Vieques as their bombing
range.

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the
U.S. Navy from Vieques.  Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest.  It is also an
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the
four demands of the People of Vieques
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

Jos� P�rez Gonzalez (#21519-069) and Jos� V�lez Acosta (#23883-069) are in
the Federal Prison in Puerto Rico in relation to actions on Vieques last May
first.

Five of those arrested for the incidents of May 1st in Vieques during the
celebration over the Navy's departure, were senteced today by Judge Jos� A.
Fust� of the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico. All five had pled guily on
advice of their counsel.

The sentences were as follows:

Nilda Medina, of the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques,
was sentenced to one year on probation, 200 hours of community work, and was
fined $2,000;

Jes�s Delgado, former president of the Teachers' Federation, was sentenced
to 24 months on probation, nine of which he'll have to serve under house
arrest, and was fined $3,000;

N�stor de Jes�s Guishard, a young Vieques activist, was sentenced to eight
months in prison and a year on probation;

Heriberto Hern�ndez was sentenced to four months in prison, two years on
conditional release, and was fined $3,000;

Manuel P�rez Santiago was sentenced to 12 months on probation and fined
$3,000.

Jose Perez Gonzalez was sentenced to FIVE YEARS in jail and two years
probation.

Let Us Welcome Compa�ero Juan Segarra Palmer!
By Jorge Farinacci Garc�a

Compa�ero Juan E. Segarra Palmer (Papo) will be leaving a Federal Prison in 
the State of Florida this coming January 23, 2004, after having been 
imprisoned for nearly 19 years.  This pro-independence fighter was arrested 
during a huge repressive operation which was carried out in Puerto Rico by 
U.S. armed agents on August 30, 1985, with the alleged objective of dealing 
a crippling blow to the pro-independence organization PRTP-EPB (Macheteros).

All those who struggle in our  homeland for a better future for our people, 
for a free, just and democratic future, has a great debt with brothers and 
sisters such as Juan Segarra who have dedicated their lives in the struggle 
for our cause and have suffered the brunt of the fury of U.S. imperialism.  
The government of the United States alleged that Compa�ero Segarra was one 
of the main leaders of the revolutionary organization The Macheteros and 
alleged further that he led the operation that expropriated the deposits of 
the Wells Fargo Company in Hartford, Connecticut.   This operation which was 
carried out by the Macheteros resulted in more than 7 million dollars 
getting into the hands of the revolutionary movement with the goal of 
advancing the anti-colonial and independence cause in Puerto Rico, as was 
recognized by the U.S. Department of Justice.  It is important to note that 
representatives of the U.S. Justice Department were forced to admit that all 
that money was utilized for the purposes just mentioned and that no one 
utilized these funds for personal gain.

For all the people of Puerto Rico, for the friends, family members and 
comrades in struggle of Papo Segarra and for all those men and women that 
today continue to hold high the banners of justice and freedom, it is a 
great source of pride to have the privilege of being able to welcome this 
Compa�ero who has given his all for our cause.

Upon this Compa�ero�s return to Puerto Rico during the weekend of January 
24-25, 2004, pro-independence fighters of all political stripes and 
ideological tendencies, including socialists, nationalists, Christians and 
others, will be united in the jubilation and joy that is embodied in being 
able to welcome to his homeland this hero of our cause.   We do so in the 
same manner in which we have welcomed home other heroes and sheroes that 
have returned to Puerto Rico from the jails of the empire and whose return 
has been a result of our peoples continued and unceasing struggle for the 
freedom of each and everyone of them.

During these unitary and well deserved welcoming activities all 
pro-independence organizations will participate including, the Socialist 
Front and its member organizations such as The Workshop for Political 
Formation (TFP), The Socialist Movement of Workers (MST), The Revolutionary 
Party of Puerto Rican Workers (PRTP), Communist Refoundation (RC), Union of 
Socialist Youth (UJS) and the Revolutionary Youth League (LJR).  In addition 
other organizations such as The National Hostosiano Congress-New Puerto 
Rican Pro-Independence Movement(Congreso Nacional Hostosiano-Nuevo 
Movimiento Independentista Puertorrique�o), The Nationalist Party of Puerto 
Rico (Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico), The Puerto Rican Independence 
Party (Partido Independentista Puertorrique�o), The Resistance Collective 
(El Colectivo de Resistencia) and The Revolutionary Movement of the People 
(Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo).  Also participating actively will be 
the Committee for Human Rights (Comit� Pro Derechos Humanos) and 
organization active in the demands for the freedom of all our political 
prisoners.

I would like to highlight and make special mention of the participation of 
all the student and youth organizations such as the University Federation 
Pro Independence (Federaci�n Universitaria Pro Independencia), The 
Revolutionary Youth League (Liga Juvenil Revolucionaria) and the Union of 
Socialist Youth (Union de Juventudes Socialistas) who are making special 
efforts around these activities and taking on important tasks in the 
organization and development of the same.  We are conscious of the fact that 
none of these young people have had the opportunity to meet Compa�ero Papo 
Segarra personally but have clearly expressed their ardent desire to know a 
person that has contributed so much so that today our movement  continues to 
be such a vibrant political force in Puerto Rico.

All of these organizations along with Papo�s friends and family have come 
together in the �Welcoming Committee for Juan Segarra Palmer�.  We have 
assumed the task of making the welcoming event for the Compa�ero one which 
is characterized by its vibrancy, by its high level of human warmth and 
profound patriotic fervor.  Present in this peoples� welcome in spirit will 
be his mother and father who struggled for his freedom but passed away 
before actually seeing him free.
The Welcoming Committee will shortly be making public the details of the 
welcoming, including the exact time and day of his return and the 
participation of religious, labor and trade union sectors who have become a 
part of this activity.

Today, we make a call to everyone so that none may miss this opportunity and 
privilege to participate in an event of this importance for our struggle.  
We call upon everyone to join us at the Airport in Carolina on the day of 
the return to his people of Compa�ero Juan E. Segarra Palmer.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is happy to annouce the following update on
Oscar Lopez Rivera:

December 18, 2003

We are relieved to inform you that on December 16, 2003, the Bureau of
Prisons responded to your letters by operating on one of Oscar L�pez�
hernias. Without your intervention, they would undoubtedly have prolonged
his suffering. From Terre Haute, Oscar sends his thanks to all of those who
sent letters urging the prison to repair his hernia.

While we should celebrate this accomplishment, we must keep in mind that the
second hernia still needs surgical repair. After Oscar has recuperated, and
after he has been evaluated for the other hernia, we will evaluate the
situation. Should another campaign be necessary, we know we can count on
you. Thanks so much for your support!

18 December, 2003    Report from the Peace and Justice Camp

Jos� Monta�ez Sanes to be sentenced today

Today at 9AM in the courtroom of Judge Fust� in the Federal Court in San
Juan, sentencing will take place againt Jos� Monta�ez Sanes.  Jos� is the
nephew of David Sanes (R.I.P.), the Viequense security guard killed when a
US pilot dropped two, five hundred pound live bombs on the military
observation post where Sanes was working on 19 April, 1999.  This death,
direct result of US Navy bombing carried out for over sixty years in
Vieques, shook the consciousness of the Vieques/Puerto Rican people and
initiated four years of intense peacefull civil disobedience that succeeded
in stopping the bombing and getting the Navy out of Vieques.

Jos�'s family - and in particular, his mother, Myrta - has suffered
immensely from the tragedy of the military presence on Vieques.  The death
of David and, one year later of his mother, Epifania, the arrest of Myrta in
civil disobedience and now the arrest and sentencing of Jos�, is
representative of the consequences of militarism for our people.

Today's sentencing responds to the arrest of Jos� as part of the 12 accused
for incidents here last May first, during celebrations for the official
closing of US Navy activity here.  Despite work of an excellent legal team
and negotiations with federal officials, Jos� faces a 20 month jail
sentence.  We hope that God and the Puerto Rican blood that runs through the
veins of this federal judge, can convince Fust� to act with justice and end
the practice of punishment and the role of 'henchman' at the service of the
Navy which has been the history of the Federal Court in Puerto Rico.

On May 1st, 2003, the Puerto Rican people won a decisive victory against the
U.S. Navy and the U.S. government.  After decades of struggle, organizing,
civil disobedience and solidarity work, the people of Vieques forced the
U.S. Navy to cease using the Eastern portion of Vieques as their bombing
range.

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the
U.S. Navy from Vieques.  Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest.  It is also an
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the
four demands of the People of Vieques
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

Jos� P�rez Gonzalez (#21519-069) and Jos� V�lez Acosta (#23883-069) are in
the Federal Prison in Puerto Rico in relation to actions on Vieques last May
first.

Five of those arrested for the incidents of May 1st in Vieques during the
celebration over the Navy's departure, were senteced today by Judge Jos� A.
Fust� of the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico. All five had pled guily on
advice of their counsel.

The sentences were as follows:

Nilda Medina, of the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques,
was sentenced to one year on probation, 200 hours of community work, and was
fined $2,000;

Jes�s Delgado, former president of the Teachers' Federation, was sentenced
to 24 months on probation, nine of which he'll have to serve under house
arrest, and was fined $3,000;

N�stor de Jes�s Guishard, a young Vieques activist, was sentenced to eight
months in prison and a year on probation;

Heriberto Hern�ndez was sentenced to four months in prison, two years on
conditional release, and was fined $3,000;

Manuel P�rez Santiago was sentenced to 12 months on probation and fined
$3,000.

Jose Perez Gonzalez was sentenced to FIVE YEARS in jail and two years
probation.

Let Us Welcome Compa�ero Juan Segarra Palmer!
By Jorge Farinacci Garc�a

Compa�ero Juan E. Segarra Palmer (Papo) will be leaving a Federal Prison in
the State of Florida this coming January 23, 2004, after having been
imprisoned for nearly 19 years.  This pro-independence fighter was arrested
during a huge repressive operation which was carried out in Puerto Rico by
U.S. armed agents on August 30, 1985, with the alleged objective of dealing
a crippling blow to the pro-independence organization PRTP-EPB (Macheteros).

All those who struggle in our  homeland for a better future for our people,
for a free, just and democratic future, has a great debt with brothers and
sisters such as Juan Segarra who have dedicated their lives in the struggle
for our cause and have suffered the brunt of the fury of U.S. imperialism.
The government of the United States alleged that Compa�ero Segarra was one
of the main leaders of the revolutionary organization The Macheteros and
alleged further that he led the operation that expropriated the deposits of
the Wells Fargo Company in Hartford, Connecticut.   This operation which was
carried out by the Macheteros resulted in more than 7 million dollars
getting into the hands of the revolutionary movement with the goal of
advancing the anti-colonial and independence cause in Puerto Rico, as was
recognized by the U.S. Department of Justice.  It is important to note that
representatives of the U.S. Justice Department were forced to admit that all
that money was utilized for the purposes just mentioned and that no one
utilized these funds for personal gain.

For all the people of Puerto Rico, for the friends, family members and
comrades in struggle of Papo Segarra and for all those men and women that
today continue to hold high the banners of justice and freedom, it is a
great source of pride to have the privilege of being able to welcome this
Compa�ero who has given his all for our cause.

Upon this Compa�ero�s return to Puerto Rico during the weekend of January
24-25, 2004, pro-independence fighters of all political stripes and
ideological tendencies, including socialists, nationalists, Christians and
others, will be united in the jubilation and joy that is embodied in being
able to welcome to his homeland this hero of our cause.   We do so in the
same manner in which we have welcomed home other heroes and sheroes that
have returned to Puerto Rico from the jails of the empire and whose return
has been a result of our peoples continued and unceasing struggle for the
freedom of each and everyone of them.

During these unitary and well deserved welcoming activities all
pro-independence organizations will participate including, the Socialist
Front and its member organizations such as The Workshop for Political
Formation (TFP), The Socialist Movement of Workers (MST), The Revolutionary
Party of Puerto Rican Workers (PRTP), Communist Refoundation (RC), Union of
Socialist Youth (UJS) and the Revolutionary Youth League (LJR).  In addition
other organizations such as The National Hostosiano Congress-New Puerto
Rican Pro-Independence Movement(Congreso Nacional Hostosiano-Nuevo
Movimiento Independentista Puertorrique�o), The Nationalist Party of Puerto
Rico (Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico), The Puerto Rican Independence
Party (Partido Independentista Puertorrique�o), The Resistance Collective
(El Colectivo de Resistencia) and The Revolutionary Movement of the People
(Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo).  Also participating actively will be
the Committee for Human Rights (Comit� Pro Derechos Humanos) and
organization active in the demands for the freedom of all our political
prisoners.

I would like to highlight and make special mention of the participation of
all the student and youth organizations such as the University Federation
Pro Independence (Federaci�n Universitaria Pro Independencia), The
Revolutionary Youth League (Liga Juvenil Revolucionaria) and the Union of
Socialist Youth (Union de Juventudes Socialistas) who are making special
efforts around these activities and taking on important tasks in the
organization and development of the same.  We are conscious of the fact that
none of these young people have had the opportunity to meet Compa�ero Papo
Segarra personally but have clearly expressed their ardent desire to know a
person that has contributed so much so that today our movement  continues to
be such a vibrant political force in Puerto Rico.

All of these organizations along with Papo�s friends and family have come
together in the �Welcoming Committee for Juan Segarra Palmer�.  We have
assumed the task of making the welcoming event for the Compa�ero one which
is characterized by its vibrancy, by its high level of human warmth and
profound patriotic fervor.  Present in this peoples� welcome in spirit will
be his mother and father who struggled for his freedom but passed away
before actually seeing him free.
The Welcoming Committee will shortly be making public the details of the
welcoming, including the exact time and day of his return and the
participation of religious, labor and trade union sectors who have become a
part of this activity.

Today, we make a call to everyone so that none may miss this opportunity and
privilege to participate in an event of this importance for our struggle.
We call upon everyone to join us at the Airport in Carolina on the day of
the return to his people of Compa�ero Juan E. Segarra Palmer.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is happy to annouce the following update on
Oscar Lopez Rivera:

December 18, 2003

We are relieved to inform you that on December 16, 2003, the Bureau of
Prisons responded to your letters by operating on one of Oscar L�pez�
hernias. Without your intervention, they would undoubtedly have prolonged
his suffering. From Terre Haute, Oscar sends his thanks to all of those who
sent letters urging the prison to repair his hernia.

While we should celebrate this accomplishment, we must keep in mind that the
second hernia still needs surgical repair. After Oscar has recuperated, and
after he has been evaluated for the other hernia, we will evaluate the
situation. Should another campaign be necessary, we know we can count on
you. Thanks so much for your support!

18 December, 2003    Report from the Peace and Justice Camp

Jos� Monta�ez Sanes to be sentenced today

Today at 9AM in the courtroom of Judge Fust� in the Federal Court in San
Juan, sentencing will take place againt Jos� Monta�ez Sanes.  Jos� is the
nephew of David Sanes (R.I.P.), the Viequense security guard killed when a
US pilot dropped two, five hundred pound live bombs on the military
observation post where Sanes was working on 19 April, 1999.  This death,
direct result of US Navy bombing carried out for over sixty years in
Vieques, shook the consciousness of the Vieques/Puerto Rican people and
initiated four years of intense peacefull civil disobedience that succeeded
in stopping the bombing and getting the Navy out of Vieques.

Jos�'s family - and in particular, his mother, Myrta - has suffered
immensely from the tragedy of the military presence on Vieques.  The death
of David and, one year later of his mother, Epifania, the arrest of Myrta in
civil disobedience and now the arrest and sentencing of Jos�, is
representative of the consequences of militarism for our people.

Today's sentencing responds to the arrest of Jos� as part of the 12 accused
for incidents here last May first, during celebrations for the official
closing of US Navy activity here.  Despite work of an excellent legal team
and negotiations with federal officials, Jos� faces a 20 month jail
sentence.  We hope that God and the Puerto Rican blood that runs through the
veins of this federal judge, can convince Fust� to act with justice and end
the practice of punishment and the role of 'henchman' at the service of the
Navy which has been the history of the Federal Court in Puerto Rico.

On May 1st, 2003, the Puerto Rican people won a decisive victory against the
U.S. Navy and the U.S. government.  After decades of struggle, organizing,
civil disobedience and solidarity work, the people of Vieques forced the
U.S. Navy to cease using the Eastern portion of Vieques as their bombing
range.

The Vieques 12 are activists, community members and residents of
Vieques/mainland Puerto Rico that have been targeted by the FBI for their
activities in Vieques on May 1st, 2003. The arrests of ten of the Vieques 12
in June is another attempt by the FBI and U.S. government to repress and
punish Vieques activists for participating in the struggle to remove the
U.S. Navy from Vieques.  Two of the twelve, Jose Perez went to trial in
Sept. and Jose Velez turned himself in after the arrest.  It is also an
attempt to discourage activists from continuing the struggle to achieve the
four demands of the People of Vieques
(Decontamination-Devolution-Development-Demilitarization)!!

Jos� P�rez Gonzalez (#21519-069) and Jos� V�lez Acosta (#23883-069) are in
the Federal Prison in Puerto Rico in relation to actions on Vieques last May
first.

Five of those arrested for the incidents of May 1st in Vieques during the
celebration over the Navy's departure, were senteced today by Judge Jos� A.
Fust� of the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico. All five had pled guily on
advice of their counsel.

The sentences were as follows:

Nilda Medina, of the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques,
was sentenced to one year on probation, 200 hours of community work, and was
fined $2,000;

Jes�s Delgado, former president of the Teachers' Federation, was sentenced
to 24 months on probation, nine of which he'll have to serve under house
arrest, and was fined $3,000;

N�stor de Jes�s Guishard, a young Vieques activist, was sentenced to eight
months in prison and a year on probation;

Heriberto Hern�ndez was sentenced to four months in prison, two years on
conditional release, and was fined $3,000;

Manuel P�rez Santiago was sentenced to 12 months on probation and fined
$3,000.

Jose Perez Gonzalez was sentenced to FIVE YEARS in jail and two years
probation.
