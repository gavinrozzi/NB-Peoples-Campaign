HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND HAPPY THREE KINGS!!

Oscar Lopez Rivera
#87651-024
U.S. Penitentiary
P.O. Box 12015
Terre Haute, IN 47801

Oscar Lopez Rivera was born in San Sebastian, Puerto Rico on January 6,
1943. At the age of 12, he moved to Chicago with his family. He was a
well-respected community activist and a prominent independence leader for
many years prior to his arrest. Oscar was one of the founders of the Rafael
Cancel Miranda High School, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High
School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was a
community organizer for the Northwest Community Organization (NCO), ASSPA,
ASPIRA and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found
FREE, (a half-way house for convicted drug addicts) and ALAS (an educational
program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois).

He was active in various community struggles, mainly in the area of health
care, employment and police brutality. He also participated in the
development of the Committee to Free the Five Puerto Rican Nationalists. In
1975, he was forced underground, along with other comrades. He was captured
on May 29, 1981, after 5 years of being persecuted by the FBI as one of the
most feared fugitives from US "justice".

Oscar, who has a daughter named Clarissa, is currently serving a 55-year
sentence for seditious conspiracy and other charges. He was convicted of
conspiracy to escape along with Jaime Delgado, (a veteran independence
leader), Dora Garcia, (a prominent community activist) and Kojo
Bomani-Sababu, a New Afrikan political prisoner.

Oscar was one of 12 Puerto Rican political prisoners offered some form of
leniency by the Clinton Administration in the fall of 1999. According to the
Chicago Sun Times, he "declined the president's offer, which still would
have him left with 10 years to serve on conspiracy to escape charges. Now he
faces at least 20 more years in prison. His sister, Zenaida Lopez, said he
turned the offer down because he would be on parole. 'Accepting what they
are offering him is like prison outside of prison,' she said. Zenaida Lopez
said her brother 'was in total agreement' with the decision of the 11 others
to take the conditional clemency." Oscar is presently in prison in Terre
Haute, Indiana and his release date is 7/27/2027.

Vieques Political Prisoner Jose Velez Acosta is scheduled to be released on
Jan. 27th, 2006 from prison.  We encourage people to write to Jose as well

Basque Society Moves for Prisoners' Rights

On Saturday, Nov. 26 2005, representatives of 29 Basque political, trade 
union, and social organizations met at the Ibaeta University Campus in 
Donostia in order to address the issue of Basque Political Prisoners.

They agreed on a document denouncing the consequences of the policy of 
prisoner dispersal and demanding the Spanish and French governments 
recognize the representatives of the political prisoners and engage with 
them so that the Basque Political Prisoners Collective (EPPK) may take part 
in the ongoing political process. They agree that supporting the prisoners' 
rights is an essential step towards conflict resolution. The manifesto will 
be put to public institutions as a motion.

They also made a joint call to demonstrate on Jan. 7, 2006 in Bilbo, under 
the banner of "Euskal Presoak Euskal Herrira, Dagozkien Eskubideen Jabe" 
(Bring the Basque Prisoners to the Basque Country, Acknowledge Their Rights)

On behalf of the Basque Pro-Amnesty movement and the organizations at the 
Ibaeta Forum, we ask that, together with the broad representation of Basque 
society, you support the demonstration.

2006: Together We Can Tear Down The Walls
by Benjamin Ramos, The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign

Every year, it�s my task to write a piece for El Coqui Libre that 
encapsulates the work that the campaign did in the previous year, in hopes 
that our readership will be so impressed and inspired by our work that they 
will drop everything they�re doing, contact us and start working with our 
campaign. So far, this approach has not worked.

Albert Einstein once defined insanity as, �doing the same thing over and 
over again and expecting different results.� This year, I am not going to 
bother to list our accomplishments, speaking engagements and all the other 
assorted activities we were a part of in the year 2005. This year, I am 
going to be frank with our readership, maybe the honest approach will change 
matters.

We need you!! Plain and simple!! The movement to free our political 
prisoners is extremely small and is barely a part of the independentista 
agenda. Our movement is not growing, is not evolving and desperately needs 
revitalization. That is the truth; it hurts to admit it and write it, but 
that is what it is and once once we all accept this harsh truth, then maybe 
we can move towards resolution and change.

In the 11 years we have existed, ProLibertad has done amazing work. We, the 
few, proud and brave, have done everything we can to bring this issue to 
everyone and anyone. We have had some incredible successes and some 
failures; along the way we have jumped over hurdles and pioneered a method 
of work that others are still emulating.

We have tried to adapt our strategies and tactics to the changing world 
around us; we have tried to stay current and on top of pertinent political 
issues,. We have done our best to inspire and educate. Why is this not 
enough? What are we missing? Why aren�t you working with us? What the hell 
is the problem?

Yes, I am frustrated!! I am the classic academic overachiever who cannot 
deal with not knowing the answer!! I hate to ask this, but could you tell me 
the answer? Could you let me know what it is that we are doing that is not 
working? I have wracked my brains on this issue; I keep trying to solve 
these questions myself and it isn�t working.

I have confronted people, in a non-confrontation manner of course, about 
this issue and have asked what they think. I have heard everything from, 
�The Prisoners aren�t an issue any more since 1999!!� to, �Political 
Prisoner work is not important to people, because it has nothing to do with 
their lives.� I have even heard some folks say, �The Political prisoner 
movement is full of old people and youth don�t feel they have a space��

Do these statements represent the majority opinion? I hope not!!

The Presidential Clemency of 1999 was an amazing peoples� victory, but check 
out the back of this newsletter, there are still people in jail for fighting 
for self-determination and independence. The work is not over. The fact that 
some of the prisoners did not accept the clemency offer or were not offered 
it at all doesn�t mean that they will never be freed. Come on folks!! Why do 
we walk away from a great partial victory as though there is nothing left to 
do?

This work is effective when the people involved are patient, consistent and 
resilient. It took 25 years to free Lolita Lebron, Rafael Cancel Miranda, 
Andres Figuerora Cordero, Oscar Collazo and Irving Flores (the five 
Nationalists)!! No, this work isn�t about protesting and chanting all day!! 
No, it isn�t about constant press junkets, cameras flashing and movie stars; 
it is about maneuvering through all different areas of society. One minute 
we are speaking over a bullhorn at a picket, the next we are meeting with a 
Council person, the next we are in a classroom or at the United Nations.

Now, I would like to address the statement about how the existence of 
political prisoners has nothing to do with peoples� lives. If you simply 
take a superficial look at his issue, sure it has nothing to do with �real� 
life. Minimum wage is the same, people are still struggling and youth are 
still being railroaded from school the military industrial complex. It�s 
true, fighting to free these people isn�t going to feed the hungry or house 
the homeless. Or does it? If you take the time out to look at the bigger 
picture of this work, then the view changes.

The Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, as with many other Political 
Prisoners, were incarcerated because they were a threat to the U.S. colonial 
status quo. They fought for self-termination and independence against a 
country that imposed itself on Puerto Rico. Under International law, the 
prisoners� actions were justified. The U.S. refuses to recognize anyone who 
calls themselves a political prisoner, because the U.S. has never 
incarcerated anyone for having a different political perspectives than the 
norm. We all know this to be false.

In the past few decades this country has not only violated the civil and 
human rights of its citizenry, but has.. incarcerated, primarily through 
false pretenses, people who fight for justice and freedom. Interesting 
right? Especially, since this country was founded by people demanding an end 
to repression.

Once we get people to realize that the minute one of us loses our civil and 
human rights, it is an attack on all of us; the better off we all will be. 
When people realize that you are allowed to be �free�, as long as you don�t 
have a �dissident opinion.�, then maybe those people will see that this work 
won�t increase your hourly wage, but it will protect you and support you 
when you get out there to protest that same cheap hourly wage and are 
arrested.

This work uncovers and puts under a spot light the abuses this so-called, 
�democracy� has done against its citizenry. This work proves the belief that 
we live in a free society is false and hypocritical. The freedom of our 
political prisoners will allow to further expose this country for lying, 
cheating and imperialist monster it is. The minute we get people thinking 
that all of this has to change, then we have the foundation of a mass 
movement.

�The Political prisoner movement is full of old people and youth don�t feel 
they have a space�� As a young person, I have felt that way in the past. In 
an ideal world, all of us would naturally create a multi-generational 
movement that works together and is all inclusive. Well, that doesn�t exist 
and won�t, until you get involved! I came into this work with few skills and 
some basic political formation, and I thought there was no niche for me. So 
I carved it out. I chose to carve it out within the campaign; I could have 
easily decided to create a youth campaign or just left the work entirely, 
but it was too important to me. If you see that in ProLibertad, then join us 
and change it. Our prisoners need us active and organizing, not sitting at 
home watching MTV and playing XBOX complaining , �I don�t feel included!!�

Come on!! The youth organizing history of this country has taught us many 
lessons. One of them is that young people have always been a part of this 
work, because they made themselves a part of it. No one opened any doors, 
most of the time they knocked the doors down and walked into the work. 
Please feel free to knock down some of the doors folks, because we need you.

Look mi gente, I am getting tired and I think I have rambled... enough for 
the small pace allocated for this piece. I want to encourage people to 
dialogue and debate. As ProLibertad�s resident webmaster, I am going to 
bring this issue to the people via our web blog so that I can hear from you. 
I need you changes.

The Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, as with many other Political 
Prisoners, were incarcerated because they were a threat to the U.S. colonial 
status quo. They fought for self-termination and independence against a 
country that imposed itself on Puerto Rico. Under International law, the 
prisoners� actions were justified. The U.S. refuses to recognize anyone who 
calls themselves a political prisoner, because the U.S. has never 
incarcerated anyone for having a different political perspectives than the 
norm. We all know this to be false.

I need you to read this article and answer some of my questions, give your 
opinion on this piece, and share your thoughts on what we can do to change 
and improve this movement.

The title of this piece is, �2006: Together we can Tear down the walls.� I 
need you all to take this seriously. If we can start communicating, then 
maybe we can tear down the feelings of alienation some might feel, we could 
tear down the political differences and maybe start building the mass 
movement we need for our prisoners and Puerto Rico.

I have faith in us; our history has shown us to be a powerful liberating 
force. We have accomplished amazing things, but that has only happened when 
people have united and worked together. It all starts with talking and, 
nowadays, emailing.

I don�t know what is keeping us a part, so tell me. Be brave about yours and 
bring it out to the table. We need this folks. We have five people in jail 
and they desperately need us to continue on for them while they are away. 
Start the dialogue and begin the revolution from within. Be the change you 
want to see.

I am out of inspiring words to write!! Just let me know what you think!!

2006: Together We Can Tear Down The Walls
by Benjamin Ramos, The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign

Every year, it�s my task to write a piece for El Coqui Libre that
encapsulates the work that the campaign did in the previous year, in hopes
that our readership will be so impressed and inspired by our work that they
will drop everything they�re doing, contact us and start working with our
campaign. So far, this approach has not worked.

Albert Einstein once defined insanity as, �doing the same thing over and
over again and expecting different results.� This year, I am not going to
bother to list our accomplishments, speaking engagements and all the other
assorted activities we were a part of in the year 2005. This year, I am
going to be frank with our readership, maybe the honest approach will change
matters.

We need you!! Plain and simple!! The movement to free our political
prisoners is extremely small and is barely a part of the independentista
agenda. Our movement is not growing, is not evolving and desperately needs
revitalization. That is the truth; it hurts to admit it and write it, but
that is what it is and once once we all accept this harsh truth, then maybe
we can move towards resolution and change.

In the 11 years we have existed, ProLibertad has done amazing work. We, the
few, proud and brave, have done everything we can to bring this issue to
everyone and anyone. We have had some incredible successes and some
failures; along the way we have jumped over hurdles and pioneered a method
of work that others are still emulating.

We have tried to adapt our strategies and tactics to the changing world
around us; we have tried to stay current and on top of pertinent political
issues,. We have done our best to inspire and educate. Why is this not
enough? What are we missing? Why aren�t you working with us? What the hell
is the problem?

Yes, I am frustrated!! I am the classic academic overachiever who cannot
deal with not knowing the answer!! I hate to ask this, but could you tell me
the answer? Could you let me know what it is that we are doing that is not
working? I have wracked my brains on this issue; I keep trying to solve
these questions myself and it isn�t working.

I have confronted people, in a non-confrontation manner of course, about
this issue and have asked what they think. I have heard everything from,
�The Prisoners aren�t an issue any more since 1999!!� to, �Political
Prisoner work is not important to people, because it has nothing to do with
their lives.� I have even heard some folks say, �The Political prisoner
movement is full of old people and youth don�t feel they have a space��

Do these statements represent the majority opinion? I hope not!!

The Presidential Clemency of 1999 was an amazing peoples� victory, but check
out the back of this newsletter, there are still people in jail for fighting
for self-determination and independence. The work is not over. The fact that
some of the prisoners did not accept the clemency offer or were not offered
it at all doesn�t mean that they will never be freed. Come on folks!! Why do
we walk away from a great partial victory as though there is nothing left to
do?

This work is effective when the people involved are patient, consistent and
resilient. It took 25 years to free Lolita Lebron, Rafael Cancel Miranda,
Andres Figuerora Cordero, Oscar Collazo and Irving Flores (the five
Nationalists)!! No, this work isn�t about protesting and chanting all day!!
No, it isn�t about constant press junkets, cameras flashing and movie stars;
it is about maneuvering through all different areas of society. One minute
we are speaking over a bullhorn at a picket, the next we are meeting with a
Council person, the next we are in a classroom or at the United Nations.

Now, I would like to address the statement about how the existence of
political prisoners has nothing to do with peoples� lives. If you simply
take a superficial look at his issue, sure it has nothing to do with �real�
life. Minimum wage is the same, people are still struggling and youth are
still being railroaded from school the military industrial complex. It�s
true, fighting to free these people isn�t going to feed the hungry or house
the homeless. Or does it? If you take the time out to look at the bigger
picture of this work, then the view changes.

The Puerto Rican Political Prisoners, as with many other Political
Prisoners, were incarcerated because they were a threat to the U.S. colonial
status quo. They fought for self-termination and independence against a
country that imposed itself on Puerto Rico. Under International law, the
prisoners� actions were justified. The U.S. refuses to recognize anyone who
calls themselves a political prisoner, because the U.S. has never
incarcerated anyone for having a different political perspectives than the
norm. We all know this to be false.

human rights of its citizenry, but has.. incarcerated, primarily through
false pretenses, people who fight for justice and freedom. Interesting
right? Especially, since this country was founded by people demanding an end
to repression.

Once we get people to realize that the minute one of us loses our civil and
human rights, it is an attack on all of us; the better off we all will be.
When people realize that you are allowed to be �free�, as long as you don�t
have a �dissident opinion.�, then maybe those people will see that this work
won�t increase your hourly wage, but it will protect you and support you
when you get out there to protest that same cheap hourly wage and are
arrested.

This work uncovers and puts under a spot light the abuses this so-called,
�democracy� has done against its citizenry. This work proves the belief that
we live in a free society is false and hypocritical. The freedom of our
political prisoners will allow to further expose this country for lying,
cheating and imperialist monster it is. The minute we get people thinking
that all of this has to change, then we have the foundation of a mass
movement.

movement that works together and is all inclusive. Well, that doesn�t exist

ASSATA SHAKUR, THE CUBAN 5 AND FILIBERTO OJEDA RIOS: State Repression and
Terrorism

Friday January 20th, 2006 at 7pm St. Mary�s Episcopal Church 521 W126th St.
(btwn. Amsterdam Ave. and Broadway)
Take the 1 or 9 train to W125th St. and Broadway

As the U.S. government continues its terrorist and repressive occupation of
Iraq, it has also waged a war against freedom fighters and revolutionaries
in the U.S.

In the past year, the U.S. government has increased the bounty on Assata
Shakur and added her name to the domestic terrorist list, has intervened in
the case of the Cuban 5 in order to undo the decision of the 11th Circuit
Court for a retrial, and masterminded the political assassination of Puerto
Rican revolutionary leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios!!

Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5, Hands off Assata
Coalition and the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign for a night of discussion and
dialogue about U.S. terrorism and repression in our communities.

Join the 37th Contingent of the Venceremos Brigade!!!
Applications now available for July 2-17, 2006, work brigade to Cuba!!

Now is your opportunity to join the Venceremos Brigade's travel challenge, 
to see Cuba, and to defend your constitutional right to travel.

Since 1969, over 8,000 Brigadistas have traveled to Cuba to see the Cuban 
revolution for themselves and to take a stand against the unjust and immoral 
U.S. policy towards our neighbor.

Over the years, Brigadistas have harvested sugar cane, citrus, and corn, 
built housing, painted and repaired buildings - working side by side with 
Cuban workers and students. At the same time, we meet with leaders of Cuba's 
federations, mass organizations,and with artists, teachers, social workers, 
and Cuban 'internationalists' (people who have served abroad, fighting 
apartheid in Southern Africa or fighting disease throughout the world) and 
many others. Our goal is to see and learn as much as possible and hear from 
as many voices as we can. It is truly a life-changing experience.

The Venceremos Brigade has never requested a license from the U.S. 
government to travel to Cuba. We believe it is our Constitutional right to 
travel where we please. While the vast majority of the U.S. public supports 
an end to the travel restrictions, the Bush Administration has increased 
harassment of Cuban travelers and has eliminated almost all possibilities 
for legal travel. In response, the VB has organized extremely successful 
public travel challenges since 2002.

Many Brigadistas have received letters from the Department of the Treasury 
demanding information and threatening fines. The government is reacting to 
our challenge and we will continue to fight legally and politically - and 
collectively - to resist these threats and to end the restrictions.

This is why we need more people than ever to participate in the 37th 
Contingent, our 4th annual Travel Challenge.

Here is your chance to be on the cutting edge of the movement to end the 
U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba and to see Revolutionary Cuba with your 
own eyes - If we don't stand up for our constitutional rights, who will?

This year we will be traveling to Cuba July 2-17, 2006, crossing the bridge 
into Buffalo, New York, on July 17th. The VB will visit both the eastern and 
western parts of the island, staying in a school near Santiago and in Havana 
province at our international work camp. All Venceremos Brigade travel 
challengers attend legal and other preparation sessions prior to the trip. 
Contact us for more information and an application.

THE MALCOLM X COMMEMORATION COMMITTEE
P.O. BOX 340084
JAMAICA, NEW YORK 11434

Malcolmites Host Annual
Political Prisoner Dinner Tribute

On Sunday, January 15th, the Malcolm X Commemoration Committee will host its 
annual dinner tribute to "the families of our political prisoners." This 
enormous tribute will take place at the Bed-Stuy Restoration Plaza, 1368 
Fulton Street, in Brooklyn.

The program is from 3-7p.m.

For more than ten years now, the Malcolm X Commemoration Committee (MXCC) 
has hosted this tribute in addition to its other work in defense of the 
revolutionary legacy of Malcolm X. The proceeds from the dinner go directly 
into the commissary account for each political prisoner who is represented 
by his family. The program focuses on freedom fighters who have family in 
this metropolitan area.

Sundiata Acoli, Herman Bell, The Move 9, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Bashir Hameed, 
Abdul-Majied, and Marshall
Eddie Conway , Russell Shoatz, Mutulu Shakur and Robert Seth Hayes have been 
proudly represented by their families at this annual event.

The Malcolm X Commemoration Committee has always insisted that Black 
political prisoners, all targets of the FBI CounterIntelligence Program, are 
the hidden legacy of Malcolm X. Just as important, there is also the untold 
story of how their wrongful incarceration has impacted on their families and 
their communities.

Even though many of our political prisoners are now going into their fourth 
decade of wrongful incarceration, they continue to hold firm to their 
beliefs in the righteousness of our struggle. Hence, this year's
theme is 'No Surrender! No Retreat!'

"Last year, we went to Albany to get our legislators to understand that it 
is way past time for them to move to get our freedom fighters out," 
explained an angry Herman Ferguson, Chairman for the MXCC and himself a 
former political prisoner. "This year, since they obviously haven't gotten 
the message, we will have to step up our campaign for parole reform and 
recognition of the status of political prisoners. We will move our efforts 
up another notch.

In addition to a sumptuous dinner. this year's event will feature guest 
presentations by Baba James Small,  Esperanza Martell and Dr. James 
McIntosh. Baba James Small was in the Organization of Afro-American Unity 
responsible for the security of Ella Little-Collins, Malcolm's powerful 
"big" sister. For nearly forty years now, in keeping with Sis. Ella's vision 
and initiative, he has organized and maintained the annual pilgrimage to 
Malcolm's gravesite. Esperanza Martell is one the chief players responsible 
for Pro-Libertad's successful amnesty campaign for eleven of Puerto Rico's 
political prisoners. Dr. James McIntosh, co-chair of CEMOTAP (the Committee 
to Eliminate Media Offensive To Afrikan People), has emerged as one of Black 
New York's premiere human rights voices.

Tickets for this special event are $35.00 and can be purchased in advance.

For more information, please call 718-949-5153.

Court for a retrial, and masterminded the political assassination of Puerto

Join the 37th Contingent of the Venceremos Brigade!!!
Applications now available for July 2-17, 2006, work brigade to Cuba!!

Now is your opportunity to join the Venceremos Brigade's travel challenge,
to see Cuba, and to defend your constitutional right to travel.

Since 1969, over 8,000 Brigadistas have traveled to Cuba to see the Cuban
revolution for themselves and to take a stand against the unjust and immoral
U.S. policy towards our neighbor.

Over the years, Brigadistas have harvested sugar cane, citrus, and corn,
built housing, painted and repaired buildings - working side by side with
Cuban workers and students. At the same time, we meet with leaders of Cuba's
federations, mass organizations,and with artists, teachers, social workers,
and Cuban 'internationalists' (people who have served abroad, fighting
apartheid in Southern Africa or fighting disease throughout the world) and
many others. Our goal is to see and learn as much as possible and hear from
as many voices as we can. It is truly a life-changing experience.

The Venceremos Brigade has never requested a license from the U.S.
government to travel to Cuba. We believe it is our Constitutional right to
travel where we please. While the vast majority of the U.S. public supports
an end to the travel restrictions, the Bush Administration has increased
harassment of Cuban travelers and has eliminated almost all possibilities
for legal travel. In response, the VB has organized extremely successful
public travel challenges since 2002.

Many Brigadistas have received letters from the Department of the Treasury
demanding information and threatening fines. The government is reacting to
our challenge and we will continue to fight legally and politically - and
collectively - to resist these threats and to end the restrictions.

This is why we need more people than ever to participate in the 37th
Contingent, our 4th annual Travel Challenge.

Here is your chance to be on the cutting edge of the movement to end the
U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba and to see Revolutionary Cuba with your
own eyes - If we don't stand up for our constitutional rights, who will?

This year we will be traveling to Cuba July 2-17, 2006, crossing the bridge
into Buffalo, New York, on July 17th. The VB will visit both the eastern and
western parts of the island, staying in a school near Santiago and in Havana
province at our international work camp. All Venceremos Brigade travel
challengers attend legal and other preparation sessions prior to the trip.
Contact us for more information and an application.

many others. Our goal is to see and learn as much as possible and hear from
as many voices as we can. It is truly a life-changing experience.

The Venceremos Brigade has never requested a license from the U.S.
government to travel to Cuba. We believe it is our Constitutional right to
travel where we please. While the vast majority of the U.S. public supports
an end to the travel restrictions, the Bush Administration has increased
harassment of Cuban travelers and has eliminated almost all possibilities
for legal travel. In response, the VB has organized extremely successful
public travel challenges since 2002.

Many Brigadistas have received letters from the Department of the Treasury
demanding information and threatening fines. The government is reacting to
our challenge and we will continue to fight legally and politically - and
collectively - to resist these threats and to end the restrictions.

This is why we need more people than ever to participate in the 37th
Contingent, our 4th annual Travel Challenge.

Here is your chance to be on the cutting edge of the movement to end the
U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba and to see Revolutionary Cuba with your
own eyes - If we don't stand up for our constitutional rights, who will?

This year we will be traveling to Cuba July 2-17, 2006, crossing the bridge
into Buffalo, New York, on July 17th. The VB will visit both the eastern and
western parts of the island, staying in a school near Santiago and in Havana
province at our international work camp. All Venceremos Brigade travel
challengers attend legal and other preparation sessions prior to the trip.

ASSATA SHAKUR, THE CUBAN 5 AND FILIBERTO OJEDA RIOS: State Repression and
Terrorism

Friday January 20th, 2006 at 7pm St. Mary's Episcopal Church 521 W126th St.
(btwn. Amsterdam Ave. and Broadway)
Take the 1 or 9 train to W125th St. and Broadway

As the U.S. government continues its terrorist and repressive occupation of
Iraq, it has also waged a war against freedom fighters and revolutionaries
in the U.S.

In the past year, the U.S. government has increased the bounty on Assata
Shakur and added her name to the domestic terrorist list, has intervened in
the case of the Cuban 5 in order to undo the decision of the 11th Circuit
Court for a retrial, and masterminded the political assassination of Puerto
Rican revolutionary leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios!!

Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5, Hands off Assata
Coalition and the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign for a night of discussion and
dialogue about U.S. terrorism and repression in our communities.

Join the 37th Contingent of the Venceremos Brigade!!!
Applications now available for July 2-17, 2006, work brigade to Cuba!!

Now is your opportunity to join the Venceremos Brigade's travel challenge,
to see Cuba, and to defend your constitutional right to travel.

Since 1969, over 8,000 Brigadistas have traveled to Cuba to see the Cuban
revolution for themselves and to take a stand against the unjust and immoral
U.S. policy towards our neighbor.

Over the years, Brigadistas have harvested sugar cane, citrus, and corn,
built housing, painted and repaired buildings - working side by side with
Cuban workers and students. At the same time, we meet with leaders of Cuba's
federations, mass organizations,and with artists, teachers, social workers,
and Cuban 'internationalists' (people who have served abroad, fighting
apartheid in Southern Africa or fighting disease throughout the world) and
many others. Our goal is to see and learn as much as possible and hear from
as many voices as we can. It is truly a life-changing experience.

*******************************************************************************

The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has ruled against the U.S. 
government in accepting, on January 6, two amicus briefs (friends of the 
court documents presented in support of one side) by the National Lawyers 
Guild, the Florida branch of the National Association of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers, and the National Association of Federal Public Defenders, presented 
in favor of five Cubans imprisoned in the United States.

The U.S. Attorney had motioned the court to reject the two amicus briefs 
alleging that they did not offer a different perspective than that presented 
by the defense attorneys of the Five, and was a means by which to avoid the 
limited number of pages imposed on the defense in its petition to the court. 
However, on January 13, in a motion of response to the court, the U.S. 
Attorney also included an amicus brief by the Cuban-American Bar Association 
supporting its arguments. The court has yet to pronounce on this.

The U.S. Attorney's motion to reject the defense amicus briefs was a 
surprise to the legal community by virtue of the fact that it was extremely 
unusual. It provoked a strong reaction from criminal defense attorneys who 
referred to the protection offered by the Sixth Amendment in relation to 
race, ideology, religious, ethnic and other irrational prejudices.

The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, its Florida branch and 
the National Association of Federal Public Defenders argued in their joint 
amicus that the accused should be able to count on Constitutional guarantees 
for a fair trial.

The importance of this resides in the fact that National Association of 
Criminal Defense Lawyers is the only organization of its kind in Miami-Dade 
County.

For its part, the National Lawyers Guild presented its amicus on the right 
to a fair trial and the right to due process � both established by the Sixth 
Amendment - and emphasized the error of the Florida court in not authorizing 
a change of trial location as well as the inappropriate conduct of the 
prosecution during the trial.

Once accepted by the appeals court, the two amicus now become part of the 
case file it will review. According to procedures established by the Atlanta 
court, on December 15 the defense attorneys presented documents 
corresponding to questions asked by the court. The U.S. Attorney presented 
arguments on January 13, and now the defense can respond to the latter on 
January 27. During the week of February 13, a day will be held for an oral 
presentation by both the defense and the prosecution, designed to respond to 
any concerns or questions the 12 judges may have.

In recent comments on the legal process against the Cuban Five, the 
President of the Cuban National Assembly, Ricardo Alarc�n, underlined the 
violations that had begun from the very day of the arrest of the five men in 
1998, saying "that there should never have been a trial, let alone an 
arrest" and pointed out violations of the Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments 
of the U.S. Constitution.  "In the case of the Cuban Five, the fight should 
go beyond obtaining a new trial for them, but be a battle for their 
immediate release, so they not remain in prison one more day". Alarc�n drew 
attention to the decision by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detentions, which in May of last year � after two years of analysis of the 
case � determined that the trial had been illegal. Following this on August 
9, a three-judge panel of the Atlanta appeals court declared null and void 
the original trial in the Miami federal court. Thus, eight important experts 
from two different forums have expressed their condemnation of the legal 
process against the Five and the illegal sentences imposed upon them.

The National Assembly President stressed the need to continue fighting to 
convert the cause of the Five into an international campaign against 
injustice, and condemn their manipulated trial, demanding their immediate 
release.

Iraq, it has also waged a war against freedom fighters and revolutionaries
in the U.S.

In the past year, the U.S. government has increased the bounty on Assata
Shakur and added her name to the domestic terrorist list, has intervened in
the case of the Cuban 5 in order to undo the decision of the 11th Circuit
Court for a retrial, and masterminded the political assassination of Puerto
Rican revolutionary leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios!!

The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has ruled against the U.S. 
government in accepting, on January 6, two amicus briefs (friends of the 
court documents presented in support of one side) by the National Lawyers 
Guild, the Florida branch of the National Association of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers, and the National Association of Federal Public Defenders, presented 
in favor of five Cubans imprisoned in the United States.

The U.S. Attorney had motioned the court to reject the two amicus briefs 
alleging that they did not offer a different perspective than that presented 
by the defense attorneys of the Five, and was a means by which to avoid the 
limited number of pages imposed on the defense in its petition to the court. 
However, on January 13, in a motion of response to the court, the U.S. 
Attorney also included an amicus brief by the Cuban-American Bar Association 
supporting its arguments. The court has yet to pronounce on this.

The U.S. Attorney's motion to reject the defense amicus briefs was a 
surprise to the legal community by virtue of the fact that it was extremely 
unusual. It provoked a strong reaction from criminal defense attorneys who 
referred to the protection offered by the Sixth Amendment in relation to 
race, ideology, religious, ethnic and other irrational prejudices.

The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, its Florida branch and 
the National Association of Federal Public Defenders argued in their joint 
amicus that the accused should be able to count on Constitutional guarantees 
for a fair trial.

The importance of this resides in the fact that National Association of 
Criminal Defense Lawyers is the only organization of its kind in Miami-Dade 
County.

For its part, the National Lawyers Guild presented its amicus on the right 
to a fair trial and the right to due process � both established by the Sixth 
Amendment - and emphasized the error of the Florida court in not authorizing 
a change of trial location as well as the inappropriate conduct of the 
prosecution during the trial.

Once accepted by the appeals court, the two amicus now become part of the 
case file it will review. According to procedures established by the Atlanta 
court, on December 15 the defense attorneys presented documents 
corresponding to questions asked by the court. The U.S. Attorney presented 
arguments on January 13, and now the defense can respond to the latter on 
January 27. During the week of February 13, a day will be held for an oral 
presentation by both the defense and the prosecution, designed to respond to 
any concerns or questions the 12 judges may have.

In recent comments on the legal process against the Cuban Five, the 
President of the Cuban National Assembly, Ricardo Alarc�n, underlined the 
violations that had begun from the very day of the arrest of the five men in 
1998, saying "that there should never have been a trial, let alone an 
arrest" and pointed out violations of the Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments 
of the U.S. Constitution.  "In the case of the Cuban Five, the fight should 
go beyond obtaining a new trial for them, but be a battle for their 
immediate release, so they not remain in prison one more day". Alarc�n drew 
attention to the decision by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detentions, which in May of last year � after two years of analysis of the 
case � determined that the trial had been illegal. Following this on August 
9, a three-judge panel of the Atlanta appeals court declared null and void 
the original trial in the Miami federal court. Thus, eight important experts 
from two different forums have expressed their condemnation of the legal 
process against the Five and the illegal sentences imposed upon them.

The National Assembly President stressed the need to continue fighting to 
convert the cause of the Five into an international campaign against 
injustice, and condemn their manipulated trial, demanding their immediate 
release.

In August of 2005, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals,

  Prospects for a fair trial are in jeopardy as the U.S. government 
continues to do everything in its power to illegally keep these 5 Cuban

Cuban 5 Prisoner Endures Notorious US "Control Unit"

Spotlight on the Control Unit at US Penitentiary, Florence, Colorado

by Bernie Dwyer

Antonio Guerrero - one of the five Cubans held in US prisons for defending
their country against terrorism - has recently been released from a month in
solitary confinement in what is known as the worst "Control Unit" in the
United States Federal penitentiary system in Florence, Colorado. This
article by Bernie Dwyer spotlights the prison in which Antonio is confined,
describing the dehumanising and brutal effects of this type of imprisonment
in a country that locks up more of its population than any other on the
planet.

Background to Florence USP

The control unit in Florence USP replaced Marion, Illinois, as the highest
security federal prison in the country. Prisoners are kept in permanent
solitary confinement, and are not even allowed to congregate for religious
services. The cells are set up so that prisoners can't see each other, and
can go days without seeing guards. The furniture in their cells is not
movable, physical contact is prohibited among prisoners and during visits,
and telephone calls are limited even more than in regular prisoners.
Florence is located in an area whose water, soil, and air is known to be
contaminated with dangerous radiation levels from a nearby uranium milling
plant.

When the US Federal Bureau of Prisons closed down Alcatraz as its highest
security prison in 1963, prisoners from Alcatraz were moved into Marion
Prison and placed in what was known as 'lock-down'. Lockdown was used to
control and suppress disruptive prisoners by severely restricting prisoners'
rights. Marion was the first prison in the US to make lockdown a permanent
condition. It combined permanent lockdown with sensory deprivation and
special administrative measures, (rather than disciplinary) known as S.A.M.
This means that the conditions are officially justified not as punishment
for prisoners, but as an �administrative� measure. As there are no rules
governing such moves prisoners are denied any due process and prison
officials can incarcerate any prisoner in a control unit for as long as they
choose, without giving a reason.

On October 22, 1983, there was an isolated incident in Marion Prison that
was to effect prison conditions until the present day. Two handcuffed
inmates at the federal prison killed two guards in separate incidents.

In the first, the inmate was walking down the hall, with his hands cuffed in
front of him. He was able to suddenly turn and shove his cuffed hands into
the cell of a friend, who quickly unlocked the cuffs with a stolen key,
handed his friend a knife and the inmate turned around and killed the guard.
Later that day, another inmate used the same lethal tactic.

That was the day that special maximum security measures, known as Management
Control Units were introduced.

Conditions in Management Controlled Units

According to the US Campaign to Abolish Control Unit Prisons, these
Management Control Units are now the new model for prisons in the United
States. Control Units go beyond the usual constraints of even maximum
security prisons. While conditions vary from prison to prison, the goal of
these units is always to cause spiritual, psychological, and physical
breakdown of the prisoners. Included in the oppressive conditions are:

  * Years of isolation from both prison and outside communities while
  being housed in solitary or small group isolation (it is legal in
  the US to lock prisoners up for 23.5 hours / day).

  * denial of access to educational, religious, or work programs.

  * physical torture such as forced cell extractions, four-point
  restraint and hog-tying, caging, beating after restraint, backroom
  beatings, and set-up fights.

  * mental torture such as sensory deprivation, forced idleness,
  verbal harassment, mail tampering, disclosing confidential
  information, confessions forced under torture, and threats against
  family and visitors.

  * denial of access to medical and psychiatric care.
  Prisoners are placed in Control Units for administrative and/or
  disciplinary reasons. The classification hearings, if they occur at
  all, can only be called a "kangaroo court" at which the prisoner is
  denied due process.

Various names are assigned to Control Units -- Adjustment Center, Security
Housing Unit, Maximum Control Complex, Administrative Maximum (Ad-Max),
Special Housing Unit, Violence Control Unit, Special Management Unit,
Intensive Management Unit, etc., also known in prison parlance as the
�Hole�. While every prison has Administrative Segregation cells (Ad-Seg)
used for holding prisoners in short-term disciplinary or protective custody,
Control Units are usually used for long-term punishment.

The "Worst of the Worst"

The isolation unit at Florence penitentiary has the reputation of being the
most brutal. US attorney Leonard Weinglass said that he when he eventually
succeeded in visiting his client Antonio Guerrero, he was shocked to see his
visiting conditions and said that they were worst he had ever encountered
even when visiting his former client, Mumia Abu Jamal on death row.

According to prisoner rights experts, ADX-Florence is the place where the
federal government puts its ``worst of the worst'' prisoners. Florence is
the leader in a nationwide trend toward supermax prisons. More than half the
inmates have murdered somebody in or out of prison. The average sentence is
36 years.

Antonio Guerrero was sentenced without a shred of evidence to life plus 12
years in Florence USP, Colorado. He has the reputation within the
institution of being a model prisoner. He is trustworthy enough to have
special teaching duties. He is not a threat to anybody or country. As far as
the people of Cuba are concerned Antonio was working for a better world.
They feel that to keep him locked up is a miscarriage of justice and putting
him in the �Hole� was a crime. We all believe that it is time he came home
to his country and family.

The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has ruled against the U.S.
government in accepting, on January 6, two amicus briefs (friends of the
court documents presented in support of one side) by the National Lawyers
Guild, the Florida branch of the National Association of Criminal Defense

A Presentation of the most informative and important documentary about the 
Cuban 5:
MISSION AGAINST TERROR AND AN UPDATEON THE CASE OF THE CUBAN 5

Saturday February 4th, 2006 1pm-Reception / 2pm-Film and Program

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Labor Center � Auditorium 310 W. 43rd St. (btwn.
8th &amp; 9th Ave.) Suggested Donation $5 Wheelchair accessible

In August of 2005, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals 
determined that the Cuban 5 didn�t get a fair trial due to the biased 
political environment in Miami and ordered a new trial.

Federal prosecutors requested and were granted an appeal before the entire 
eleven judge panel which is scheduled in Atlanta the week of February 13th.  
Prospects for a fair trial are in jeopardy as the U.S. government continues 
to do everything in its power to illegally keep these 5 Cuban brothers in 
prison.

At this critical time for the 5 and Cuba, the East Coast Tour of Mission 
Against Terror by Bernie Dwyer and Fr. Geoff Bottom is a significant 
opportunity to counter media disinformation and support efforts to educate 
people about the Cuban 5, who are unjustly imprisoned for trying to prevent 
terrorist actions against Cuba.

Program:
1. ANALYSIS/UPDATE: Representative Cuban Mission to the United Nations
2. Screening of Mission Against Terror
3. Bernie Dwyer, Co-director Mission Against Terror
4. Fr. Geoff Bottoms, British Cuba Solidarity Campaign, President UK Free
the Cuban Five Committee

Convener: Ministry of Solidarity with Cuba, Church of San Romero de las
Am�ricas

Sponsors:  National Committee to Free the Cuban Five, New York Committee to
Free the Cuban Five, Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5,
Venceremos Brigade, Casa de las Am�ricas, Cuba Solidarity New York,
IFCO/Pastors for Peace, ProLibertad Freedom Campaign, International ANSWER,
International Action Center, Party for Socialism and Liberation, Fuerzas de
la Revoluci�n Dominicana, Workers World Party, Frente Socialista de Puerto
Rico � NY (list in formation).

The Popular Education Project  to Free the Cuban 5 is calling on all freedom 
loving people to support this new initiativeto grant the families of the 
Cuban 5 visas to visit them.  Due to the U.S. government�s denial to approve 
visas,  Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo�s wife and daughter have not seen him in 
six years.  Also, Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert has not seen his wife and daughter 
in 4 years.  Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and 
children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged 
periods of time to issue them visas.

The U.S. government�s denial of visitation rights is cruel and draconian.  
Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family 
members are a threat to national security.

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 needs your help in 
pressuring Louise Arbour, the High Commissioner of Human Rights of the 
United Nations Office of Geneva, so she can intercede in this matter and 
request the U.S. government grant visas to the family members of the Cuban 
5.

Protest FBI Repression In Puerto Rico:
All Out Monday, February 13th!
U.S. Federal Building � 26 Federal Plaza at Broadway, 5pm

The Prolibertad Freedom Campaign denounces the wave of repression begun 
today, Friday, February 10, 2006, in Puerto Rico by the FBI, directed 
against the independence movement and its supporters.

We urge all our friends and supporters to unite behind the call being made 
by the independence movement in New York to rally in front of the U.S. 
Federal Building (26 Federal Plaza at Broadway) this coming Monday, February 
13, 2006, at 5pm.

At the U.S. Federal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico, today more than a 
1,000 Boricuas protested these attacks and called for protest demonstrations 
internationally.

We must join the call from Puerto Rico to protest these FBI/U.S. Government 
attacks on the people of Puerto Rico and call for protest demonstrations 
throughout U.S., Latin America, the Caribbean and internationally.

A message sent by Filiberto�s longtime attorney today, gives a clear picture 
of what is taking place in Puerto Rico and our peoples response:

The People Take To The Streets
By Luis F. Abreu Elias

Today in Puerto Rico various searches of homes and arrests are being carried 
out the F.B.I.  Some of those arrested are Lilliana Laboy the labor leader 
and Executive Secretary of the The Caribbean and Latin American Coordinating 
Group of Puerto Rico: William Mohler, pro-independence community leader who 
lives in the town of Lim�n, Mayaguez.  In addition, Jos� Rodr�guez, a 
pro-independence activist, town leader and retiree was also arrested.  They 
are also searching and ransacking their homes since the early hours of this 
morning.  This is yet another escalation of FBI persecution due to the 
upsurge and militancy of the independence movement since the assassination 
of Filiberto Ojeda R�os.

They have used mustard gas on the wife of William Mohler even when she 
offered no resistance. When they went at dawn to search Mohler�s home only 
his wife was there.  The press says that they have 20 additional arrest 
warrants and it is not known if they are for arrests and search or just for 
searches.  They are looking for Norberto Cintr�n Fiallo a well known 
independence leader and a prominent member of the Coordinating Group.  His 
compa�eras apartment was searched for more than 11 hours.  They brought FBI 
agents from Miami and other states.  They make a show of force using long 
range weapons and firearms and dozens of cars.  At each home they have 
dozens of agents.  100 Boricuas just confronted the FBI in front of the 
apartment of Norberto Cintr�n�s compa�era.  They have thrown rocks at the 
FBI and have broken the car windows of the FBI who have fled while throwing 
mustard gas with guns drawn.  The FBI agents have been spat upon by the 
people as they fled the scene.  At this moment the press entered the 
apartment of Do�a Lilliana.

The press reports at this moment that the apartment of Compa�era Lilliana 
Labory was left destroyed by the FBI.  Reporters were thrown on the ground 
by the FBI.  There are injured among the reporters.

We shall keep you informed about this great escalation of  hitlerian facism 
by Hitler�s inheritor, George Bush.  The indignation in Puerto Rico grows 
and hundreds of people have hit the streets near the places where these 
break-ins are taking place.

This Yankee Gestapo will not be able to stop the struggle for independence.

This report was sent by Luis F. Abreu El�as, who for more than 30 years has 
been the attorney for Filiberto Ojeda R�os, Comandante of the Macheteros, 
who was assassinated by the FBI on September 23, 2005.

EL PUEBLO SALE A LAS CALLES
Por Luis F. Abreu Elias.

En el d�a de hoy se est�n llevando a cabo, en Puerto Rico, varios 
allanamientos de residencias y arrestos, por parte del FBI. Algunos de los 
arrestados son Lilliana Laboy dirigente sindicalista, y Secretaria Ejecutiva 
de la Coordinadora Caribe�a y Latinoamericana de Puerto Rico: William 
Mohler, l�der comunitario independentista que vive en el Bo. Lim�n de 
Mayag�ez Adem�s se arrest� al Sr. Jos� Rodr�guez, independentista, l�der de 
barrio, y ya retirado. Tambi�n se le est�n registrando y allanando sus 
residencias, desde horas de la madrugada. Esto es una escalada m�s de la 
persecuci�n del FBI debido al auge y militancia que ha tomado el 
independentismo desde el asesinato de Filiberto Ojeda R�os.

Han tirado gas mostaza a esposa de William Mohler sin que ella ofreciera 
resistencia, Cuando fueron de madrugada a registrar la casa de Mohler quien 
estaba era su esposa. Se dice por la prensa que tienen veinte �rdenes 
adicionales, y no se sabe si son de arresto y registro y allanamientos o 
solo de registro y allanamiento. Buscan a Norberto Cintr�n Fiallo conocido 
l�der Independentista y miembro prominente de la Coordinadora. Registran por 
m�s de 11 horas el apartamento de su compa�era. Trajeron agentes del FBI 
desde Miami y de otros estados. Hacen una demostraci�n de fuerza con armas 
largas y decenas de autos. En cada casa tienen decenas de agentes.

Se acaban de enfrentar al FBI 100 boricuas frente al apartamento de la 
compa�era de Norberto Cintr�n. Le han tirado piedras al FBI y le han roto 
los cristales de los veh�culos del FBI quienes han salido huyendo lanzando 
gas mostaza y con armas en la mano. Los agentes han sido escupidos por el 
pueblo cuando sal�an huyendo. En este instante la prensa entra al apto de 
Do�a Lilliana.

La prensa informa en este instante que el apartamento de la compa�era 
Lilliana Laboy fue dejado destruido por el FBI. Los periodistas fueron 
lanzados al piso por FBI. Hay heridos entre los periodistas.

Les mantendremos informados de esta gran escalada de represi�n del fascismo 
hitleriano del heredero de Hitler, George Bush. Crece la indignaci�n en PR y 
ya cientos de personas se tiran a las calles cercanas a los lugares donde se 
llevan a cabo los allanamientos.
No podr�n detener la lucha por la independencia estos gestapos yankis.

The Popular Education Project  to Free the Cuban 5 is calling on all freedom
loving people to support this new initiativeto grant the families of the
Cuban 5 visas to visit them.  Due to the U.S. government's denial to approve
visas,  Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo's wife and daughter have not seen him in
six years.  Also, Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert has not seen his wife and daughter
in 4 years.  Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and
children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged
periods of time to issue them visas.

The U.S. government's denial of visitation rights is cruel and draconian.
Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family
members are a threat to national security.

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 needs your help in
pressuring Louise Arbour, the High Commissioner of Human Rights of the
United Nations Office of Geneva, so she can intercede in this matter and
request the U.S. government grant visas to the family members of the Cuban
5.

UPDATE ON THE ORAL ARGUMENTS HEARD IN ATLANTA FOR THE CUBAN 5!!  READ THE 
ARTICLE BELOW AND THEN JOIN US ON THURSDAY FOR A PEOPLE'S UPDATE ON THE CASE 
OF THE CUBAN 5!!

Bernie Dwyer (Radio Havana Cuba) - Feb 14, 2006
Cuban Five:  Atlanta Appeals Court Judge Has Prosecution on the Ropes

Atlanta, 14th February, (RHC)--Today�s hearing on the case of the five
Cubans incarcerated in US prisons on charges of being a threat to the
security of the United States, among others, at the Elbert P. Tuttle
court room of the 11th Circuit Appeals court house in Atlanta took
nobody by surprise. According to defense lawyers, Leonard Weinglass,
representing Antonio Guerrero and Paul McKenna, defending Gerardo
Hernandez, the line of questioning by the twelve judges of the appeals
court was what they had expected and were prepared for.

The court room was packed for the hearing which started at 9am and
continued for one hour. The time allotted to hear the defense and
prosecution was equally divided between both sides. Family members of
the five Cubans were present for the hearing alongside international
observers and supporters.  Representatives of the anti-Cuban terrorist
groups in Miami also attended.

On August 9th 2005 the three judge panel of the Court overturned the
convictions and sentences of Gerardo Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero, Ramon
Labanino, Rene Gonzalez and Fernando Gonzalez on the grounds that they
could not receive a fair and impartial hearing in the hostile climate of
Miami. The District Attorney in Miami asked for a re-hearing of the case
following consultation with Washington which was accepted by a majority
of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The oral arguments centered on the issue of venue and jury selection
with Leonard Weinglass, , and Richard Klugh, Public Defender in Miami,
presenting the case for the defense and Richard Buckner acting for the
US prosecution.

The vigorous questioning of both the defense and the prosecution
addressed the key issue of whether or not there is pervasive community
prejudice in Miami that would require a retrial in an alternative
location. Judge Birch, who presided at the original appeal hearing, made
several interventions that put the prosecution on the defensive and
enabled the defense to sharpen its arguments.

Weinglass believed that the case had received a fair hearing and was
confident that the twelve judges would now give full consideration to
the arguments. He was hopeful and optimistic that finally after seven
years the convictions of the Five would be reversed.

The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has never found in favor of the
defense so history would be made if the original appeal finding were
upheld. The fact that Presiding Judge Edmondson did not intervene in the
questioning is seen as favorable by the defense team.

Defense lawyer Paul McKenna told Radio Havana Cuba in a short interview
after the hearing that Judge Birch came out very strongly on the
question of jury interference and intimidation during the Miami trial.
McKenna pointed out that the problem went on throughout the trial where
jurors were followed to their cars and had their license plates
photographed, which were shown on Miami television during the duration
of the trial. McKenna stated that Judge Birch caught the prosecution on
that issue and �like a boxer, had him on the ropes�.

During a press conference at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, Atlanta, Leonard
Weinglass described the Miami trial of the five Cuban anti-terrorists
fighters as �a perfect storm of prejudice�

The decision of the 12 judges of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta is expected within two months.

<pre>        Gravitizer is a sex tool, which brings dozens of new positions
for you to try!

New positions. Go beyond KamaSutra by practising positions you would never
perform without Gravitizer!
Standard positions. Gravitizer saves energy in standard positions. By minimizing
the amount of energy 
and attention spent on the mechanical routine of sex you can maximize the
sensation of sex itself.

to mark your calendars/palm pilots/Day Planners/Agendas with the following 
events around Puerto Rico taking place in NYC.

Now more than ever we need solidarity and mutual support!!

FREE THE PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONERS!!
_______________________________________________________________________________

The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance calls all BAAD ASS women and all those 
who love and appreciate BAAD ASS women in a tribute to BAAD ASS brujas. We 
lovingly chose the term "Brujas" because instead of conforming to societal 
dictates we resist and rage against injustice, against oppression, against 
the system, and against "the man". With their "witch hunts", the system 
likes to persecute, abuse and ultimately destroy fierce, revolutionary 
women, but the purpose of the BAAD ASS Women's Festival is to honor them and 
celebrate them as we should.

Saturday, March 25th, 2006
4-6 PM

TRIBUTE TO DYLCIA PAGAN &amp; YASMIN HERNANDEZ�S BAAD! ASS BRUJAS.
BAAD! presents a special event honoring Puerto Rican freedom fighter Dylcia 
Pagan, who spent 20 years in U.S. prisons for her participation in the 
Puerto Rican liberation struggle. Ms. Pagan shares an intimate talk on her 
experiences and of women who stand strong and stare down opposition. Joining 
Ms. Pagan will be painter and artist Yasmin Hernandez who will share a slide 
show of BAAD! ASS BRUJAS and talk about their histories and contributions to 
the world.

At Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD), 841 Barretto Street. Hunts Point, 
Bronx, NYC.
(6 Train to Hunts Point, cross under Bruckner overpass, walk one block, make 
a right and then a left at Barretto Street)

Zuhdi Al-Adawi
"Made in Palestine" Artist and Former Political Prisoner . . . plus 
Solidarity with Political Prisoners everywhere!

The Bridge
521 W. 26th St. 3rd Floor
New York City
5:00 p.m. reception
6:00 p.m. presentation

Zuhdi al-Adawi is a Palestinian artist and former political prisoner whose 
work is part of the "Made in Palestine" exhibition. While imprisoned in 
Ashkelon prison, he taught himself to make art, and secretly made art during 
his time in prison, hiding his work and sneaking it out with visitors; when 
his art was discovered, he would be thrown in solitary confinement. In 1985, 
Zuhdi al-Adawi was released in a prisoner exchange but was exiled to 
Lebanon; he since moved to Damascus, Syria, where he lives today.

Please join us to hear about his experiences, his life, and his art, and to 
honor this freedom fighter for Palestine, as an activist and as an artist.

We will also hear reports from our allies on political prisoner struggles in 
other movements. Come to learn more about Assata Shakur, Mumia Abu-Jamal, 
Leonard Peltier, and struggles in Puerto Rico and the Philippines!

The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance calls all BAAD ASS women and all those 
who love and appreciate BAAD ASS women in a tribute to BAAD ASS brujas. We 
lovingly chose the term "Brujas" because instead of conforming to societal 
dictates we resist and rage against injustice, against oppression, against 
the system, and against "the man". With their "witch hunts", the system 
likes to persecute, abuse and ultimately destroy fierce, revolutionary 
women, but the purpose of the BAAD ASS Women's Festival is to honor them and 
celebrate them as we should.

4-6 PM

TRIBUTE TO DYLCIA PAGAN &amp; YASMIN HERNANDEZ�S BAAD! ASS BRUJAS.

Puerto Rican liberation struggle. Ms. Pagan shares an intimate talk on her

Ms. Pagan will be painter and artist Yasmin Hernandez who will share a slide 
show of BAAD! ASS BRUJAS and talk about their histories and contributions to 
the world.

At Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (BAAD), 841 Barretto Street. Hunts Point,

New York City
5:00 p.m. reception

Zuhdi al-Adawi is a Palestinian artist and former political prisoner whose 
work is part of the "Made in Palestine" exhibition. While imprisoned in 
Ashkelon prison, he taught himself to make art, and secretly made art during 
his time in prison, hiding his work and sneaking it out with visitors; when 
his art was discovered, he would be thrown in solitary confinement. In 1985, 
Zuhdi al-Adawi was released in a prisoner exchange but was exiled to 
Lebanon; he since moved to Damascus, Syria, where he lives today.

Please join us to hear about his experiences, his life, and his art, and to

Dear Friends,

Greetings!

I am writing to cordially invite you to attend  a  48 minute documentary on 
the Cuban 5:  �Mission Against Terror� which document on  the incarcerated  
five (5) Cubans in U.S. prisons for defending their country and people 
against terrorist activities planned and executed from Miami since the Cuban 
Revolution.

A brief presentation will be made by representatives  of the Cuban Mission 
to the United Nations and the  Committee to Defend the Five Cubans in U.S.  
Prisons.

I look forward to your attending this very important  event which will be 
followed by a small reception.

This event will be held on:

Friday, March 17, 2006
Church Center for the United Nations
777 United Nations Plaza, 2nd Floor (corner of  44th Street and First Ave.)
6:00 pm to 8:30 p.m.

Sincerely,

Esmeralda V. Brown
Resource Center Specialist, Economic and Environmental Justice

If you have any questions, or need additional information, please feel free 
to contact me at: (212) 682-3633 extension 3102.

*******************************************************************************

The Popular Education Project  to Free the Cuban 5 is calling on all freedom
loving people to support this new initiativeto grant the families of the
Cuban 5 visas to visit them.  Due to the U.S. government's denial to approve
visas,  Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo's wife and daughter have not seen him in
six years.  Also, Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert has not seen his wife and daughter
in 4 years.  Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and
children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged
periods of time to issue them visas.

The U.S. government's denial of visitation rights is cruel and draconian.
Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family
members are a threat to national security.

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 needs your help in
pressuring Louise Arbour, the High Commissioner of Human Rights of the
United Nations Office of Geneva, so she can intercede in this matter and
request the U.S. government grant visas to the family members of the Cuban
5.

Despierta Boricua is a fifteen minute Radio segment produced for WBAI 99.5 
FM Friday Morning Wake UP Call by The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign.  
Despierta Boricua airs at 6:45am every Friday; Despierta Boricua is 
dedicated to providing our listening audience with the latest news/updates 
on Puerto Rican politics/culture from throughout the Puerto Rican Diaspora 
and Puerto Rico.

This week's segment, Friday March 17th, will feature an interview with Ramon 
Jimenez about the 30th anniversary of the Hostos Community College Take 
over.  On March 25th 1976, a coalition of Students, Professors, and 
Community activists took over Hostos Community College (H.C.C.). The 23 days 
that followed, (longest College take over in history) set the stage for a 
multi tactical campaign that saved the institution from the planned closure. 
This is one of the most successful campaigns in our community�s history and 
as a result 30 years later presently, HCC continues to provide bi-lingual 
education to the Spanish speaking migrant &amp; immigrant community.

In commemoration of the 26th anniversary of a series of arrests that began 
on April 4th, 1980, ProLibertad has dedicated the month of April to the 
Puerto Rican Political Prisoners; we call it FREEDOM MONTH!!  This month is 
full of activities and events to raise awareness about the Puerto Rican 
Political Prisoners and to inspire people to join the movement to free our 
Freedom fighters!!

We freed the Nationalists in the 1970s!! We freed some of the prisoners in 
1999!!  We can make freedom happen again!!  JOIN THE MOVEMENT!!

WE CANNOT FORGET OUR PRISONERS!! OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA, CARLOS ALBNERTO TORRES 
AND HAYDEE BELTRAN PRESENTE!!

SOME HISTORY:
Starting on April 4th, 1980, fourteen people accused of being members of the 
Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN, its acronym in Spanish) were 
arrested. At the time of their arrest they declared themselves to be 
combatants in an anti-colonial war to liberate Puerto Rico from U.S. 
domination and invoked prisoner of war status.

They argued that the U.S. courts and its political subdivisions did not have 
jurisdiction to try them as criminals and petitioned for their cases to be 
handed over to an international, impartial court that would determine their 
status. The U.S. government did not recognize their request.  These brothers 
and sisters became the first crop of Puerto Rican Political Prisoners to be 
incarcerated in the 1980s; to be followed by several members of Los 
Macheteros in 1985.

In Sept. 1999, President William Clinton granted several of the Puerto Rican 
Political Prisoners clemency, but three of these compa�er@s are still in 
prison.  They are Oscar Lopez Rivera, Haydee Beltran Torres, and Carlos 
Alberto Torres!!

For the past 26 years, the international community has called for their 
release!!  Join the millions of voices that cry out for freedom and 
justice!!  We need your talent, enthusiasm, creativity, organizing skills 
and your energy!!  Join ProLibertad!!  Contact us at ProLibertad@...

The Popular Education Project  to Free the Cuban 5 is calling on all freedom 
loving people to support this new initiative to grant the families of the 
Cuban 5 visas to visit them.

Due to the U.S. government's denial to approve visas,  Gerardo Hernandez 
Nordelo's wife and daughter have not seen him in six years.  Also, Rene 
Gonzalez Sehwerert has not seen his wife and daughter in 4 years.  Others in 
the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity, 
because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue 
them visas.

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 needs your help in 
pressuring Louise Arbour, the High Commissioner of Human Rights of the 
United Nations Office of Geneva, so she can intercede in this matter and 
request the U.S. government grant visas to the family members of the Cuban 
5.

Detenido el ex l�der de los macheteros Antonio Camacho
Mi�rcoles, 29 de marzo de 2006
Por Daniel Rivera Vargas
End.drivera@...

Justo el d�a en que se celebraban vistas congresionales sobre supuestos 
abusos en las intervenciones recientes del Negociado Federal de 
Investigaciones (FBI, por sus siglas en ingl�s) en Puerto Rico, agentes de 
esa agencia arrestaron ayer al ex l�der machetero Antonio Camacho Negr�n.
�Fue arrestado hoy (ayer) por la tarde por agentes del FBI sin incidentes�, 
dijo Harry Rodr�guez, portavoz del Negociado.

Explic� que Camacho Negr�n, un yaucano de 65 a�os de edad, fue arrestado 
entre las 4:00 y 4:30 p.m. de ayer en San Juan por violar los t�rminos de su 
libertad condicional.
En una audiencia congresional se discut�an ayer alegados excesos del FBI 
durante el operativo de septiembre en que el jefe m�ximo de Los Macheteros, 
Filiberto Ojeda R�os result� muerto, y el incidente en que agentes federales 
rociaron gas pimienta y empujaron a periodistas durante uno de los 
allanamientos a independentistas supuestamente vinculados a este grupo 
clandestino, en febrero pasado.

Los rumores de su inminente arresto circulaban desde hace tiempo y en 
expresiones publicadas en un portal de Internet en octubre de 2005, Camacho 
Negr�n dijo: �El FBI est� interesado en secuestrarme por informaci�n que yo 
he recopilado relacionada a la muerte de Filiberto�.

La informaci�n en poder de Rodr�guez ayer era que la presunta violaci�n a 
los t�rminos de libertad condicional por el independentista se cometi� el 20 
de agosto de 2004, hace a�o y medio. No se explic� por qu� fue hasta ayer 
que detuvieron a Camacho Negr�n, cuando era visto p�blicamente en

Camacho Negr�n fue encarcelado anoche en el Centro Metropolitano de 
Denuncias de Guaynabo, mejor conocida como la c�rcel federal. El l�der 
machetero tiene derecho a una vista ante la Junta federal de Libertad 
Condicional en la que puede estar representado por abogados y llevar 
testigos, se indic�.

Camacho Negr�n sali� en probatoria el 17 de agosto de 2004 tras una d�cada 
cumpliendo c�rcel por conspirar para transportar dinero robado, relacionado 
al robo de $7.2 millones a un dep�sito de la Wells Fargo, que el Ej�rcito 
Popular Boricua-Los Macheteros llev� a cabo en 1983, en Connecticut.
Es la tercera vez que arrestan a Camacho Negr�n, dijo Rodr�guez. La primera 
por el robo al cami�n, la segunda por violar por primera vez sus condiciones 
de libertad y ayer la tercera.

Detenido el ex l�der de los macheteros Antonio Camacho
Mi�rcoles, 29 de marzo de 2006

Justo el d�a en que se celebraban vistas congresionales sobre supuestos 
abusos en las intervenciones recientes del Negociado Federal de 
Investigaciones (FBI, por sus siglas en ingl�s) en Puerto Rico, agentes de 
esa agencia arrestaron ayer al ex l�der machetero Antonio Camacho Negr�n.
�Fue arrestado hoy (ayer) por la tarde por agentes del FBI sin incidentes�, 
dijo Harry Rodr�guez, portavoz del Negociado.

Explic� que Camacho Negr�n, un yaucano de 65 a�os de edad, fue arrestado 
entre las 4:00 y 4:30 p.m. de ayer en San Juan por violar los t�rminos de su 
libertad condicional.
En una audiencia congresional se discut�an ayer alegados excesos del FBI 
durante el operativo de septiembre en que el jefe m�ximo de Los Macheteros, 
Filiberto Ojeda R�os result� muerto, y el incidente en que agentes federales 
rociaron gas pimienta y empujaron a periodistas durante uno de los 
allanamientos a independentistas supuestamente vinculados a este grupo 
clandestino, en febrero pasado.

Los rumores de su inminente arresto circulaban desde hace tiempo y en 
expresiones publicadas en un portal de Internet en octubre de 2005, Camacho 
Negr�n dijo: �El FBI est� interesado en secuestrarme por informaci�n que yo 
he recopilado relacionada a la muerte de Filiberto�.

La informaci�n en poder de Rodr�guez ayer era que la presunta violaci�n a 
los t�rminos de libertad condicional por el independentista se cometi� el 20 
de agosto de 2004, hace a�o y medio. No se explic� por qu� fue hasta ayer 
que detuvieron a Camacho Negr�n, cuando era visto p�blicamente en 
actividades masivas incluso frente a la Corte Federal.

Hunter College Hostos Puerto Rican Club Room

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign has been working for the release of the
Puerto Rican Political Prisoners for over 10 years.  With the release of 11
of the Political Prisoners in September 1999, we have re-dedicated our
efforts to securing the freedom of the remaining Puerto Rican political
prisoners.  Through educational events, lobbying and public pressure work
and activities it is our goal to secure the freedom of these patriots whose
only "crime" has been the love of their home land, Puerto Rico.  We support
the release of All U.S. held Political Prisoners, oppose the U.S. colonial
control of Puerto Rico, U.S. imperialism throughout the world, and the U.S.
military presence in Vieques

Join us in watching powerful political films like:

The Popular Education Project  to Free the Cuban 5 is calling on all freedom
loving people to support this new initiative to grant the families of the
Cuban 5 visas to visit them.

Due to the U.S. government's denial to approve visas,  Gerardo Hernandez
Nordelo's wife and daughter have not seen him in six years.  Also, Rene
Gonzalez Sehwerert has not seen his wife and daughter in 4 years.  Others in
the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity,
because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue
them visas.

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 needs your help in
pressuring Louise Arbour, the High Commissioner of Human Rights of the
United Nations Office of Geneva, so she can intercede in this matter and
request the U.S. government grant visas to the family members of the Cuban

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign has been working for the release of the

of the Political Prisoners in September 1999, we have re-dedicated our
efforts to securing the freedom of the remaining Puerto Rican political
prisoners.  Through educational events, lobbying and public pressure work
and activities it is our goal to secure the freedom of these patriots whose
only "crime" has been the love of their home land, Puerto Rico.  We support
the release of All U.S. held Political Prisoners, oppose the U.S. colonial
control of Puerto Rico, U.S. imperialism throughout the world, and the U.S.
military presence in Vieques

Thursday, March 30, 2006 Linda Backiel, Lawyer for

Antonio Camacho Negrn

Last night I met with Antonio.  He is in solitary confinement because he
refused to answer questions that are made of new prisoners.  He is not
receiving his medicines and his cell is flooded.  He is not being given
toilet paper.

As always his spirits are high.  I understand that his arrest on the
afternoon of the first day of the National Congress for Decolonization is
due to a desire to repress those efforts.  He is the national organizer of
the Congress and dedicated it to the political prisoners just before being
arrested around 4:00 p.m. in a street in Ro Piedras.

Antonio declared that "The Congress that is taking place simultaneously in
several universities and colleges throughout the country by all
anti-colonial sectors has received tremendous support and the government of
the United States is making its move to once again attempt to repress the
desires of our people to regain its sovereignty."

He reiterated that his stand in the towards the courts is the same as
always: he does not recognize their jurisdiction.  "The Federal Court is not
in Puerto Rico to meet out justice, but to kidnap the sovereignty of the
people of Puerto Rico and to impose the expansionist imperialist policies of
the United States.  What is good for the hunter is not good for the hunted."

Antonio also emphasized the fact that just before his arrest by the same
federal agents that arrested him at the Congress, he had just asked all
those present, not for a minute of silence, but a minute of applause for
Filiberto Ojeda Ros.

It is important to note that a support picket for Antonio was organized on
Saturday April 1st in front of MDC Guyanabo.

The organizers will continue organizing pickets every

Saturday until Antonio is released from jail!!

ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON NEEDS OUR SUPPORT!!

MEDICATION!!

Download this letter to the MDC Guaynabo Warden and mail it out or fax it!!  
Express your rage and indignation of the torture of this revolutionary!!

http://www.prolibertadweb.com/AntonioCamachoLetter.pdf

Thursday, March 30, 2006 Linda Backiel, Lawyer for Antonio Camacho Negr�n

Last night I met with Antonio.  He is in solitary confinement because he 
refused to answer questions that are made of new prisoners.  He is not 
receiving his medicines and his cell is flooded.  He is not being given 
toilet paper.

As always his spirits are high.  I understand that his arrest on the 
afternoon of the first day of the National Congress for Decolonization is 
due to a desire to repress those efforts.  He is the national organizer of 
the Congress and dedicated it to the political prisoners just before being 
arrested around 4:00 p.m. in a street in R�o Piedras.

Antonio declared that "The Congress that is taking place simultaneously in 
several universities and colleges throughout the country by all 
anti-colonial sectors has received tremendous support and the government of 
the United States is making its move to once again attempt to repress the 
desires of our people to regain its sovereignty."

He reiterated that his stand in the towards the courts is the same as 
always: he does not recognize their jurisdiction.  "The Federal Court is not 
in Puerto Rico to meet out justice, but to kidnap the sovereignty of the 
people of Puerto Rico and to impose the expansionist imperialist policies of 
the United States.  What is good for the hunter is not good for the hunted."

Antonio also emphasized the fact that just before his arrest by the same 
federal agents that arrested him at the Congress, he had just asked all 
those present, not for a minute of silence, but a minute of applause for 
Filiberto Ojeda R�os.

It is important to note that a support picket for Antonio was organized on 
Saturday April 1st in front of MDC Guyanabo.  The organizers will continue 
organizing pickets every Saturday until Antonio is released from jail!!

An evening with noted Cuban 5 Attorney Leonard Weinglass

the Cuban 5.

Thursday, April 20, 7pm
Columbia Law School
Jerome L. Green Hall
435 West 116th St.
New York City

The Cuban Five political prisoners, who have already served seven and a half
years in U.S. prisons, due to their unjust convictions and sentences, had
their appeals heard in oral arguments before an "en banc" hearing, in the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals, on February 14. Weinglass will address the
legal issues in the appellate case.

The year 2006 will be crucial in the legal and political battle to win
freedom for these five men. Gerardo Hern�ndez, Antonio Guerrero, Ram�n
Laba�ino, Fernando Gonz�lez, and Ren� Gonz�lez are anti-terrorists activists
who were stopping terrorists from carrying out attacks on the island of
Cuba.

In commemoration of the 26th anniversary of a series of arrests that began
on April 4th, 1980, ProLibertad has dedicated the month of April to the
Puerto Rican Political Prisoners; we call it FREEDOM MONTH!!  This month is
full of activities and events to raise awareness about the Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners and to inspire people to join the movement to free our
Freedom fighters!!

We freed the Nationalists in the 1970s!! We freed some of the prisoners in
1999!!  We can make freedom happen again!!  JOIN THE MOVEMENT!!

WE CANNOT FORGET OUR PRISONERS!! OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA, CARLOS ALBNERTO TORRES
AND HAYDEE BELTRAN PRESENTE!!

SOME HISTORY:
Starting on April 4th, 1980, fourteen people accused of being members of the
Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN, its acronym in Spanish) were
arrested. At the time of their arrest they declared themselves to be
combatants in an anti-colonial war to liberate Puerto Rico from U.S.
domination and invoked prisoner of war status.

They argued that the U.S. courts and its political subdivisions did not have
jurisdiction to try them as criminals and petitioned for their cases to be
handed over to an international, impartial court that would determine their
status. The U.S. government did not recognize their request.  These brothers
and sisters became the first crop of Puerto Rican Political Prisoners to be
incarcerated in the 1980s; to be followed by several members of Los
Macheteros in 1985.

In Sept. 1999, President William Clinton granted several of the Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners clemency, but three of these compa�er@s are still in
prison.  They are Oscar Lopez Rivera, Haydee Beltran Torres, and Carlos
Alberto Torres!!

For the past 26 years, the international community has called for their
release!!  Join the millions of voices that cry out for freedom and
justice!!  We need your talent, enthusiasm, creativity, organizing skills
and your energy!!  Join ProLibertad!!  Contact us at ProLibertad@...

In commemoration of the 26th anniversary of a series of arrests that began
on April 4th, 1980, ProLibertad has dedicated the month of April to the
Puerto Rican Political Prisoners; we call it FREEDOM MONTH!!  This month is
full of activities and events to raise awareness about the Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners and to inspire people to join the movement to free our
Freedom fighters!!

We freed the Nationalists in the 1970s!! We freed some of the prisoners in
1999!!  We can make freedom happen again!!  JOIN THE MOVEMENT!!

WE CANNOT FORGET OUR PRISONERS!! OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA, CARLOS ALBNERTO TORRES
AND HAYDEE BELTRAN PRESENTE!!

SOME HISTORY:
Starting on April 4th, 1980, fourteen people accused of being members of the
Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN, its acronym in Spanish) were
arrested. At the time of their arrest they declared themselves to be
combatants in an anti-colonial war to liberate Puerto Rico from U.S.
domination and invoked prisoner of war status.

They argued that the U.S. courts and its political subdivisions did not have
jurisdiction to try them as criminals and petitioned for their cases to be
handed over to an international, impartial court that would determine their
status. The U.S. government did not recognize their request.  These brothers
and sisters became the first crop of Puerto Rican Political Prisoners to be
incarcerated in the 1980s; to be followed by several members of Los
Macheteros in 1985.

In Sept. 1999, President William Clinton granted several of the Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners clemency, but three of these compa�er@s are still in
prison.  They are Oscar Lopez Rivera, Haydee Beltran Torres, and Carlos
Alberto Torres!!

For the past 26 years, the international community has called for their
release!!  Join the millions of voices that cry out for freedom and
justice!!  We need your talent, enthusiasm, creativity, organizing skills
and your energy!!  Join ProLibertad!!  Contact us at ProLibertad@...

Real testimonials: 

"I was originally amazed that the first two pills I took of Hoodia 920+, almost immediately took my cravings away.
Now 4 weeks later, 3 belt holes later,
I have become an advocate for this awesomely powerful, natural supplement!" 
Amelia B., New York

"I tried Hoodia 920+ after visiting your website, and I lost a few pounds without doing anything else.
I was so amazed I decided to start exercising and getting outside more and I even starting eating better.
Now I don't even look like the same man. Friends I haven't seen for more than a year don't even recognize me.
The change is that dramatic! Thank you . Hoodia 920+ really works!"

In commemoration of the 26th anniversary of a series of arrests that began
on April 4th, 1980, ProLibertad has dedicated the month of April to the
Puerto Rican Political Prisoners; we call it FREEDOM MONTH!!  This month is
full of activities and events to raise awareness about the Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners and to inspire people to join the movement to free our
Freedom fighters!!

We freed the Nationalists in the 1970s!! We freed some of the prisoners in
1999!!  We can make freedom happen again!!  JOIN THE MOVEMENT!!

WE CANNOT FORGET OUR PRISONERS!! OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA, CARLOS ALBNERTO TORRES
AND HAYDEE BELTRAN PRESENTE!!

SOME HISTORY:
Starting on April 4th, 1980, fourteen people accused of being members of the
Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN, its acronym in Spanish) were
arrested. At the time of their arrest they declared themselves to be
combatants in an anti-colonial war to liberate Puerto Rico from U.S.
domination and invoked prisoner of war status.

They argued that the U.S. courts and its political subdivisions did not have
jurisdiction to try them as criminals and petitioned for their cases to be
handed over to an international, impartial court that would determine their
status. The U.S. government did not recognize their request.  These brothers
and sisters became the first crop of Puerto Rican Political Prisoners to be
incarcerated in the 1980s; to be followed by several members of Los
Macheteros in 1985.

In Sept. 1999, President William Clinton granted several of the Puerto Rican
Political Prisoners clemency, but three of these compa�er@s are still in
prison.  They are Oscar Lopez Rivera, Haydee Beltran Torres, and Carlos
Alberto Torres!!

For the past 26 years, the international community has called for their
release!!  Join the millions of voices that cry out for freedom and
justice!!  We need your talent, enthusiasm, creativity, organizing skills
and your energy!!  Join ProLibertad!!  Contact us at ProLibertad@...

the Cuban 5.

Thursday, April 20, 7pm

The Cuban Five political prisoners, who have already served seven and a half

their appeals heard in oral arguments before an "en banc" hearing, in the

Real testimonials: 

"I was originally amazed that the first two pills I took of Hoodia 920+, almost immediately took my cravings away.
Now 4 weeks later, 3 belt holes later,
I have become an advocate for this awesomely powerful, natural supplement!" 
Amely S., Bellevue WA

"I tried Hoodia 920+ after visiting your website, and I lost a few pounds without doing anything else.
I was so amazed I decided to start exercising and getting outside more and I even starting eating better.
Now I don't even look like the same man. Friends I haven't seen for more than a year don't even recognize me.
The change is that dramatic! Thank you . Hoodia 920+ really works!"

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling for the formation of the Antonio 
Camacho Negron Freedom Fund!!  Antonio has asked us not to send him money 
directly, but to create a fund for his use when he is released from prison.  
We are asking all freedom-loving justice-believing people to send a donation 
(any amount is appreciated) to the following address:

IFCO/ProLibertad
418 W145th St.
New York, N.Y. 10031

Please endorse the check or money order to: IFCO/ProLibertad and write 
"Antonio Camacho Negron Freedom Fund" in the memo section.

BELOW IS A STATEMENT FROM ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON:

Good evening sisters and brothers.  I say good evening because although I 
find myself in this hole and my message has to be read by my brother, 
Attorney H�ctor M. Torres, my heart is here with you.  I give my thanks to 
all of you for the support that you have given me, for your commitment with 
our people, for reclaiming the sovereignty that the government of the United 
States has usurped.

Why does the government of the United States incarcerate me again?  For 
violating some colonial conditions remnant of my slave period? Why did they 
arrest me after I had been walking the streets of our people for two (2) 
years?

The F.B.I. arrested me now for two reasons:

1. Given the announcement of a congressional commission to hold public 
hearings in Puerto Rico about the misconduct of the F.B.I. in the 
assassination of Filiberto Ojeda and the abuses committed against the press. 
  The F.B.I. arrests me to prevent me from testifying before that commission 
to give the information I received about their actions, abuses, and 
brutality against Filiberto's person.

2. Given the growth in support that the First Congress for De-colonization 
has been getting and for the positions taken by the National Council for 
De-colonization, they believed, mistakenly, that with my arrest they can 
demoralized us.  How truly mistaken they are!  They know full well that the 
Council is a breeding ground to stop their malevolent intentions to prolong 
colonialism with the inaccurately called "free association".

Sisters and brothers we are stronger and more optimistic than every while 
the imperial forces are more weak and more demoralized than ever.

Victory is on our side, and is very near.

Rene Gonzalez Writes to RHC on Station's 45th Anniversary

Havana, May 1 (RHC)-- Rene Gonzalez, one of the five Cuban political
prisoners incarcerated in the U.S. for fighting against terrorism, has
sent a letter to the workers of Radio Havana Cuba on the occasion of
the 45th anniversary of the shortwave radio station. Rene expressed
his respect for Cuba's international voice and pointed to its
importance in today�s world:


Dear comrades of Radio Havana Cuba:

In our daily efforts to break through the communications barrier,
which are not always successful, your voice enters into my cell. It is
manifested with respect and your signal is valuable.

Your message to the world expresses what Cuba means for the global
village where we live. It demonstrates what our country represents and
transforms into a spoken image through you: the ethics,
professionalism, rigor, commitment to the truth; resistance to the
cultural conquest of the planet attempting to impose lies, alienation
and ignorance.

These 45 years embracing the world, defending our principles and that
of humanity and breaking the information blockade around Cuba has been
a dignified contribution to the intellectual and ideological battle
that has turned our heroic people into a bastion of dignity and a
battle trench of a more just future.

I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart on this new
anniversary. And I'm certain that you will always be the dignified
voice of Cuba and proud to participate in the epic that has made us
compa�eros.

EVER ONWARD TO VICTORY

RENE GONZALEZ SEHEWERERT
Marianna Prison, Florida, USA

Rene Gonzalez Writes to RHC on Station's 45th Anniversary

Havana, May 1 (RHC)-- Rene Gonzalez, one of the five Cuban political
prisoners incarcerated in the U.S. for fighting against terrorism, has
sent a letter to the workers of Radio Havana Cuba on the occasion of
the 45th anniversary of the shortwave radio station. Rene expressed
his respect for Cuba's international voice and pointed to its
importance in today�s world:


Dear comrades of Radio Havana Cuba:

In our daily efforts to break through the communications barrier,
which are not always successful, your voice enters into my cell. It is
manifested with respect and your signal is valuable.

Your message to the world expresses what Cuba means for the global
village where we live. It demonstrates what our country represents and
transforms into a spoken image through you: the ethics,
professionalism, rigor, commitment to the truth; resistance to the
cultural conquest of the planet attempting to impose lies, alienation
and ignorance.

These 45 years embracing the world, defending our principles and that
of humanity and breaking the information blockade around Cuba has been
a dignified contribution to the intellectual and ideological battle
that has turned our heroic people into a bastion of dignity and a
battle trench of a more just future.

I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart on this new
anniversary. And I'm certain that you will always be the dignified
voice of Cuba and proud to participate in the epic that has made us
compa�eros.

EVER ONWARD TO VICTORY

RENE GONZALEZ SEHEWERERT
Marianna Prison, Florida, USA

yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The

ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON FREEDOM FUND!!

Antonio Camacho Negron
#03587-069
MDC Guaynabo
Metropolitan Detention Center
PO Box 2147
San Juan, Puerto Rico 00922-2147

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling for the formation of the Antonio
Camacho Negron Freedom Fund!!  Antonio has asked us not to send him money
directly, but to create a fund for his use when he is released from prison.
We are asking all freedom-loving justice-believing people to send a donation
(any amount is appreciated) to the following address:

IFCO/ProLibertad
418 W145th St.
New York, N.Y. 10031

Please endorse the check or money order to: IFCO/ProLibertad and write
"Antonio Camacho Negron Freedom Fund" in the memo section.

BELOW IS A STATEMENT FROM ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON:

Good evening sisters and brothers.  I say good evening because although I
find myself in this hole and my message has to be read by my brother,
Attorney H�ctor M. Torres, my heart is here with you.  I give my thanks to
all of you for the support that you have given me, for your commitment with
our people, for reclaiming the sovereignty that the government of the United
States has usurped.

Why does the government of the United States incarcerate me again?  For
violating some colonial conditions remnant of my slave period? Why did they
arrest me after I had been walking the streets of our people for two (2)
years?

The F.B.I. arrested me now for two reasons:

1. Given the announcement of a congressional commission to hold public
hearings in Puerto Rico about the misconduct of the F.B.I. in the
assassination of Filiberto Ojeda and the abuses committed against the press.
  The F.B.I. arrests me to prevent me from testifying before that commission
to give the information I received about their actions, abuses, and
brutality against Filiberto's person.

2. Given the growth in support that the First Congress for De-colonization
has been getting and for the positions taken by the National Council for
De-colonization, they believed, mistakenly, that with my arrest they can
demoralized us.  How truly mistaken they are!  They know full well that the
Council is a breeding ground to stop their malevolent intentions to prolong
colonialism with the inaccurately called "free association".

Sisters and brothers we are stronger and more optimistic than every while
the imperial forces are more weak and more demoralized than ever.

Victory is on our side, and is very near.

Every Boricua Machetero,
Antonio Camacho Negron

boughs and matted twigs beneath, stabbed down thin and bright before
them. But this was seldom, and it soon ceased altogether. There were
black squirrels in the wood. As Bilbos sharp inquisitive eyes got used
to seeing things he could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path
and scuttling behind tree-trunks. There were queer noises too, grunts,
scufflings, and hurryings in the undergrowth, and among the leaves that
lay piled endlessly thick in places on the forest-floor; but what made
the noises he could not see. The nastiest things they saw were the
cobwebs: dark dense cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick, often
stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in the lower branches on either
side of them. There were none stretched across the path, but whether
because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason they could
not guess.
It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as
they had hated the tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even
less hope of any ending. But they had to go on and on, long after they

his arm, and Bombur (still grumbling) was getting ready to follow, when
something bad did happen. There was a flying sound of hooves on the path
ahead. Out of the gloom came suddenly the shape of a flying deer. It
charged into the dwarves and bowled them over, then gathered itself for
a leap. High it sprang and cleared the water with a mighty jump. But it
did not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was the only one who had
kept his feet and his wits. As soon as they had landed he had bent his
bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat
appeared. Now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As
it reached the further bank it stumbled. The shadows swallowed it up,
but they heard the sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still.
Before they could shout in praise of the shot, however, a dreadful wail
from Bilbo put all thoughts of venison out of their minds. Bombur has
fallen in! Bombur is drowning! he cried. It was only too true. Bombur
had only one foot on the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang
over him. He had stumbled, thrusting the boat away from the bank, and

indeed most of them seemed to share his mind-except perhaps old fat 
Bombur and Fili and Kili. Bilbo, of course, disapproved of the whole 
turn of affairs. He had by now had more than enough of the Mountain, and
being besieged inside it was not at all to his taste. 
The whole place still stinks of dragon, he grumbled to himself, 
and it makes me sick. And cram is beginning simply to stick in my
throat.

Metropolitan Detention Center
PO Box 2147
San Juan, Puerto Rico 00922-2147

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling for the formation of the Antonio
Camacho Negron Freedom Fund!!  Antonio has asked us not to send him money
directly, but to create a fund for his use when he is released from prison.
We are asking all freedom-loving justice-believing people to send a donation
(any amount is appreciated) to the following address:

IFCO/ProLibertad
418 W145th St.
New York, N.Y. 10031

Please endorse the check or money order to: IFCO/ProLibertad and write
"Antonio Camacho Negron Freedom Fund" in the memo section.

BELOW IS A STATEMENT FROM ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON:

Good evening sisters and brothers.  I say good evening because although I
find myself in this hole and my message has to be read by my brother,
Attorney H�ctor M. Torres, my heart is here with you.  I give my thanks to
all of you for the support that you have given me, for your commitment with
our people, for reclaiming the sovereignty that the government of the United
States has usurped.

Why does the government of the United States incarcerate me again?  For
violating some colonial conditions remnant of my slave period? Why did they
arrest me after I had been walking the streets of our people for two (2)
years?

The F.B.I. arrested me now for two reasons:

1. Given the announcement of a congressional commission to hold public
hearings in Puerto Rico about the misconduct of the F.B.I. in the
assassination of Filiberto Ojeda and the abuses committed against the press.
  The F.B.I. arrests me to prevent me from testifying before that commission
to give the information I received about their actions, abuses, and
brutality against Filiberto's person.

2. Given the growth in support that the First Congress for De-colonization
has been getting and for the positions taken by the National Council for
De-colonization, they believed, mistakenly, that with my arrest they can
demoralized us.  How truly mistaken they are!  They know full well that the
Council is a breeding ground to stop their malevolent intentions to prolong
colonialism with the inaccurately called "free association".

Sisters and brothers we are stronger and more optimistic than every while
the imperial forces are more weak and more demoralized than ever.

Victory is on our side, and is very near.
April 4, 2006 Federal Correctional Facility Guaynabo, Puerto Rico
Every Boricua Machetero,
Antonio Camacho Negron

colonialism with the inaccurately called "free association".

Sisters and brothers we are stronger and more optimistic than every while
the imperial forces are more weak and more demoralized than ever.

Victory is on our side, and is very near.

Quite safe, yes, he whispered to himself. It wont see us, will

MDC Guaynabo
Metropolitan Detention Center
PO Box 2147
San Juan, Puerto Rico 00922-2147

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling for the formation of the Antonio
Camacho Negron Freedom Fund!!  Antonio has asked us not to send him money
directly, but to create a fund for his use when he is released from prison.
We are asking all freedom-loving justice-believing people to send a donation
(any amount is appreciated) to the following address:

IFCO/ProLibertad
418 W145th St.
New York, N.Y. 10031

Please endorse the check or money order to: IFCO/ProLibertad and write
"Antonio Camacho Negron Freedom Fund" in the memo section.

BELOW IS A STATEMENT FROM ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON:

Good evening sisters and brothers.  I say good evening because although I
find myself in this hole and my message has to be read by my brother,
Attorney H�ctor M. Torres, my heart is here with you.  I give my thanks to
all of you for the support that you have given me, for your commitment with
our people, for reclaiming the sovereignty that the government of the United
States has usurped.

Why does the government of the United States incarcerate me again?  For
violating some colonial conditions remnant of my slave period? Why did they
arrest me after I had been walking the streets of our people for two (2)
years?

The F.B.I. arrested me now for two reasons:

1. Given the announcement of a congressional commission to hold public
hearings in Puerto Rico about the misconduct of the F.B.I. in the
assassination of Filiberto Ojeda and the abuses committed against the press.
  The F.B.I. arrests me to prevent me from testifying before that commission
to give the information I received about their actions, abuses, and
brutality against Filiberto's person.

2. Given the growth in support that the First Congress for De-colonization
has been getting and for the positions taken by the National Council for
De-colonization, they believed, mistakenly, that with my arrest they can
demoralized us.  How truly mistaken they are!  They know full well that the
Council is a breeding ground to stop their malevolent intentions to prolong
colonialism with the inaccurately called "free association".

Sisters and brothers we are stronger and more optimistic than every while
the imperial forces are more weak and more demoralized than ever.

Victory is on our side, and is very near.

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling for the formation of the Antonio
Camacho Negron Freedom Fund!!  Antonio has asked us not to send him money
directly, but to create a fund for his use when he is released from prison.
We are asking all freedom-loving justice-believing people to send a donation
(any amount is appreciated) to the following address:

IFCO/ProLibertad
418 W145th St.
New York, N.Y. 10031

Please endorse the check or money order to: IFCO/ProLibertad and write
"Antonio Camacho Negron Freedom Fund" in the memo section.

BELOW IS A STATEMENT FROM ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON:

Good evening sisters and brothers.  I say good evening because although I
find myself in this hole and my message has to be read by my brother,
Attorney H�ctor M. Torres, my heart is here with you.  I give my thanks to
all of you for the support that you have given me, for your commitment with
our people, for reclaiming the sovereignty that the government of the United
States has usurped.

Why does the government of the United States incarcerate me again?  For
violating some colonial conditions remnant of my slave period? Why did they
arrest me after I had been walking the streets of our people for two (2)
years?

The F.B.I. arrested me now for two reasons:

1. Given the announcement of a congressional commission to hold public
hearings in Puerto Rico about the misconduct of the F.B.I. in the
assassination of Filiberto Ojeda and the abuses committed against the press.
  The F.B.I. arrests me to prevent me from testifying before that commission
to give the information I received about their actions, abuses, and
brutality against Filiberto's person.

2. Given the growth in support that the First Congress for De-colonization
has been getting and for the positions taken by the National Council for
De-colonization, they believed, mistakenly, that with my arrest they can
demoralized us.  How truly mistaken they are!  They know full well that the
Council is a breeding ground to stop their malevolent intentions to prolong
colonialism with the inaccurately called "free association".

Sisters and brothers we are stronger and more optimistic than every while
the imperial forces are more weak and more demoralized than ever.

Victory is on our side, and is very near.
April 4, 2006 Federal Correctional Facility Guaynabo, Puerto Rico
Every Boricua Machetero,
Antonio Camacho Negron

Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking, said
Bombur, when what we wanted was fire and food!

Your troubles seem larger the longer you look at them There is more than one way to skin a cat Old friends and wine are best  Live and let live All roads lead to Rome Familiarity breeds contempt Love is blind 

Due to the presence of fools, wise people stand out  Modulation in all things.
A user and his leisure time are soon parted. Diligence is the mother of good fortune A new broom sweeps clean. A best friend is like a four leaf clover, Hard to find and lucky to have.
 Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth  Poor men seek meat for their stomach, rich men stomach for their meat. Out of sight, out of mind Modulation in all things. Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain and most fools do When It Rains and the Sun Shines at the Same Time the Devil is Beating his Wife Contrary breeze ah mek crow and eagle light on one line. A bad custom is like a good cake, better broken than kept.

Is the silence broken?

For the first time since the Cuban Five were imprisoned in the United States 
eight years ago, a major U.S. newspaper makes an analysis of the case. On 
its front page and in two columns, the Washington Post publishes a story 
that you can read in its entirety on our website. The story comes with an 
attached slide show of images of Havana, narrated by the author of the 
story, Manuel Roig-Franzia.

Cubans Jailed in U.S. as Spies Are Hailed at Home as Heroes
By Manuel Roig-Franzia
Washington Post Foreign Service
Saturday, June 3, 2006; Page A01

HAVANA -- European tourists here send home postcards with stamps bearing the 
images of five faces, known simply as los muchachos (the young men) or los 
cinco (the five). The faces, usually surrounded by billowing Cuban flags, 
stare out, larger than life, from factory walls, apartment buildings, bill 
boards.

The five are heroes in Cuba, but villains to exiles in the United States, 
where they are serving long prison terms for espionage-related convictions 
in 2001.

Their case, once cheekily cast in the Miami news media as a "spy-vs.-spy," 
Cold War-era throwback, illuminates the resilience of the complicated, 
decades-long standoff entangling Cuba, the U.S. government and Cuban exile 
groups based in Florida. It is now also raising nettlesome questions about 
the nuances of terrorism and international espionage.

American officials tend to paint Cuban agents as infiltrators bent on 
undermining U.S. national security. But the Cuban government asserts they 
are men of courage, sent to the United States to ferret out terrorism plots 
by Cuban exile groups waging war against President Fidel Castro.

Since the Cuban Five were convicted, the reach of Havana's 
information-gathering machine -- described by a former CIA Cuba analyst, 
Brian Latell, as "among the four or five best anywhere in the world" -- has 
become even more apparent. In 2002, Ana Belen Montes, a senior analyst on 
Cuban affairs for the Defense Intelligence Agency in Washington, was 
convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Cubans; the year before, 
a high-ranking U.S. immigration official in Miami was convicted of 
disclosing classified information to Cuba. In January, a longtime professor 
at Florida International University and his wife, a mental health counselor 
at the college, pleaded not guilty to charges that they acted as spies for 
Castro.

But none of those cases has generated as much debate as that of the Cuban 
Five. There has been a groundswell of support for the five acknowledged 
agents among some American liberal groups and celebrities, including Alice 
Walker, author of "The Color Purple," actor Danny Glover and author Noam 
Chomsky. A San Francisco group maintains a Web site called "National 
Committee to Free the Cuban Five." The Detroit City Council even passed a 
resolution in March calling for their release, saying the agents were 
attempting to prevent terrorism against Cuba.

The calls for their release gained momentum last August when a three-judge 
panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, 
overturned the convictions and ordered a new trial, because of a "perfect 
storm" of bias in the Cuban exile bastion of Miami. The decision is now 
being reviewed by the full court.

In a recent interview, Ricardo Alarcon -- president of Cuba's National 
Assembly and the third-most-powerful political figure on the island after 
Castro and his brother, Raul -- described the work of secret agents as the 
right of a sovereign nation to defend itself. He called Cuba an object of 
terrorism, a nation under threat of violence.

Alarcon said hundreds of Cuban citizens have been killed in terrorist 
attacks since Castro came to power in 1959 and recalled banners saying "Iraq 
now, Cuba later" at demonstrations in Miami before the U.S.-led invasion of 
Iraq in 2003.

Asked whether Cuba would continue to send agents to the United States, 
Alarcon shifted from Spanish to English and said emphatically: "Yes, with a 
capital Y."

The Wasp Network

Jos� Basulto, founder of an anti-Castro group in Miami, remembers a young 
man named Ruben Campa hanging around the airport where Basulto kept his 
planes in the mid-1990s. The planes were being used to save Cuban refugees 
stranded in the ocean between Florida and Cuba, and to drop anti-Castro 
leaflets in Havana, a tactic that infuriated the Cuban government.

Campa was quick to make friends and "eager to jump on the bandwagon," 
Basulto recalled, and soon he was flying missions for the group, Brothers to 
the Rescue.

After the spies were arrested in September 1998, Basulto said he learned 
that Ruben Campa was an alias borrowed from a dead Texas boy and that his 
recruit's real name was Rene Gonzalez. Gonzalez and nine others were 
arrested and accused of running "La Red Avispa" -- the Wasp Network -- which 
prosecutors said was spying on U.S. military bases and Cuban exile groups.

Indictments were eventually handed up against four others, bringing the 
total to 14 and making the prosecution one of the largest multiple-defendant 
spying cases in U.S. history. Also, three months after the initial arrests, 
three Cuban diplomats at the United Nations were expelled for alleged 
involvement with the Miami spy network.

Five of those accused pleaded guilty. Four others have remained fugitives, 
but Gonzalez and the others in the Cuban Five -- Gerardo Hernandez, Antonio 
Guerrero, Ramon Laba�ino and Fernando Gonzalez (no relation to Rene 
Gonzalez) -- have fought the charges.

The years before the arrests had been particularly tense.

In 1997, there was a series of terrorist bombings in Havana hotels. One 
Italian tourist was killed. The Cuban government suspected Miami exile 
groups of being involved in the attacks in an attempt to undermine Cuba's 
burgeoning tourist industry. At the time, the Cuban government saw Basulto, 
a CIA-trained operative, as a threat. In 1961, he had fired a cannon from a 
boat off Havana and hit a hotel.

Alarcon said that in the summer of 1998, Cuban intelligence officials 
delivered a packet of documents outlining their concerns to FBI agents at a 
meeting in Havana. Not long afterward, the Wasp Network arrests were 
announced in Miami. Alarcon was apoplectic.

"They shot the messenger," Alarcon recalled thinking at the time, arguing 
that the U.S. had double-crossed Cuba.

Guy Lewis, a former U.S. attorney who oversaw the Cuban Five prosecution, 
said in an interview that one of the agents worked as a mechanic at Naval 
Air Station Key West and another counted planes from his apartment near 
MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, where overseas military operations were 
coordinated.

"It's clear," Lewis said, "that Cuba's intelligence service maintains a 
contingency of very well-trained, organized and financed agents."

Trial in Miami

While the Cuban Five awaited trial, Miami's exiles were in an uproar about 
Elian Gonzalez, a 6-year-old boy found off Florida's coast after the boat 
that carried him from Cuba capsized, killing his mother and 10 other 
refugees.

Seven months after Gonzalez was returned to his father in Cuba, jury 
selection began in Miami for the Cuban Five trial over the objections of 
defense attorneys who argued that a fair trial would be impossible so soon 
after the Gonzalez case had inflamed a city full of anti-Castro exiles.

Jurors listened to testimony for six months about encrypted messages sent to 
Cuba and code names. The defense argued that the accused should be freed 
because they collected no classified data and did not get into off-limits 
areas of military bases. Prosecutors countered that it was their failure to 
register as foreign agents and their intent to collect sensitive information 
that warranted convictions.

The jury -- which included no Cuban Americans -- convicted all five. 
Hernandez was sentenced to life in prison on a murder conspiracy charge for 
tipping off Rene Gonzalez and another Cuban spy not to fly with Brothers to 
the Rescue on the day the Cuban military shot down two of the group's planes 
in 1996, killing four of its members.

The state-run daily in Havana, Granma, responded with a front-page editorial 
headlined: "A Heroic Behavior in the Entrails of the Monster."

'Hypocrites'

One recent afternoon, in a neighborhood behind the chipped and faded Jose 
Marti sports complex in central Havana, Antonio Lag� stepped over children 
playing beneath an apartment bulletin board that, like so many in Havana, 
carries a photo of the Cuban Five. "Hypocrites, that's what Bush and the 
Americans are -- hypocrites," he said. "They talk about fighting terrorism, 
but they keep these heroes in prison for trying to stop the terrorists in 
Miami."

Leonard Weinglass, a renowned U.S. defense lawyer, has taken up Hernandez's 
appeal after a career that includes representing members of the Chicago 
Seven antiwar demonstrators at the Democratic Party convention in Chicago in 
1968, and former Black Panther and death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal.

Weinglass persuaded the appeals court panel that the accused spies could not 
get a fair trial in Miami. Now his strategy is to concede that there was a 
technical violation of the law but argue that the actions of his client were 
necessary to protect lives.

"If they are under attack, does a country have the right to send agents to 
another country to get information?" Weinglass said, while sipping a mojito 
on the patio of the storied Hotel Nacional de Cuba. "That is a major 
intelligence question."

Weinglass and the wives and mothers of several imprisoned agents picked up 
more allies during a speech to a California legal group in Havana, among 
them 16-year Democratic congressman Esteban E. Torres.

"It's a real miscarriage of justice," Torres said. "It tells us something 
about our government and the judiciary and the intelligence service: 
Anything that they can do to get Fidel, they'll do."

Though Castro has never been connected to the case, U.S. intelligence 
experts say they believe the Cuban leader personally oversees high-priority 
spying missions.

"And he's good," said Latell, author of the book "After Fidel." "He's 
really, really good."

Alarcon said more agents would be sent to the United States, even though 
Cuba experts contend the threat from exiles -- whether perceived or real -- 
is diminishing.

Alarcon points out that John D. Negroponte, President Bush's director of 
national intelligence, recently said the United States had more than 100,000 
intelligence personnel.

Cuba does not have that many intelligence personnel, Alarcon said, but it 
has more agents than the five celebrated officers now in prison. The real 
number, he said, "is somewhere in between."

Greetings Friends &amp; Comrades                     6/8/06

To Friends of the Puerto Rican Independence Struggle:

Puerto Rican political prisoner Antonio Camacho Negr�n, who was arrested
on March 27, after the first day of a national congress for the
decolonization of Puerto Rico, has been transferred to a prison in the
United States. Antonio Camacho Negr�n, the national organizer of the
congress which was held in various locations in the island during the week
of March 27 to 29, has serious gastrointestinal problems.

According to the message sent by Ram�n Nenadich, the president of the
Consejo Nacional para la Descolonizaci�n (CONADE), Antonio has been placed
in a high security area with a mentally ill prisoner who does not allow
him to sleep at night. Antonio is not getting the medicines he needs for
his gastritis; instead he is being given Prozac. Because of this he cannot
eat and is continously vomiting.

We call on all our friends who can write and/or call the prison
authorities, to do so and ask, request or demand that he is given his
medication and that he is released unconditionally. Antonio has done more
prison time than required by federal statutes. We need to stop the abuse!

In solidarity,

Graciano Matos

1. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Vendor will grant to the Company the sole and exclusive irrevocable right and title to the
Claims, subject to:

(i) the completion by the Company of confirmation of legal title and due diligence on the Properties as to ownership by the Vendor and results therefrom being satisfactory to the
Company, acting reasonably, within a period of 90 days;

(ii) the right to extend a further 90 days by mutual consent. (the right to extend a further 90 days has been granted to the Company, in an effort to complete its due diligence);

(iii) The Vendor and the Company shall put forth, all their reasonable best efforts to obtain a satisfactory title opinion or Court Order, or such that the Company will acquire the property freee and clear of all liens and encumbrances, with a view to further develop the property into an operating mine.

2. Upon satisfactory completion of the due diligence and clear title being established, the Company will then:

(a) issue to the Vendor Twenty Million (20,000,000) Common Shares, upon the execution by the parties of this Agreement and subject to the subject conditions as set out above; and 
(b) that all original documents or notarized copies of official translations are therefore required to complete the transactions contemplated in the Agreement.

authorities to place the property into production. Upon the appropriate permits being approved, the Purchaser will have the option to acquire an additional 25% interest in the property (bringing the Purchaser interest to 75%) in exchange for a further issuance of Ten Million (10,000,000) Common shares of the Company's stock.

As you make your bed, so must you lie in it Better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting, with strife A cold bitter Christmas, a fat churchyard. Marry in haste, and repent at leisure The more one knows, the less one believes Justice delayed is justice denied. Life is just a bowl of cherries. He who hesitates is lost Friends are made by many acts - and lost by only one  No good carpenter does get good wuk bench.

Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity  Keep your chin up Eat well, stay fit, die anyway Every Cook Praises His Own Broth If you believe everything you read, you better not read If yuh plant plantain yuh can't reap cassava. Look good, feel good The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. Better safe than sorry For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

Exigency is the matriarch of ingenious contrivance. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Fools rush in where angels fear to tread A reed before the wind lives on, while might oaks do fall. Dead men tell no tales Grease is the only cure for a hangover It takes all sorts to make a world A fair exchange is no robbery. Too many cooks spoil the broth

Better to be lowly in spirit and among the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud The more one knows, the less one believes We never know the worth of water till the well is dry  Cold hands, warm heart  Keep your mouth shut and your ears open. The Moon does not heed the barking of dogs  Smile and the world smiles with you, snore and you sleep alone A lie well stuck to is as good as the truth.

EMERGENCY PICKET FOR ANTONIO CAMACHO NEGRON
THURSDAY JUNE 28TH, 2006 AT 5PM
FEDERAL BUILDING 26 FEDERAL PLAZA

Antonio Camacho Negr�n has been moved again!

His condition is very serious, as the prison authorities were forcing him
to take Prozac in Atlanta and refusing to give him his medication for his
gastritis. Antonio has been vomiting almost constantly as a result of
this. (One of the side effects of Prozac is nausea.) Antonio was also
sharing a cell with a schizophrenic, making it very difficult for him to
relax and sleep.

We need people to write, email, call and fax the prison immediately. The
situation is urgent! Demand that Antonio be given his gastritis
medication, that he stop being forced to take Prozac, and that he be in
general population. He should also be allowed to make phone calls and
receive visits from his attorney.

JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL CALL FOR JUSTICE FOR THE CUBAN 5 AND THEIR FAMILIES
SEPTEMBER 12 � OCTOBER 6, 2006

Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero and
Rene Gonzalez, have been unjustly imprisoned in U.S. federal penitentiaries
since the fall of 1998.  Their crime?  Fighting terrorism.

Since 1998 their imprisonment has been determined to be arbitrary and
illegal by a unanimous decision of a five member panel of U.N. human rights
experts. Their convictions were reversed by a unanimous decision of three
judges of the Atlanta Court of Appeals. Those decisions were announced in
May 2005 and August 2005, but the Five Cubans are still in prison subjected
to cruel and unusual treatment with severe violations of their human rights,
including the denial of visas to the wives of Gerardo and Rene.

Three federal judges for 16 months examined the prejudicial and illegal
practices that characterized their trial in Miami. In their 93 page decision
they concluded unanimously that Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon
Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero and Rene Gonzalez were victims of an
unprecedented bias, which denied them their fundamental right to a fair
trial. Their ruling set aside each and every one of their convictions. It
was a great victory, but not one that Washington and its friends in Miami
could accept. Such a powerful statement by one of the highest - if not the
most conservative - courts in the United States outraged those ordinarily
unchallenged makers of Cuban policy and compelled them, in desperation, to
resort to a rarely used legal tactic to appeal the decision.

We are now awaiting word on whether or not the federal appellate court in
Atlanta will hold firm to its' initial determination.

Two months ago, Ricardo Alarcon, the President of the Cuban Parliament,
urged that a period starting September 12th and ending October 6th be used
to break down the silence surrounding the case of the Cuban Five as well as
to condemn all terrorism and demand justice for its victims.

Whether it was sending medical brigades, sending scientific experts, or
training future physicians, Cuba has always responded to the needs of the
international community.  Now, it is our turn to stand in support of Cuba
and its call to Free the Cuban 5.

We call upon all of you to join in the international campaign against US
sponsored terrorism from September 12 to October the 6, 2006, by:

� Endorsing this call for a period of activities from September 12th to
October 6th of this year to educate and rally public support for the freedom

FREE THE CUBAN FIVE!
SOLIDARITY WITH CUBA!
STOP THE US ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WAR!
FREEDOM TO TRAVEL TO CUBA!


On July 26, 1953 a small group of young revolutionary fighters, led by Fidel 
Castro, attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago, Cuba, a garrison of the 
US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Although defeated on that day, 
history has registered that the Moncada assault soon became a determined 
guerrilla army and a mighty mass movement that culminated in the triumph of 
the Cuban Revolution on January 1, 1959. Over the past 47 years it is also 
clear the Cuban Revolution has become one of the most historic, inspiring, 
and powerful political events of modern times. For these reasons, the island 
and its revolutionary leadership has been targeted for destruction by 
successive Republican and Democratic Administrations in Washington to this 
day. More than ever, as a new wave of popular resistance and struggle 
against imperialist domination for the rights of workers, peasants, and 
indigenous people sweeps the Americas, the example of Cuba is unacceptable 
and intolerable to the powers that be in Washington, DC. We say, in 
response, that Washington�s economic and political war against Cuba is 
unacceptable to us and we will fight it by any means necessary and possible.

July 26 is a national holiday in Cuba. Every year in New York City, 
defenders of the Cuban Revolution come together to celebrate the origin, 
continued example and resonance of the Revolution on or around July 26th. 
This year�s celebration will be on Saturday, July 29.  We are currently in 
the process of securing a location that is convenient  and large enough for 
the many hundreds of people that are attracted to this event. The July 26 
Coalition has been established for the past four years to organize this 
annual event. We will be meeting every Wednesday until the event at the 
1199/SEIU Building, 310 West 43rd Street, between 8th and 9th Avenues (Times 
Square Subway Stop) in Manhattan at 6:30 PM. We urge you or your 
organization to endorse the July 29 event and attend these meetings.

The celebration this year will have as a central theme, the solidarity of 
Cuba with Latin America and the solidarity of Latin America with Cuba. In 
particular, the growing alliance of revolutionary Cuba with Bolivarian 
Venezuela, and now Bolivia since the stunning election of Evo Morales as 
President in December 2005, and the start of vital social, economic, and 
political transformations in those Latin American states. The July 29 event 
will feature addresses by top diplomatic representatives from Venezuela and 
Bolivia and a keynote speech by an ambassador of Cuba to the United Nations. 
In addition, there will be a speaker that ties the exploding movement for 
immigrant workers rights in the United States and other growing labor and 
other progressive battles here with the Cuban Revolution and the people�s 
struggles sweeping the Americas. There will also be musical and other 
cultural performances, a catered meal, and a guaranteed enlightening, 
inspiring, good time for all.

Save July 29th on your calendar! Details on venue, time, and program will be 
forthcoming soon.

On July 26, 1953 a small group of young revolutionary fighters, led by Fidel
Castro, attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago, Cuba, a garrison of the
US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Although defeated on that day,
history has registered that the Moncada assault soon became a determined
guerrilla army and a mighty mass movement that culminated in the triumph of
the Cuban Revolution on January 1, 1959. Over the past 47 years it is also
clear the Cuban Revolution has become one of the most historic, inspiring,
and powerful political events of modern times. For these reasons, the island
and its revolutionary leadership has been targeted for destruction by
successive Republican and Democratic Administrations in Washington to this
day. More than ever, as a new wave of popular resistance and struggle
against imperialist domination for the rights of workers, peasants, and
indigenous people sweeps the Americas, the example of Cuba is unacceptable
and intolerable to the powers that be in Washington, DC. We say, in
response, that Washington's economic and political war against Cuba is
unacceptable to us and we will fight it by any means necessary and possible.

July 26 is a national holiday in Cuba. Every year in New York City,
defenders of the Cuban Revolution come together to celebrate the origin,
continued example and resonance of the Revolution on or around July 26th.
This year's celebration will be on Saturday, July 29.  We are currently in
the process of securing a location that is convenient  and large enough for
the many hundreds of people that are attracted to this event. The July 26
Coalition has been established for the past four years to organize this
annual event. We will be meeting every Wednesday until the event at the
1199/SEIU Building, 310 West 43rd Street, between 8th and 9th Avenues (Times
Square Subway Stop) in Manhattan at 6:30 PM. We urge you or your
organization to endorse the July 29 event and attend these meetings.

The celebration this year will have as a central theme, the solidarity of
Cuba with Latin America and the solidarity of Latin America with Cuba. In
particular, the growing alliance of revolutionary Cuba with Bolivarian
Venezuela, and now Bolivia since the stunning election of Evo Morales as
President in December 2005, and the start of vital social, economic, and
political transformations in those Latin American states. The July 29 event
will feature addresses by top diplomatic representatives from Venezuela and
Bolivia and a keynote speech by an ambassador of Cuba to the United Nations.
In addition, there will be a speaker that ties the exploding movement for
immigrant workers rights in the United States and other growing labor and
other progressive battles here with the Cuban Revolution and the people's
struggles sweeping the Americas. There will also be musical and other
cultural performances, a catered meal, and a guaranteed enlightening,
inspiring, good time for all.

Save July 29th on your calendar! Details on venue, time, and program will be
forthcoming soon.

JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL CALL FOR JUSTICE FOR THE CUBAN 5 AND THEIR FAMILIES 
SEPTEMBER 12 � OCTOBER 6, 2006

Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero and
Rene Gonzalez, have been unjustly imprisoned in U.S. federal penitentiaries
since the fall of 1998.  Their crime?  Fighting terrorism.

Since 1998 their imprisonment has been determined to be arbitrary and
illegal by a unanimous decision of a five member panel of U.N. human rights
experts. Their convictions were reversed by a unanimous decision of three
judges of the Atlanta Court of Appeals. Those decisions were announced in
May 2005 and August 2005, but the Five Cubans are still in prison subjected
to cruel and unusual treatment with severe violations of their human rights,
including the denial of visas to the wives of Gerardo and Rene.

Three federal judges for 16 months examined the prejudicial and illegal
practices that characterized their trial in Miami. In their 93 page decision
they concluded unanimously that Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon
Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero and Rene Gonzalez were victims of an
unprecedented bias, which denied them their fundamental right to a fair
trial. Their ruling set aside each and every one of their convictions. It
was a great victory, but not one that Washington and its friends in Miami
could accept. Such a powerful statement by one of the highest - if not the
most conservative - courts in the United States outraged those ordinarily
unchallenged makers of Cuban policy and compelled them, in desperation, to
resort to a rarely used legal tactic to appeal the decision.

We are now awaiting word on whether or not the federal appellate court in
Atlanta will hold firm to its' initial determination.

Two months ago, Ricardo Alarcon, the President of the Cuban Parliament,
urged that a period starting September 12th and ending October 6th be used
to break down the silence surrounding the case of the Cuban Five as well as
to condemn all terrorism and demand justice for its victims.

Whether it was sending medical brigades, sending scientific experts, or
training future physicians, Cuba has always responded to the needs of the
international community.  Now, it is our turn to stand in support of Cuba
and its call to Free the Cuban 5.

We call upon all of you to join in the international campaign against US
sponsored terrorism from September 12 to October the 6, 2006, by:

� Endorsing this call for a period of activities from September 12th to
October 6th of this year to educate and rally public support for the freedom
of Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero
and Rene Gonzalez and to demand that their families be allowed to visit
them; ADD YOUR ORGANIZATION TO THE LIST BELOW!!

� Discuss scheduling an event in your church, school, political
organization, solidarity group, or community organization during The Free
the Five Month; we need to fill this 25 day period with activitres
throughout NYC and throughout the United States.

� Contact The Free the Cuban 5 Organizing Committee for resources, which can
help to organize your event and to coordinate with others building the
Freedom Calendar for the 5.

Please send your endorsement to: FreetheCubanfive@... and circulate
this call widely.  PLEASE LET US KNOW WHEN YOU CAN SCHEDULE YOUR EVENT
BETWEEN SEPT. 12TH-OCT. 6TH, 2006.

&gt;The Cuban Five Remain Locked Up in US Prisons
&gt;A Mockery of Justice
&gt;By ANDR�S G�MEZ
&gt;
&gt;Last May 27 marked one year since a United Nations Human Rights
&gt;Commission Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions ruled that the
&gt;imprisonment of five Cubans, Gerardo Hern�ndez, Ram�n Laba�ino,
&gt;Antonio Guerrero, Fernando Gonz�lez and Ren� Gonz�lez, was arbitrary
&gt;and contravened Article 14 of the International Convention for Civil
&gt;and Political Rights. The Group urged the U.S. government to adopt
&gt;measures necessary to seek a solution to the situation.
&gt;
&gt;One of the special mechanisms by which the U.N. Human Rights
&gt;Commission works, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions was
&gt;established in May of 2005 and comprises experts from Spain, Hungary
&gt;, Iran, Paraguay and Algeria. Thus, three of the experts came from
&gt;countries whose governments are U.S. allies.
&gt;
&gt;The Group adopted the measure in response to a petition that the
&gt;families of the five men made personally in Geneva in 2003, after
&gt;evaluating arguments brought by both relatives and the U.S.
&gt;government.
&gt;
&gt;The U.S. government rejected the Working Group's opinion, once again
&gt;making a mockery of justice in its application in the case of the
&gt;Cuban Five.
&gt;
&gt;The men have now been unjustly incarcerated for eight years after an
&gt;arrest and trial that were based on false accusations.
&gt;
&gt;It's now been more than 10 months since a three-judge panel of the
&gt;Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously to reverse the
&gt;sentences of the Five and ordered a new trial, but they remain in
&gt;prison.
&gt;
&gt;Using a complicated appeals process that is nothing short of
&gt;derisory, the five innocent men remain behind bars under arduous
&gt;conditions.
&gt;
&gt;The decision by the Working Group is extremely important because it
&gt;is the accepted mechanism by which member states of the United
&gt;Nations evaluate criteria on aspects of international law in relation
&gt;to such cases.
&gt;
&gt;Upon what was the U.N. group's decision based? The following is
&gt;quoted from its opinion relating to the Five:
&gt;
&gt;"Following their arrest, and notwithstanding the fact that the
&gt;detainees had been informed of their right to remain silent and had
&gt;their defense provided by the Government, they were kept in solitary
&gt;confinement for 17 months, during which communication with their
&gt;attorneys, and access to evidence and thus, possibilities to a
&gt;adequate defense were weakened, ...
&gt;
&gt;"As the case was classified as one of national security, access by
&gt;the detainees to the documents that contained evidence was impaired.
&gt;The Government has not contested the fact that defense lawyers had
&gt;very limited access to evidence because of this classification,
&gt;negatively affecting their ability to present counter evidence ...
&gt;
&gt;" the Government has not denied that even so, the climate of bias and
&gt;prejudice against the accused in Miami persisted and helped to
&gt;present the accused as guilty from the beginning. It was not
&gt;contested by the Government that one year later it admitted that
&gt;Miami was an unsuitable place for a trial where it proved almost
&gt;impossible to select an impartial jury in a case linked with Cuba.
&gt;
&gt;"The Working Group notes that it arises from the facts and
&gt;circumstances in which the trial took place and from the nature of
&gt;the charges and the harsh sentences given to the accused, that the
&gt;trial did not take place in the climate of objectivity and
&gt;impartiality which is required in order to conclude on the observance
&gt;of the standards of a fair trial, as defined in Article 14 of the
&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the
&gt;United States of America is a party.
&gt;
&gt;"The Working Group concludes that the three elements that were
&gt;enunciated above, combined together, are of such gravity that they
&gt;confer the deprivation of liberty of these five persons an arbitrary
&gt;character.
&gt;
&gt;" the Working Group requests the Government to adopt the necessary
&gt;steps to remedy the situation, in conformity with the principles
&gt;stated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
&gt;
&gt;This opinion agrees with and confirms the essential arguments of the
&gt;Cuban Five defense team and the decision of the Eleventh Circuit
&gt;Court of Appeals that in August reversed their sentences and annulled
&gt;their trial.
&gt;
&gt;We all know the response of the United States government before this
&gt;distressing proof of iniquity, which clearly demonstrates its utter
&gt;lack of respect for law and justice.

JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL CALL FOR JUSTICE FOR THE CUBAN 5 AND THEIR FAMILIES
SEPTEMBER 12 � OCTOBER 6, 2006

Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero and
Rene Gonzalez, have been unjustly imprisoned in U.S. federal penitentiaries
since the fall of 1998.  Their crime?  Fighting terrorism.

Since 1998 their imprisonment has been determined to be arbitrary and
illegal by a unanimous decision of a five member panel of U.N. human rights
experts. Their convictions were reversed by a unanimous decision of three
judges of the Atlanta Court of Appeals. Those decisions were announced in
May 2005 and August 2005, but the Five Cubans are still in prison subjected
to cruel and unusual treatment with severe violations of their human rights,
including the denial of visas to the wives of Gerardo and Rene.

Three federal judges for 16 months examined the prejudicial and illegal
practices that characterized their trial in Miami. In their 93 page decision
they concluded unanimously that Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon
Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero and Rene Gonzalez were victims of an
unprecedented bias, which denied them their fundamental right to a fair
trial. Their ruling set aside each and every one of their convictions. It
was a great victory, but not one that Washington and its friends in Miami
could accept. Such a powerful statement by one of the highest - if not the
most conservative - courts in the United States outraged those ordinarily
unchallenged makers of Cuban policy and compelled them, in desperation, to
resort to a rarely used legal tactic to appeal the decision.

We are now awaiting word on whether or not the federal appellate court in
Atlanta will hold firm to its' initial determination.

Two months ago, Ricardo Alarcon, the President of the Cuban Parliament,
urged that a period starting September 12th and ending October 6th be used
to break down the silence surrounding the case of the Cuban Five as well as
to condemn all terrorism and demand justice for its victims.

Whether it was sending medical brigades, sending scientific experts, or
training future physicians, Cuba has always responded to the needs of the
international community.  Now, it is our turn to stand in support of Cuba
and its call to Free the Cuban 5.

We call upon all of you to join in the international campaign against US
sponsored terrorism from September 12 to October the 6, 2006, by:

� Endorsing this call for a period of activities from September 12th to
October 6th of this year to educate and rally public support for the freedom
of Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero
and Rene Gonzalez and to demand that their families be allowed to visit
them; ADD YOUR ORGANIZATION TO THE LIST BELOW!!

� Discuss scheduling an event in your church, school, political
organization, solidarity group, or community organization during The Free
the Five Month; we need to fill this 25 day period with activitres
throughout NYC and throughout the United States.

CHINA GOLD CORP
Symbol: CGDC
Current Price: 0.25

A Company engaged in gold and minerals exploration and development of 
gold and mineral properties in China. 

Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC)? Seee n0wadays what happened.

� Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The 
price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only 
a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for 
inflation.)

� HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already 
been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps 
climbing.

� China is the world�s last great under-explored land-mass - Locked 
away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China�s 
rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.

� China is already the world�s 4th largest producer of gold � and will 
soon be the world�s #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going 
gold-crazy!

� Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been 
changed to provide full legal protection.

You can see China�s developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare 
0pp0rtunity for early investors!!

<pre>Genuine Swiss made Rolex replicas are as close to the real thing 
as a replica watch can be. Sometimes even the professional jewelers 
are unable to tell the difference from the real Rolex watch.  
All genuine Swiss Rolex Replicas should have the following:- Full 1-year 
Warranty 
  - Solid 14k or 18k Gold on two-toned models
  - Guaranteed triple-wrapped gold on all-gold models 
  - Genuine sapphire crystal - a type of glass that is many times better 

  at resisting scratches than regular glass.
  - The color of the gold looks exactly like a genuine Rolex watch If 
the retailer does not offer this, do not purchase from them!//e have all 
this! JUST 
  COME and buy your REPLICA //atches!

To the Movement in support of Justice and Freedom,

Endorsers list a tthe bootm of the Call!!

Please send your endorsement to: FreetheCubanfive@... and circulate
this call widely. PLEASE LET US KNOW WHEN YOU CAN SCHEDULE YOUR EVENT
BETWEEN SEPT. 12TH-OCT. 6TH, 2006.

JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL CALL FOR JUSTICE FOR THE CUBAN 5 AND THEIR FAMILIES
SEPTEMBER 12 � OCTOBER 6, 2006

Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero and
Rene Gonzalez, have been unjustly imprisoned in U.S. federal penitentiaries
since the fall of 1998. Their crime? Fighting terrorism.

Since 1998 their imprisonment has been determined to be arbitrary and
illegal by a unanimous decision of a five member panel of U.N. human rights
experts. Their convictions were reversed by a unanimous decision of three
judges of the Atlanta Court of Appeals. Those decisions were announced in
May 2005 and August 2005, but the Five Cubans are still in prison subjected
to cruel and unusual treatment with severe violations of their human rights,
including the denial of visas to the wives of Gerardo and Rene.

Three federal judges for 16 months examined the prejudicial and illegal
practices that characterized their trial in Miami. In their 93 page decision
they concluded unanimously that Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon
Laba�ino, Antonio Guerrero and Rene Gonzalez were victims of an
unprecedented bias, which denied them their fundamental right to a fair
trial. Their ruling set aside each and every one of their convictions. It
was a great victory, but not one that Washington and its friends in Miami
could accept. Such a powerful statement by one of the highest - if not the
most conservative - courts in the United States outraged those ordinarily
unchallenged makers of Cuban policy and compelled them, in desperation, to
resort to a rarely used legal tactic to appeal the decision.

We are now awaiting word on whether or not the federal appellate court in
Atlanta will hold firm to its' initial determination.

Two months ago, Ricardo Alarcon, the President of the Cuban Parliament,
urged that a period starting September 12th and ending October 6th be used
to break down the silence surrounding the case of the Cuban Five as well as
to condemn all terrorism and demand justice for its victims.

Whether it was sending medical brigades, sending scientific experts, or
training future physicians, Cuba has always responded to the needs of the
international community. Now, it is our turn to stand in support of Cuba
and its call to Free the Cuban 5.

We call upon all of you to join in the international campaign against US
sponsored terrorism from September 12 to October the 6, 2006, by:

� Endorsing this call for a period of activities from September 12th to
October 6th of this year to educate and rally public support for the freedom

Take your time and time will take you  There is no jollity but hath a smack of folly None but the wearer knows where the shoe pinches
The pen is mightier than the sword. Old sins cast long shadows  Time is a great healer Folly grows without watering All good things come to those who wait. A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness.

Wherever you may be let your wind go free You can have too much of a good thing

The following article was sent out by the International Concened Family and 
Freinds of Mumia Abu Jamal and MOVE; ProLibertad thanks both organizations 
for their amazing solidarity and support on Saturday August 5th!! LONG LIVE 
JOHN AFRICA!!  FREE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS!!

Please check out the pictures of August 5th:
http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page21.html

On August 5, 2006 activists converged on Philadelphia to show their 
unyielding support for the MOVE 9, incarcerated Puerto Rican 
independentista, Antonio Camacho Negron, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Leonard Peltier, 
Russell "Maroon" Shoatz, and all political prisoners.
August 8th, 2006 is the twenty-eighth anniversary of the siege on MOVE 
headquarters, which resulted in the unjust incarceration of innocent MOVE 
members. Today, they are still locked down in Pennsylvania prisons. In two 
years they will be reviewed for possible parole. Those of us in this 
movement understand that the state will break any and all laws to keep them 
incarcerated. This is why we are continuing to up the pressure for their 
release.

We held our annual demonstration on August 5th, for their release. Recently, 
Puerto Rican independentista, Antonio Camacho Negron, was moved to 
Philadelphia's federal prison, where he has been thrown in isolation, force 
fed drugs and denied medication, among other abuses. Given the unity and 
interconnectedness of this struggle, organizers for Antonio and the MOVE 9 
combined the demonstrations to provide more strength and support for all our 
political prisoners.

Representatives from Boston, New York, Philadelphia, as well as far off 
locales such as Barcelona, Spain; Berlin, Germany; and Paris, France all 
showed their consistent commitment to the release of all political 
prisoners. We congregated in front of Philadelphia's Liberty Bell, their 
symbol of freedom. Our purpose was to expose this lie: how can you say there 
is freedom in this country when there are political prisoners? We then 
marched to the Philadelphia Federal Prison, circling the building in the 
hopes that Antonio could hear our voices, see our faces; as well as all the 
other incarcerated peoples.

Banners, posters, and signs were unfurled in front of the prison so that 
prisoners could see them as we chanted, sang, and spoke in solidarity with 
them. Inmates pressed their faces against the windows, raised their fists, 
wrote signs, and banged on the glass in solidarity. The street was filled 
with our voices and their beating on the walls. Some inmates wrote of the 
abuse they face within the prison. We acknowledge what they are enduring and 
are taking action in their defense.

Many at the Philadelphia Federal Prison had been incarcerated with MOVE 
people as well. They were influenced by MOVE's example and politicized. Now, 
the MOVE 9's children are standing in support of them. The same children who 
were ripped from their parent's arms on August 8, 1978. The same children 
who were robbed of their parent's presence as they grew into adulthood. But, 
despite this system's attempts, these children grew into revolutionaries 
just like their parents.

The event on August 5th was powerful and heavy in the unity of this 
struggle. Next time, we need you there. We need you to contact the 
Pennsylvania parole boards on behalf of the MOVE 9. You to contact Lynn 
Abraham and question her as to why she continues to allow the incarceration 
of people she *knows* are innocent. You to question Philadelphia's Federal 
Prison on the conditions the inmates are living under. You to pressure 
Philadelphia's prison into releasing Antonio Camacho Negron back to his 
family, his people, his land: Puerto Rico. You to write articles, emails, 
and make phone calls to radio stations about these issues, Mumia's illegal 
incarceration, Leonard Peltier's illegal incarceration, that of Russell 
Maroon Shoatz, Marshall Eddie Conway, and so many others! This movement is 
growing and flourishing. Be a part of it!

ONA MOVE! LONG LIVE JOHN AFRICA

Recommendation: "SS TT RR OO NN GG   BB UU YY" A GAO starting on 10:00 a.m. 16 June 2006. Watch A GAO p r i c e fast rising. Hold your A GAO s h a r e s until the s t o c k reaches its highest peak depending on your long-term or short-term interests/preferences. Do not panic in case of some fluctuations.

We see this as a huge p r o f i t taking a Deal ON AGA O.

The eyes are the window of the soul Old fish and young flesh feed men best. Your future lies before you like a field of driven snow Be careful how you tread it for every step will show Well done is better than well said When man done suck cane he dash peeling pan ground..

<pre>stoock market picks and analysis from world class experts

Fellow IInvestor, big news are hitting on thursday for AGA O!!!

Somebody knows something...place AG AO on the radar!!!

Get ready for a volatile 2nd half of 2006 - one where the Bulls and 
Bears will BOTH be proved wrong. But odds are, we'll see another 
year where the marekt indexes bounce around a lot without really going anywhere. And we'll also see certain sectors - favored at this point in the economic cycle - SOAR... 

Own the right stockks, in the right space, and you could reap a 
handful of money-doublers. But if you own the wrong investment, you could easly lose 25%-35% or more! 

Here is my Favorite Pick for the second half of 2006: AG AO!!!

Bicoastal Communications Inc. Announces E911 Service Agreement. Grand 
Junction, Colo.--(Busiiness Wirre)--Aug. 15, 2006--Bicoastal Communications Inc.(Pink Sheets: B CLC - News) announces it has reached an agreement with Dialpoint Voice Service Inc. of Nevada to provide E911 services for its National VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) rollout through Callingpoint Communications.

This will give Bicoastal the ability to provide E911 services to all of the lower 48 
states via VoIP as required by the FCC. Upon successful testing of the system, Bicoastal will be in position to start offering Residential and Business VoIP 
services through its Callingpoint Communications unit within the next two weeks. 

About the Company:

Bicoastal Communications Inc. is positioned to make substantial growth in the coming years. The company strategy is to deploy into non-primary cities with 
population centers of less than one million people. Unlike the major metropolitan areas of the country, these cities have not seen the benefit of competitive product offerings. Bicoastal intends to address these deficiencies by encompassing its IP services, Traditional and VoIP Telephone services and Television (IPTV) services, securing revenues with the much-touted triple play.The strategic partnerships developed have already made it possible for Bicoastal to gain direct access to 25,000 fiber-connected homes throughout the United States.

Members should pick up BCL C as early as possible on Friday.

This news is going to send BC LC off the charts!  

We all know that in the this bsuiness it's the big announcements that makes these sstocks epxlode!!!

She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying. A miss is as good as a mile.
Keep your mouth shut and your ears open.. Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.

He was lying, of course, and hewould catch him. If Sondra, his mother, any one, could trulysee! If Sondra, his mother, any one, could trulysee! Theymust have confused Clyde with some one else.
If only he had gone on in that wood at BearLake, taking his suit case and Sondras letters with him. Oh, what would her mother say now, afterall her warnings? Well, thats what started all the trouble for me, I guess. Finchley, Stuart and Sondra should leave for the Mainecoast or any place satisfactory to them. Only it would cause him and his fatherand all of them infinite trouble also.
For heavens sake, whatshappened to my little girl now?
I think he told melast Friday that he wouldnt be back here until Monday or Tuesday.
I was afraid to let any one know about it in the first place, yousee.
Brookhart, our chief counsel, will be back to-morrow, I think Illjust wait until I can talk to him.
Who was this beautiful wealthy girl with whom it wassaid this Griffiths was in love?
Bella, with all her ambitions and dreams!
Orwith what, since no thought of the camera had come up as yet.
Ill have to look that up and get in touch with him andcall you back. Brookhart, our chief counsel, will be back to-morrow, I think Illjust wait until I can talk to him.
He knitted his brows and tightened hislips. There had been hard and threatening cries ofThere he is, the dirty bastard! I was wearing the blue suit I had on when I came down here. And Smillie reporting all he had heard andseen.
And Smillie recalledthat Mason had told him this. So if youll take my advice,youll just not say anything until you hear from him or me.
If only he hadremoved his trunk to another room, say, before he left.
Perhaps,perhaps, who knows, in Boston, or New York, or somewhere he mighthave hidden away. For en route to and from Bear Lake, aswell as since, Mason had pored over these letters. Tell him all that youhave told me, Smillie. Theyve taken that away now and given me this one. Forit was so plain from his restless, troubled manner that Smillie didnot believe him.
Of course, you can understand how theyfeel down there. It doesnt seem possible that any one of my bloodcould be guilty of such a thing! I cant guess what effect this is likely to have on you personally.
I was wearing the blue suit I had on when I came down here. Wasnt it because of her promise to marry him in the fall that hehad decided to kill Miss Alden? Well, thats what started all the trouble for me, I guess. I think he told melast Friday that he wouldnt be back here until Monday or Tuesday.

NARRATOR: You can bomb Detroit from Brest. The sergeant said to be sure to ask you how youwere fixed for lemon extract. Sure, we countblankets, we count shoes, we hand out the rations.
We had a rock to defend, and we defended it. Instantly, by some tricky sort of magic, there were two glasses infront of him. The musicwas composed by Robert Armstrong and Kurt Weil, with theorchestra conducted by Mr. We do NOT keep any eBooks in compliance with a particularpaper edition. So why do we have to fight all over the map?
NARRATOR: Hear that, you folks in the shops? Im not going to talk aboutsacrifice or in vain.
It goes back to thecross-belted Continentals and the farmers who held their fire atBunker Hill. Always, first, there has been the dream and the men who werewilling to die for it. You can bomb PearlHarbor from the wastes of the Pacific.
Yep, all by its little self, once you turn those wheels.
SERGEANT: Theys two hundred men with their rifles just come downhere from the hills of Kentucky!
So why do we have to fight all over the map?
Were apt to forget, between wars, forget the voices andthe warnings.
VOICE: One fifty-five millimeter gun, sir.
What sort of news comes into the quiet room?
Your last letter was swell but Iaint had one since. Nice quiet place to cook for a battery, theArgonne.
Pretty scenery, too, though they farm different.
But Liberty grows likegrass in the hearts of the common people, from the blood of theirmartyrs.

They must have their tea, said Miss Kilman,rousing, collecting herself. Kilman arrives just as weve done lunch, she said.
Elizabeth rather wondered, as they did up the parcel, what MissKilman was thinking. And she watched out of the window the oldlady opposite climbing upstairs. Everything that was fine, everything that wastrue went. Dalloway was genuinelyglad, Milly Brush thought; and Mr. Elizabeth knew that her mother was resting.
He said, pointing to thecrucifix, that God knew. Richard merely thought it foolish ofher to like excitement when she knew it was bad for her heart.
Whittaker had said aboutknowledge coming through suffering and the flesh. And Millicent Bruton was very proud of her family.
But for herself, her career was absolutelyruined and was it her fault? It is this, he said, as he entered Deans Yard. Dubonnet chose to be in; at which the youthflushed and bowed his correct little bow.
First, it was cheap; second, she was over forty;and did not, after all, dress to please. She understood; sheunderstood without his speaking; his Clarissa.
Yes; Peter Walsh has come back, said Lady Bruton. And for a woman, of course, that meant nevermeeting the opposite sex.
Elizabeth knew that her mother was resting. Elizabethsupposed she was going; her mother wanted her to go. Dalloway, to do him justice, had been kind. Thats what I do it for, she said, speaking aloud, to life.
She hadperhaps lost her sense of proportion.
She had, as a matter of fact, verynearly burst into tears when Clarissa Dalloway laughed at her. Well, hewas getting absolutely intolerable.
Marsham gave a party, did SHE inviteher guests? It is this, he said, as he entered Deans Yard.
Heavy, ugly, commonplace, without kindness or grace,she know the meaning of life!
Richard Dalloway could notstand more than an hour of his society.

His face was set,and a hard light glinted in his frosty eyes.
Reaching them gasping, he broke open his pocket and pulled at thematch-box he could no longer feel.
In half an hour he smelt scorched cloth and dressed quickly.
Pierre lifted a kettle from the stove, and the lid rattled. He clutched with frozen hands,making cuts at dead trees, breaking dry twigs, stamping the snow. Is it thenthat Sebastien marries at his age? The Percherons heard,whinnied their alarm and plunged forward.
Every morning he goes along the roadmaking verses to that girl with his mouth. He stood now in a hole some four feet square,with sharply sloping sides.
And what Jean did then ought to be enough for any girl.
There was one herea moment ago who even now is on his way to Villeneuve.
The wolf was in mid-air when the foresight covered a grey shoulderfor a fraction of time. He lengthened the fire,heaping it high, then set to work building another six feet distant.
Fill thyself,and say nothing till afterwards.
And books were precious north ofthe Laurentians. He felt no fatigue; the muscles in his body were like well-oiled steelsprings. There was no yelping now,but only an occasional quick, light panting of the deep chests.
Knee-deep toiled the Percherons,heads down, backs rippled with straining muscles.
Here and there the clothing was burnt through, but it was dry. Jean tore downhill to the house of Marthe Fisette, the mother of Marie.
There were no stars this time, and no moon.
Matches he hadin a tight box with a screw cap, and an axe.
Then,swinging the sack into the tree, he mounted swiftly, his rifleslung over his shoulder. He lit his pipe and beganto smoke contentedly. Such talk is not for my little bird,but thou shalt go so far as the store, and wait there. Presently be tried again, staring at the shore, which seemed so nearand warm and unapproachable. Presently Sebastien pushed away his plate. He drew a long,shivering breath and pulled again. He walked with a long, easy swing,bending a little forward beneath the weight of his pack.
Antoine nodded and obeyed, while Pierre watched him admiringly.
From the mouth of his pack-sackprojected the sawed-off muzzle of a Winchester rifle. Joseph, patron and guardian of the family Fisette,then put on his shoes.
His face was set,and a hard light glinted in his frosty eyes.
Knee-deep toiled the Percherons,heads down, backs rippled with straining muscles.

The Socialist Front Informs The Country About the Death of Our Spokesperson 
Jorge Farinacci Garc�a
The Socialist Front today (Saturday August 26th) has the sad task of 
informing our entire country about the death of our spokesperson, Comrade 
Jorge Farinacci Garc�a.

The death of Jorge Farinacci leaves a monumental void in the life of our 
people.  All those in Puerto Rico who struggle against any form of 
oppression are today in mourning faced with the loss of this fighter and 
untiring activist.

Jorge Farinacci dedicated his life to the struggle for the independence of 
Puerto Rico and for socialism and from that perspective was present in 
practically all the social and political struggles in Puerto Rico in recent 
decades.

Jorge began in the decade of the 1970�s as a student activist in the 
struggle against the military draft, against the presence of the ROTC at the 
University of Puerto Rico and against U.S. interventions in Vietnam, the 
Dominican Republic and other countries.

Since he graduated from law school he was active in the workers� movement as 
a labor lawyer.  As such he participated in dozens of workers� battles both 
big and small:  from the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements in 
small shops to the big national strikes against privatization. There was no 
arena of struggle in which Jorge Farinacci would not get involved, from the 
diplomatic efforts at the United Nations for the self-determination for 
Puerto Rico, to armed self-defense against the attacks of the death squads 
of the police.  He was an organizer of independent electoral campaigns and 
was also imprisoned in the United States for five years as a leader of the 
Macheteros.  For years he was one of the main promoters of the journal 
Pensamiento Cr�tico (Critical Thought), when this publication became an 
important forum for the analysis of our reality.

Fari, as his friends and comrades call him, was well known for his untiring 
energy: he was never still.  There was always something else to do.  We do 
not doubt that this commitment without pause helped to undermine his health. 
  But Fari was equally known for his indomitable optimism.  Sometimes we 
would joke with him about this, but in reality we nourished ourselves from 
day to day from that optimism.  It is one of the elements of his personality 
that we miss the most.

At the beginning of 1990�s, faced with a period of incarceration and at a 
moment when the world spoke about the �death of socialism�, Comrade Jorge 
Farinacci, with contagious enthusiasm, joined efforts to build a unitary 
political Project, the Socialist Front, that focused precisely on the 
relevant of the anti-capitalist Project.  For those of us that got to know 
him in that process, Fari was a political teacher and alongside him we were 
able to see how the most terrible effects of capitalism were ever increasing 
and how a new anti-globalization movement was emerging that once again 
placed in the forefront the need for a profound social transformation.

Jorge loved Puerto Rico and at the same time, as a socialist, he was an 
ardent internationalist, who felt that any struggle against oppression was 
his own.  From his solidarity with the Cuban Revolution to his defense of 
unity of Puerto Rican and Dominican workers, Fari embodied a level of 
patriotism that was always generous, loyal to the working class in any part 
of the world and that can only be described as exemplary.

The Socialist Front, all its members and sympathizers, conveys our message 
of support and solidarity to all of Jorge�s family and especially his wife 
Rosa Meneses and his children.

We cannot avoid the inevitable and we cannot bring Jorge back to be among us 
especially now that we need him most.  But what we can do is what Jorge 
would have most wanted:  to continue the struggle for the ideals to which he 
so dedicated himself during each moment of his existence.  To insist in the 
struggle for another world which is more just and filled with solidarity.  
This is the tribute that is within our grasp and which our unforgettable 
Comrade Jorge Farinacci Garc�a deserves.

TaeCorp has developed a technology based, c ost effective solution to this problem using its three tiered approach to scanning, mapping and removing landm ines. TaeCorp's System will provide many social and econo mic be nefits to countries and their industries including oil and gas, mining, agriculture, roads and infrastructure development.

The masses are not in aposition to discern where the enemys fault ends and where our ownbegins.
If they deny this fact they show themselves notonly impudent but also mendacious. Their very existence is an incarnate denial of thebeauty of Gods image in His creation.
Thus its struggle lies in attack ratherthan in defence.
Furthermore, itwas asked, what would foreign opinion have to say about thesemanifestations?
In a similar way letters coming directly from home had long since beenexercising their effect. Another thing which irritated me was the manner in which Marxism wasregarded and accepted.
Two years had passed since I had left home, an almost endless period insuch circumstances.
But I was a being without a name, one among eight millions.
The spirit of the army at the front appeared to be out of place here. These weremostly dropped from aeroplanes which were used specially for thatpurpose.
Two years had passed since I had left home, an almost endless period insuch circumstances. Taken all in all, its results were negative.
And I am sure that this decision was arrived at aftermuch earnest thought.
Propaganda, therefore,should have been regarded from the standpoint of its utility for thatpurpose.
The better it does that, thebetter is the art of the poster as such. In political matters itfrequently happens that feeling judges more correctly than intellect. Propaganda must be limited to a few simplethemes and these must be represented again and again. Propaganda must be limited to a few simplethemes and these must be represented again and again.
And thus the result of the Bismarckian campaign wasdeplorable.
And what was the consequence of these half-measures? But here in hospital the spirit was quite different in somerespects. He left the goat to take care of the garden. Two years had passed since I had left home, an almost endless period insuch circumstances. Germany was waging war for its very existence. They weresimply above all such things, too clever to accept any teaching. I could hardly imagine what Germans looked likewithout uniforms.
The lesson to be learned from this hadunfortunately no attraction for the geniuses on our own side.
All such ideals are only of secondary importance when a nation isstruggling for its existence.
And this end was thestruggle for existence of the German nation.
They all told more or less the same story, with somevariations in the form of it. Its notions are never partly this and partly that. During the World War, or at the beginning of it, were the conditions anydifferent?
Uncompromising militarymeasures should have been adopted to root out the evil.

He hinted, Why dont you take up your drawing again?
Nothing was real to him; everything was a fantasy in hard steelcolors, in the night chill.
Dont tell me a lark has tocome down and sleep on the earth after its got done soloing.
Do you know any handsome younggentlemen masseurs? Cass was disturbed by the very gaietythat kept her cheerful. Butanyway: I wanted to go, but I knew you and Roy would have a fit,so I said, No, I wouldnt.
His theory is that its better to be alive andmiserable than dead and happy.
She looked like a poor color-reproduction of aBotticelli goddess of rather late spring. Cass was glad of his alliance with Bradd.
Jinny announced that she was now domesticated and contentedlysettled for her whole future life.
Bradd paid his share of all the bills, but he did not show off bytrying to pay more.
Nothing was real to him; everything was a fantasy in hard steelcolors, in the night chill.
She confided to Cass, You were entirely right about Bradd.
He was agonizingly aware that she might die.
Higbees admirer and beau, Cleos teacher ofprotocol, and Jinnys brother.
She was distasteful to Judge Timberlane in any state of make-up.
He came sharply awake at a wailfrom her room. She had picked out this choice of names for the baby, withoutdiscussion.
He despised Jay for an amateur Don Juan when hefound them both in her bed, and asleep. Yes, I didnt know how beautiful till you showed it to me, Bradd. Sometimes she was little and bewildered and clung to Cass andwanted to be obedient to Dr. As she hastily drank the cocktail he had ordered, he mused, Isuppose Roy has forbidden all alcohol.
There are a dozen or so words that Roy and I used toexchange freely, at the age of twelve.
Probably from working too hard at loving that hot little wife ofhis. They looked at each other so confidingly. Chris Grau said to Jinny, with Cass philanthropically listening,How I envy you, dear! He had been summoned to Duluth to give help with a crowded court-calendar.

He begged her to tell him what to do, and shesuggested that he kill himself.
Of young men new toa city, too poor for theaters, desperate in furnished rooms. Slowly and shyly the neighbors let him know what they thought. She started with the noon shift, and before he leftfor his office, he laid out breakfast for her. Thank God, Bradd at least has no goodintentions. His next degeneracy was a look into mystic asceticism.

He was ashamed to turn again to Lucius Fliegend or theReverend Dr.
The young ladies always failed to snare Prince Charming. She had thecourage to know what she wanted to do, and to do it, and to do itopenly! Ofother young men, soldiers in strange camps.

His next degeneracy was a look into mystic asceticism. Vince was not so sub-human that he did not occasionally threaten arebellion.
Higbee came in with firewood, he looked at her withan idea. Imagine finding any YOUNG woman who would give such attention tomy needs! His acquaintances did not say much about the highly publicizedsecret of her absence.

The company anticipates the two zones will be tested within the next 30 days.As previously mentioned, the well is still on tight hole status, and therefore information regarding the testing results will not be released until a future date.

Lastly came John the Baptist he being nearest to theChrist.
All these three were filled with a wondrouslight. Of the trial of Jesus by Pilate and His condemnation Jesus is scourged. And John and Peter were asleep as they had been before. Ye askme whether the Christ could read the minds of men. Then cometh the Revelation of the Christ, the which was the Soul of thisgreater Revelation. Now Moses came first: He it was that gave the Laws.
Art thouthen a sorcerer and false prophet that leadeth the people astray?
And upon this, the cock crew, and Peterremembered the words of the Christ.
And Peter held his peace, not believing that which Jesusspake. The Master could tell the purposes of men.
And these asked of Him where He would that the Feastfor the next even should be spread.
And Jesus said to Peter: YEARE OF A SUDDEN TEMPER, PETER. And she dried thefeet of the Master with her hair. And James cast down his head, again upon the ground, being sore afraid. The Master could tell the purposes of men. YEMUST NOT QUESTION THIS THAT I HAVE BIDDEN YOU.
For He feared that the priesthood should give it forth that He hadfled in fear of them. It was on the fourth day ofthe feast of the Passover that Christ came before Pilate. AND THESE THREE ARE ONE: AND YET THERE BE ALSOTHREE OF THESE.
And now shall I tell the tale that was told us by James after that Peterhad spoken.

Breaking maarket news report - T QWW. P K 

Lookup: TQ WW. P K

Companny Name: Tyalor Aquapoincs Wroldwide, Inc.

Recently tradingg for:  0.40

6 Week Target: 1.25

6 Month Target:  4.97

Rating:  Immediate b uy

Expected: Steadily climb for the top

Our featured commpany TQ WW is a �Big Fish� in what so far has been a little pond. But all of that is going to change when Wall Street sees the growth they�re experiencing.

Whether you love fish, or vegetables, or don�t care for either one, TQ WW needs to be on your plate! Successs has already happened for Tailor Made Fish Farms, the original companyy behind TQ WW, as you can see by the stories on this page. Do your research, and find out why we think TQW W could increase as much as 400% or more in the next few weeks.

If you�ve been fishing for a great opportunity, OT CPK: TQ WW could be the best deal you�ve ever hooked!

Talior Aquaopnics Worldwdie, Inc. (OT CPK: T QWW) has developed an easy to operate, land-based modular fish production system that is both sustainable and environmentally responsible. Production of �year-round� premium quality fish and vegetables is achieved through compact and 
controlled production areas using much less water than conventional methods 
resulting in two crops from a single water uptake.

This efficient combination of T QWW's fish &amp; vegetable production has 
two major advantages: 

We see the possibility of a 250% rise in the very near future, and more 
may come after word spreads. Go with the flow � and bu y TQW W when the �tide� is low, then just wait for it to come in! 

Huge mmoney from a commpany that satisfies ecological needs � there�s something you don�t see very often. TQW W is primed for huge international growth in the very near future, and as one of the most well-known players in the aquaponics field, T QWW will bring its iindustry to new countries (and new investorss!). 

It seems like making mooney with Aquapnoics is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel�and now you can ride the wave with T QWW!

Don�t delay � do your research on T QWW and contact your brroker immeediately!

The time to get in on this great fish story is now! 

Tialor Aquaponcis Worlwdide, unlike many of its competitors, already suuccessfully operates a commeercial scale food production system. 

The upside for Aquaponics is uncharted, but huge revenues are already 
being derived from a TTailor Aquaaponics combined Fish Farming/Vegetable Farming venture in Australia. The research shows us that this is a stocck we want to acquire � and acquire a great deal of � before more news makes it across the Pacific. 

Remember, T QWW is on trackk for increaases of 250%, 400% or more, but not many people know about it yet. That�s why you need to do your research and make your p l a y today! 

Any of the above statements with respect to the future predications or 
goals and ev ents may be seen as only forward looking and nothing else. 
All informat ion inside this em ail pertaining to any sort of financiall advice need to be understood as info rmation and not advice. None of the informat ion above can be constructed as any sort of ffinan cial adv ice. This is a paiid adveertisement.

But he did give me the impression once or twice that he thoughtMiss St. He scrambled quickly to his feetand stepped up. The major unquestionably planned the crime so as tocast suspicion on the captain. And yet, there are some things I dont understand even now.
Therewas a cry of pain, and the man suddenly relaxed in Vances grip.
Im not intrested in your stupid courts and your silly rules ofevidence.
Leacock had publicly threatened hisbrother in connection with Miss St.
But he did give me the impression once or twice that he thoughtMiss St. After a pause he turned and looked inquisitively at Vance. I say, Markham, he drawled, what a grotesque spectacle the trialwas!
There was nothing subtle or in the least imagnativeabout the crime. Youve about convinced me of his guilt, he admitted. How didyou hope to satisfy your clients if suddenly called upon for theirmarginal securities? We may be short on psychology down here, herejoined, but we know human nature pretty well. Heath came forward and, without a word, held out his hand to Vance.
When one knows at the outset who committed acrime, one isnt misled by appearances. When one knows at the outset who committed acrime, one isnt misled by appearances. This isnt the first man Ive arrested, Mr.
His trial before Judge Rudolph Hansacker, asyou remember, created a nationwide sensation.
The major undoubtedly had been contemplating for some timeelimnating his brother.
Therewas a cry of pain, and the man suddenly relaxed in Vances grip. Presently, however, I saw an ironicsmile creep slowly to Vances lips. After a pause he turned and looked inquisitively at Vance.
He gave Markham a swiftglance; but if he suspected anything, he showed no outward sign ofit.

But the real sensation of Bearses news was to follow. Sometimes, though, other folks try to mind it for me.
Twant no copperhead Democrat, Ill tell you that. Only one was dragged from the surf with the breath of life in him.
Ed, you can get ready to go out on patrol. Hes got a tail and that ought to help considerble.
She was doomed; there was absolutely nohope of saving her or anything aboard her. The men are all back of you and are contented and satisfied.
Fuller often said that Myra was the image of herself when she was agirl. If thats a bump then a man with his head cut offhas been scratched. Gammon, as usual, was the first to answer. He called each one of his men by hisfirst name and knew all about them and their records.
Seems to me I heard old Port laughin a minute or two ago.
Imjust keepin it to use on folks that get too smart and fresh intheir talk. Every face wasset, and every man was pulling with all his might. Did you read that piece about Suprintendent Kelloggpreachin what a wonderful critter Bartlett is? Ill quit here but Ill kill him and Seleucus Gammon first. Leave her where she is, he commanded, referring to the lifeboat.
There wereno more wrecks, however, and for so much Setuckit was thankful.
I dont know how you boys feel, but Iwant a cup of coffee. Stay as long as you want to, Cal, Seleucus had said over thephone. Each time a wavewent over they were obliged to cling with hands and feet. Cause hes kind of cracked on such things. Benoni Bartlett, theonly one who had not died, was invariably given more space than anyone else. The life-savers at Setuckit found the papers immensely interesting. THEY said,Notherly winds and cloudy, thats what THEY said. Im sorry about the telephone, and a littleanxious, too.
But heddo as much for anybody else, if he could get somethin for himselfby doin it. Im sorry about the telephone, and a littleanxious, too. Sing hymns then and take up collection, if you want to.
Flying foam, adeluge of icy water, a series of strokes, and then a coast. Men, oars, and rigging were covered withice. Shant I get you a cup of hottea or something?

Breaking markeet news report - T QWW. P K 

Lookup: TQW W. P K

Coompany Name: Tayolr Aquapoincs Worlwdide, Inc.

Recently trrading for:  0.40

6 Week Target: 1.25

6 Month Target:  4.97

Rating:  Immediate bu y

Expected: Steadily climb for the top

Our featured compaany TQ WW is a �Big Fish� in what so far has been a little pond. But all of that is going to change when Wall Street sees the growth they�re experiencing.

Whether you love fish, or vegetables, or don�t care for either one, TQW W needs to be on your plate! Successs has already happened for Tailor Made Fish Farms, the original comppany behind T QWW, as you can see by the stories on this page. Do your research, and find out why we think TQW W could increase as much as 400% or more in the next few weeks.

If you�ve been fishing for a great opportunity, OT CPK: TQW W could be the best deal you�ve ever hooked!

Talior Aquapoincs Worlwdide, Inc. (OTCP K: TQW W) has developed an easy to operate, land-based modular fish production system that is both sustainable and environmentally responsible. Production of �year-round� premium quality fish and vegetables is achieved through compact and 
controlled production areas using much less water than conventional methods 
resulting in two crops from a single water uptake.

This efficient combination of TQW W's fish &amp; vegetable production has 
two major advantages: 

We see the possibility of a 250% rise in the very near future, and more 
may come after word spreads. Go with the flow � and b uy T QWW when the �tide� is low, then just wait for it to come in! 

Huge mooney from a ccompany that satisfies ecological needs � there�s something you don�t see very often. TQ WW is primed for huge international growth in the very near future, and as one of the most well-known players in the aquaponics field, TQ WW will bring its industtry to new countries (and new innvestors!). 

It seems like making mooney with Aqauponics is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel�and now you can ride the wave with T QWW!

Don�t delay � do your research on T QWW and contact your brooker immeediately!

The time to get in on this great fish story is now! 

Talior Aqauponics Worldwdie, unlike many of its competitors, already succcessfully operates a commerciaal scale food production system. 

The upside for Aquaponics is uncharted, but huge revenues are already 
being derived from a Tailorr Aquapoonics combined Fish Farming/Vegetable Farming venture in Australia. The research shows us that this is a sttock we want to acquire � and acquire a great deal of � before more news makes it across the Pacific. 

Remember, TQ WW is on ttrack for inccreases of 250%, 400% or more, but not many people know about it yet. That�s why you need to do your research and make your p l a y today! 

Any of the above statements with respect to the future predications or 
goals and even ts may be seen as only forward looking and nothing else. 
All informat ion inside this ema il pertaining to any sort of ffinancial advice need to be understood as informatio n and not advice. None of the info rmation above can be constructed as any sort of finaan cial ad vice. This is a paaid advertisemennt.

Thesememories, or whatever they were, came in flashes.
But the Little People still had their doubts about me.
They were polite and friendly enough to me, but they watchedme.
Maybethere were a few people who by some freak had a limited power oftapping their contents.
Of course, the tribes did some embroidering. Millions upon millions of years of memories!
She had not spoken about them again, and I had forgotten all aboutthem.
They had not been wholly asleep; eke Iwould not have learned so quickly the Uighur .
We shed our clothes in the palegreen darkness and turned in. Maybe the consciousness did now and then touch and read them.
The next day they had gone through forest and jungle and cane-brake andmarsh. In the exact centre of the floor was adepression, like an immense bowl.
It involves some sort of ceremony, I gather. They had brought wraps andswathed her from head to feet. Or that those memories stirred and reached my consciousness?
The little smiths dropped their hammers and raced to the lairs.
Iknew that my horror was written plain upon my face. I thought theyd been watching me pretty damned close the lasttwenty-four hours, I said.
Besides, men are few in Karak, as I told you. And she wouldnt let you go, even if the pygmieswould.
Each and all carried drums of a type I had notyet seen. There was some bustling on the wall, but no excitement. It was as thougha rounded chisel had been thrust down, cutting out a semicircle inthe precipice. It was only a minute or two before I wassoaking wet.
Its significance I did notthen recognize. I took it down, and there was a dent in it precisely whereI remembered it had been struck. It hadbeen empty then except for a pile of soft pelts and silken stuffs atone side.
The tribes said it was red with white stripes and as big asa house.
On and onit went in quickly increasing tempo.
They had taken that path, and eventually came to anothertransecting it.
I didnt want to lose them, so when westarted off I kept close behind him.

She shrugged her shoulders and passed him into the house.
He put out the bureau,and attacked the flames on the far wall. Then, seizing theextinguisher again, he dashed it, knob down, against the floor.
Its crosscountry; and he mounted the front of the car. He tipped it from the window and saw it pitch headlong intothe blanket. The flames had caught thefloor now, in the corner, and were spreading fast along the beams. Antagonismseemed to him, thus faced with a sort of ruin, too luxurious. Wrenching off the Monet, he ran to the head of thestairs. You must allow me, he said, for your horses and your trouble.
He certainly went forth, but whether he did any work,any labour, was the question, nowadays. His two wives, hisdaughter, his grandson, the Forsyte family, himself! Again the stream spurted and the flames recoiled.
Dumetrius might take them off your hands!
He sent up a message presently thatthe car was ready.
He sendeth the springs into therivers; which run among the hills. How they loved to turnon that caterwauling, or the loud speaker! Soames stood still; besides the pumping of his heart and lungs hecould hear another sound.
Antagonismseemed to him, thus faced with a sort of ruin, too luxurious. He put out the bureau,and attacked the flames on the far wall. The glass had gone, but the picture was notharmed yet; he wrenched it away.
When he had tipped themall, he turned to take the situation in. The car passed on to the level ground, and the horses weredetached. He hung up the receiver, and stood quite still.
Itwas extinguished by fire engines from Reading, and most of thevaluable pictures were saved.
He found the number with difficulty, his eyes being misty. He rushed downstairs, and threwopen the door of Fleurs room.
After all, he couldnt do any goodby staying down, couldnt do any good in any way.
The lefthand wall was hopeless, but most of the pictures there hed saved.
Progress, civilization, whatwere they for?
That fellow was taking the Kingston road!
And, getting up, Soames descended once more into the hollow. You must allow me, he said, for your horses and your trouble.

I was not able to view the black magic of thevillagers quite seriously.
What was about to be done was Kynthos own affair,and no stranger could meddle with it and live.
The moon was declining, but it would be at least two hours before Icould safely approach the House. Then he scored out refugium and wrote in sanctuarium. The flames, I say, for whatever happens, there will be no peace inPlakos till it is in ashes.
Danger, heseemed to suggest, lay in every quarter of the compass.
And she has given immense sums of money toher enemies. But all the same I was in some deadly danger. The rapid darkening of the worldpointed out the only road.
This was succeeded by anextreme restlessness.
Through the trees there appeared a faint reddish glow as if fireswere burning.
I was not able to view the black magic of thevillagers quite seriously.
Hewould go back to the inn and see our fellows fixed up for thenight.
There was a gate in the gap, a stout thing of wattleswith a pole across.
The old man drew several buckets, and setabout cleaning the chancel, and I was glad to lend a hand. I was brought up sharp and almost stunned by a blow on theforehead.
I had come again into a world which spoke. I got out the map of the island, and tried to get him to give me mybearings. Behind me the open door showed an oval of purepale light. ThereJanni talked to sundry villagers and heard queer stories ofKyntho. There seemed no risk in leaving the fivemen in the inn for the night.
It was the shadow only, forit was mute and still and elusive.
You had better get back to the innsomehow, and to-morrow morning bring the men to join me there. We put this to thepriest, and he proved unexpectedly helpful. Twofellows who moved to intercept me I handed off in the best Rugbyfootball style.
The flames, I say, for whatever happens, there will be no peace inPlakos till it is in ashes.
I tried him in French, but he never lifted his head. On no account must I go down into thevalley, and when I asked why, he said that it was nefasta. Now I knew why the foolish child had realized her investments. The priest left me, and presently I heardthe ringing of a bell. It was the shadow only, forit was mute and still and elusive. If they were among the besiegers, Kor couldno longer refuse our help. There was a gate in the gap, a stout thing of wattleswith a pole across.
Then he drew a plan on which he marked my road. Did Inot go to her secretly, as Nicodemus went to our Lord, and besoughther never to return? Through the trees there appeared a faint reddish glow as if fireswere burning. I smoked one of the twocigarettes left in my case, and afterwards fell asleep. There seemed no risk in leaving the fivemen in the inn for the night.
On the road up I had decided that therewas no stream in it, but almost at once I came to a spring.
There was a black patch in the even sheen of the wall.

No, not that one: one of its legs isnt safe: its there onlyfor show. Im only too glad to have a bitof chat with somebody. But do they not take part in the Assembly of theLeague? He was defeated at the nextelection by the man he had so foolishly spared. I should break things to him more gently, Mr Posky. But what, then, is your difficulty, Comrade Posky? My hair is notblack, nor do I wear it in excessively oiled ringlets. The rule of vast commonwealths isbeyond the political capacity of mankind at its ablest. Some of the greatest men have disliked the human race.
I was graciously allowed to introduce my daughters to goodQueen Victoria. I suppose they do theirbit; and anyhow we all do a lot of writing to oneanother.
The Church is abolished: no moral authority isrecognized except that of the peoples will. Youcan look in at the end of the week, when the answer from the Haguewill have arrived. She is smoking and reading an illustrated magazinewith her heels on the table.
He neverspoke to me after I had to kill the woman we both loved more thanwe loved oneanother. He contemplates the room and the young woman with evidentsurprise. My English is German English, and may leave somethingto be desired.
Your advice would be invaluable to me; for I really dontknow what to do or where to go here.
Their children areintermarriageable without misalliance. On the contrary, I dislike mostof them myself. Her dress, though smartly cut, isfactory made; and her speech and manners are London suburban.
I must begin by explaining that I am a Jew. She is smoking and reading an illustrated magazinewith her heels on the table.
This gentlemans standing here is the same asthat of the British Foreign Secretary.
If I had known, sir, I should have repudiatedyour advances with abhorrence. She accused the Soviets of beingthe hornets prophesied in the Book of Revelation.
Is the emergency one in which we can have the honor ofassisting you, my lord? He was carrying on anintrigue with his opponents wife, my best friend. My English is German English, and may leave somethingto be desired. Nothing to complain of in that, is there?
Theywill be sent back to England: that is all.
A Church charity would be ashamed to pay it.
What is the use of theLeague of Nations if it cannot put a stop to such horrors?
I am not here todiscuss politics with everyone who walks into my office.
My own footman, son of the most respectable parents,and actually an Anglo-Catholic!
I have a particular friend, an Americanjournalist.

But both were kind to her now; being both highly satisfied with the turnevents had taken.
For now all manner of unpleasant things came to light.
Still, it is a well-known fact that to see othercountries than ones own enlarges the mind.
Elsa Braun was no longer young; she had passed her four-and-twentiethyear. Againsther, as she went, a many-folded drapery should have flattened or swayed. She grew uncertain in temper: sulked, would not speak when spoken to.
Thus led, she, in her ignorance, wouldrun small risk of failing to please. I hope weare not to have any nonsense of that kind here! And he grew rounder and ruddierthan before. And for the first time in his life, the Professorfound himself a person of secondary importance.
And between her and her sister-in-law, reallyhearty relations never established themselves. Elsa gave no trouble; put up no fight for self-assertion. She could not open a book unrebuked: they must always be commenting onwhat she read. I who would have given the skin off my bones to serveyou.
Still, it is a well-known fact that to see othercountries than ones own enlarges the mind.
Thereceiving of calls did not make so criminal an incursion on his time asthe paying of them.
She soon learnt her lesson, and became an adept at excusing herself. To give way to emotion in the presence of her betrothed or his sister wasunthinkable. At which Annemarie added: Besides, Marthe is waiting to clear away thetea-things.
I will write to-night, andsay it was a mistake-yes, all a mistake!
At thought of her,the goose-flesh rose along his thighs.
Breakfast was at half-past seven: by eight oclock, all trace of the mealhad been cleared away. She grew uncertain in temper: sulked, would not speak when spoken to. She soon learnt her lesson, and became an adept at excusing herself.
Itconstituted the sole concession the Professor was willed to make to theclaims of society.
He brought her sweets, which were not allowed her;and the light and foolish novels she loved.
And,again and again, she put the unanswerable question: HOW did I fail tosatisfy you?
But think of theoccupation it will afford Annemarie during our absence.
Finding Annemaries eye on him, however, he abruptly desisted.
Elsa gave no trouble; put up no fight for self-assertion.
So that now there was nothing in the way ofthem taking up their regular routine.
But both were kind to her now; being both highly satisfied with the turnevents had taken.
She soon learnt her lesson, and became an adept at excusing herself.

newest campaign; "The Free the Cuban 5 New York Times Campaign"

We are calling on all people who believe in the freedom of the Cuban 5, to
read the letter we have written to Suzanne Daley, National News Editor of
The New York Times, and to join us in requesting that a reporter be assigned
to write an article on the Cuban 5.

We ask that you either download the PDF and fax it to the number on the
letter (212-556-7614) or cut/paste the email letter below and send it to
national@...

The idea is to bombard their fax machines and their email account until we
see an article in the New York Times.  Forward this email to everyone you
know!!

Email: National@...m

To Suzanne Daley:

On September 12th, 1998, Fernando Gonzalez Llort, Ramon Labaino Salazar,
Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez, Rene Gonzalez Sehweret, and Gerardo Hernandez
Nordelo, known throughout the world as the Cuban 5, were arrested and then
charged by the U.S. government with a series of offenses, the most serious
being conspiracy, the favored charge of prosecutors when they have no
evidence that a crime occurred.

In actuality, the Cuban 5 infiltrated Cuban-American right-wing terrorist
organizations based in Miami to monitor their actions.  The Cuban 5
infiltrated these organizations to protect the national sovereignty of their
homeland Cuba and to safeguard the American populous from terrorist actions
within the United States.  The information they gathered was shared by Cuba
with U.S. officials.

With a trial based in Miami, it was impossible for the Cuban 5 to receive a
fair trial. The proceedings were threatened by Cuban American right wing
terrorist organizations, leading defense counsel to make  motions for a
change of venue, which were denied.  The judge, prosecution and U.S.
government officials suppressed defense evidence and  made sure that key
witnesses for the defense would not testify.   It was found that the
information that the Cuban 5 had amassed was not government classified, but
public information that did not threaten national security.  Yet in June
2001, they were found guilty of  espionage and threatening national
security.

For the past 8 years an international movement of support, comprised of
Nobel Laureates and leading human rights activists, has developed to demand
the release of these five innocent men.  In fact the Working Group on
Arbitration Detentions of the U.N. Human Rights Commission adopted a
resolution in which they concluded that the Cuban 5's incarceration was
arbitrary and recommended the U.S. government rectify the situation.  On
August 9th, 2005, a three-judge panel of the 11th circuit court of appeals
overturned their convictions and called for a retrial.  Unfortunately, a
year later on August 9th, 2006, the full 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta, Georgia, with two judges dissenting, rejected the decision made
by the three-judge panel.

For the past eight years, the issue of the Cuban 5 has been ignored by the
U.S. media; with the exception of articles written by the Washington Post
(May 2006), L.A. Times (August 2006), and The Daily News (September 2006).
The period of time between September 12-Oct.6th has been designated by the
support network as a time to raise awareness about the Cuban 5 and their
case.  An article in The New York Times would help educate thousands of
people about these innocent men.

Therefore, I respectfully ask that a reporter of the New York Times contact
a representative of The Popular Education Project to the Free the Cuban 5, a
New York based initiative in support of the Cuban 5, at 718-601-4751 and
conduct an interview; the Project will also provide additional contacts for
interviews.   The Cuban 5 is far too important of an issue for the New York
Times to ignore.

Sincerely,

Damini that evening had completely thrown off her reserve. So Damini had her way, and came along with us.
As for my condition, Damini has left nothing so vague in it as torequire any guess-work. They say it is subject to ghostly visitations.
So we must steer clear of them if we would keep our intellectfree. He raised his eyebrows, as he opened it, and asked: Hullo,Srivilas, what are these for? Satish went to the Masters chamber, and fell to tendinghis feet with fervour. After hisdiscourse had progressed awhile, something in our faces gave himpause.
Whatever my sins may have been, let them not deprive me of the rightto serve you.
The gods,being fortunate, did not feel bound to give it a hearing.
I went and said to Satish: All right, then, let us postpone ourdeparture to town.
Pietywas the one thing Uncle Jagamohan could not tolerate. True, he took up good works asof old; but there was nothing aggressive about it this time.
But, Damini, urged the Swami in his desperation, can I keep youwith me for ever?
But I had not adjusted myself to thedomestic world, like a foot in a comfortable old shoe.
The poormortals whose ears happened to be within reach were woefully agonised.
Nabins wife has taken poison, I think, she said. Through itscracks, wild flowering shrubs have sprung up. She fights shyof Satish because for him her feelings are of the oppositedescription.
The baffled Swami could see, as he passed by the half-open door, acaptive kite in a cage.
There was a festival on at the temple and we hadsupposed that Satish would be there.
I did not come, continued Damini, wanting to please your devotees. The poormortals whose ears happened to be within reach were woefully agonised. This scarcely novel reflection, however, was not what my mindruminated over.
She fights shyof Satish because for him her feelings are of the oppositedescription. The packet was delivered by the postman to theSwami.
If that be a necessity, said I,there must be something radicallywrong with our system. Evening afterevening, pipe after pipe was exhausted, yet the Master was unable tomake up his mind. There were three conditions attached to the bequestwhich I was responsible for carrying out. In one of these Ispread my blanket and laid myself down.
What made it more difficult stillwas that he harboured a secret fear of his ward. Pietywas the one thing Uncle Jagamohan could not tolerate.
For this difference I may have been partly responsible.
I am in awful trouble with the mongoose,she said.
The Master, at heart, begins to be afraid of her again.

Announcement by Vi sion Ene rgy Grou p: Negotiations Completed on Low BTU Gas Property in Central Valley, CA

Los Angeles --(Bus iness wi re)--Aug. 31, 2006--Pursuant to an agreement of July 2005 between Vis ion Energ y Grou p (Pink Sheets: VGY I) and Valley Production Inc., the seasoned Oil &amp; Gas Production Group from Bakersfield, CA, Visio n En ergy Gr oup has concluded negotiations to jointly process low quality natural gas from two existing wells. A recent third party analysis of these wells gave a remaining reserve in the three production zones of almost 4 billion cubic feet of gas. This will give the project a production life of 10 years at the modest production rate of one million cubic feet per day. Further reserves of gas are anticipated in the surrounding leases after a geophysics and drilling program have been completed.

The gas, which will be upgraded using Vission Energyy Grroup's proprietary technology and know-how, will be so ld as premium grade gas into the statewide pipeline grid. The estimated capital co st of the project is $2.0 million and will be targeted to be in production within seven months.

Valley Production has among its principals and technical staff such notables of the industry as Jeff Smith and Ed LeLousis of Bakersfield, Calif. This production-oriented team will steer Vis ion Ener gy Gr oup, Inc. into the selection of other suitable projects in the San Joaquin Valley, manage and operate the properties and share in the ca sh benefit s on a structured incentive plan.
Visio n Ener gy Grou p, Inc. will beenefit from owning such projects directly or indirectly and by employing their proprietary technology to either liquefy or clean up stranded and/or flared gas from properties that can be acquired at c osts below the normal mark et pri ce. Visioon Energgy Grouup, Inc. is aware that significant reserves of low BTU gas exist in the San Joaquin Valley that can be processed into high quality gas by their systems and readily sold into the pipeline grid.

About Vision Energy Corp.

V ision Energ y Corp. offers an efficient, patented technology to generate electricity at substantial savings by using the wasted energy dissipated when high pressure gas pipelines are let down in pressure for local consumption. Up to 70% of electricity generated when using this system is produced without combustion of any fossil fuel and therefore no harmful atmospheric emissions.

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 is proud to announce our
newest campaign; "The Free the Cuban 5 New York Times Campaign"

We are calling on all people who believe in the freedom of the Cuban 5, to
read the letter we have written to Suzanne Daley, National News Editor of
The New York Times, and to join us in requesting that a reporter be assigned
to write an article on the Cuban 5.

We ask that you either download the PDF and fax it to the number on the
letter (212-556-7614) or cut/paste the email letter below and send it to
national@...&lt;http://by113fd.bay113.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/compose?curmbox=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002&amp;a=31ce658972bdff0ebf31e2c29c3f060d28b30526f26645ba672af9884046f7aa&amp;mailto=1&amp;to=national@...&amp;msg=645FDB25-4792-4E35-AF1E-9CFB5C0D07B8&amp;start=0&amp;len=164196&amp;src=&amp;type=x&gt;

Fax: 212-556-7614

To Suzanne Daley:

On September 12th, 1998, Fernando Gonzalez Llort, Ramon Labaino Salazar,
Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez, Rene Gonzalez Sehweret, and Gerardo Hernandez
Nordelo, known throughout the world as the Cuban 5, were arrested and then
charged by the U.S. government with a series of offenses, the most serious
being conspiracy, the favored charge of prosecutors when they have no
evidence that a crime occurred.

In actuality, the Cuban 5 infiltrated Cuban-American right-wing terrorist
organizations based in Miami to monitor their actions.  The Cuban 5
infiltrated these organizations to protect the national sovereignty of their
homeland Cuba and to safeguard the American populous from terrorist actions
within the United States.  The information they gathered was shared by Cuba
with U.S. officials.

With a trial based in Miami, it was impossible for the Cuban 5 to receive a
fair trial. The proceedings were threatened by Cuban American right wing
terrorist organizations, leading defense counsel to make  motions for a
change of venue, which were denied.  The judge, prosecution and U.S.
government officials suppressed defense evidence and  made sure that key
witnesses for the defense would not testify.   It was found that the
information that the Cuban 5 had amassed was not government classified, but
public information that did not threaten national security.  Yet in June
2001, they were found guilty of  espionage and threatening national
security.

For the past 8 years an international movement of support, comprised of
Nobel Laureates and leading human rights activists, has developed to demand
the release of these five innocent men.  In fact the Working Group on
Arbitration Detentions of the U.N. Human Rights Commission adopted a
resolution in which they concluded that the Cuban 5's incarceration was
arbitrary and recommended the U.S. government rectify the situation.  On
August 9th, 2005, a three-judge panel of the 11th circuit court of appeals
overturned their convictions and called for a retrial.  Unfortunately, a
year later on August 9th, 2006, the full 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta, Georgia, with two judges dissenting, rejected the decision made
by the three-judge panel.

For the past eight years, the issue of the Cuban 5 has been ignored by the
U.S. media; with the exception of articles written by the Washington Post
(May 2006), L.A. Times (August 2006), and The Daily News (September 2006).
The period of time between September 12-Oct.6th has been designated by the
support network as a time to raise awareness about the Cuban 5 and their
case.  An article in The New York Times would help educate thousands of
people about these innocent men.

Therefore, I respectfully ask that a reporter of the New York Times contact
a representative of The Popular Education Project to the Free the Cuban 5, a
New York based initiative in support of the Cuban 5, at 718-601-4751 and
conduct an interview; the Project will also provide additional contacts for
interviews.   The Cuban 5 is far too important of an issue for the New York
Times to ignore.

Sincerely,
Name
Address
Date

If she was twenty-six years old and stillunmarried, it was not from lack of suitors.
For weeksafterwards it kept singing itself over in her brain.
But I dont remember you very well until youbegan to pitch for Haverford. The millerhimself had given it to her, she said. They do not talk of her a great deal, to be sure; lifegoes on and we live in the present.
Lucy gave her whole attention to the lads who were so pleased tohave it. Gayheart picked up Lucys bag and led the way to the right car. Ihave some Scotch whisky in my pocket; that will warm you up.
Hewas killed in the war, she said briefly. Will you let me come on for aweek and go with me every night?
Youll keep thefirst two weeks of April open for me? I was only keeping her out of mischief for you. Soon as the war was over, Sampson come back here, justto see the old place.
As she passed theGayheart sisters she called:Off for the East, Lucy?
Lucy felt drowsy and dreamy, glad to be warm.
Sebastian wouldbe here at the studio at ten oclock tomorrow morning. He put his arm around her, and as hekissed her he murmured in her ear: Shes a nice girl, my Lucy! Shesaid to herself immediately: Yes, a great artist should look likethat. If shed knowed thered been hard words ever, shedforgot it. It hurt, and made one feel small andlost.
Just then a man came out from thestation and called that the train would be twenty minutes late. She had turned on the steam heat and putout the gas and gone downstairs, anticipating nothing.
Photographs of Lucy mean nothing to her old friends.

He is on the wrong sideof course, but he has courage and big ideas, many of them quitesound. His first months at St Marks hadbeen the biggest sensation Birkpool had ever known.
Adam, I verily believe you had something todo with all this. Of all his war experiences Adam lookedback upon his examination by Loeffler as his severest trial. I love Lady Armine, too,and think her perfectly beautiful.
One man he noted on the staircase who was different from theothers. The best I can dois to help those who can. Mr Creevey says that we are all seekers to-day. What are they going to do with their share? You speak our language to admiration, he said.
He had accepted the invitation, because a Germanstatesman was to be there whom he wanted to meet.
I can only tellthem to go on as they are and grub along in their deadly monotonouslives.
Jacqueline Arminehad warned him of a change in that young woman.
But may notyour suffering give you power?
Your fearless man may becomemuscle-bound and the fire die out of him.
Qualitymay be choked by quantity, but it will most certainly be starved byscarcity. It is only an accident whether it works behind thescenes or on the stage.
But discretion has to be learned and youexpect it to come in a single dose. Joe had been seeing a lot of him lately, andwas being brought into private consultation.
I thought you told me you werent in thewar. So bit by bit he got theconfidence of the wilder elements without scaring the moderates. I am not so sure that Utlaw hasnone, either. I hope not, but the temptation will be great, and I think too wellof him to want him on our side. If there is, you wont mend it by any of the old-fashionedappeals.
One afternoon Adam went to call on Mrs Utlaw.
The church wascrowded, and Franks sermons to his disgust were reported in thepopular London press. So bit by bit he got theconfidence of the wilder elements without scaring the moderates. Well, Ill give you the benefit of my largerknowledge.
We are in dangerof splitting into nebul of whirling atoms.
Also he could leave thehouse inconspicuously at odd hours without distracting Mrs Gallop. It is only an accident whether it works behind thescenes or on the stage.

NEW YORK, /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  -  Art4Love  announced today that it plans to

portal  site  in the U.S., and according  to Hitwise, MySpace may now claim the
number one spot for  all  Internet visits in the U.S. Art4Love plans to use the
strength of MySpace to establish new relationships between artists and patrons.
Art4Love used Myspace.com  technology to establish  a profile page."Introducing
Art4Love to MySpace will  let potential  fine artists,  art lovers and industry
experts experience the talent of our innovative artists from around the world,"
said  Chad  Love Lieberman  CEO  of  Art4Love Inc.  "The ability for artists to
personally  interact  with  Art4Love  will  significantly  enhance the value of
Art4Love's  online  marketing  campaigns.  Our objective is to continue to grow
Art4Love  into a  complete,  internationally recognized Art Company," Lieberman
added.                                                          
"Art4Love is well known for its innovation. We would not be at all surprised to
see  our  competitors,  like  Getty Images, Jupiter Media and Corbis attempt to
copy what we have created with the help of MySpace."

I nfinex Ve ntures, I n c . (OTCBB: I N F X.P K) ("the Company") is pleased to
announce that it is in negotiations to acquire an interest in the Bolivar
Property located on Texada Island, British Columbia, Canada. The
Property consists of 23 adjacent mineral claims and 2 crown grants centered
approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) west of the town of Vananda, B.C.
Previous drilling programs have outlined a significant resource with a high
concentration of gold. One diamond drill hole across the zone returned
a one-foot (0.3 m) intersection assaying 20.83 oz/ton Gold (714.9 g/t
Gold).
                                                                                                                                                            
Trenching, diamond drilling and bulk test sampling of the Bolivar
deposit has revealed numerous spectacular "streaks and stringers" of free
gold in graphitic shear zones. As per Assessment Report 16789, a 1733
tonne bulk sample from the Bolivar pit returned a total of 1039.19 grams
of gold. Infinex's pending acquisition of the Bolivar Property is a
strategic one that, along with the Company's interest in the Yew Property,
will provide it with control of a substantial portion of the mining
properties and reserves on Texada Island. Infinex intends to finalize this
acquisition by the end of September.

We are calling on all people who believe in the freedom of the Cuban 5, to

The New York Times, and to join us in requesting that a reporter be assigned
to write an article on the Cuban 5.

We ask that you either download the PDF and fax it to the number on the
letter (212-556-7614) or cut/paste the email letter below and send it to
national@...&lt;http://by120fd.bay120.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/compose?mailto=1&amp;msg=B6B3B03F-B925-41EE-838C-5AC3F82D6F22&amp;start=0&amp;len=167192&amp;src=&amp;type=x&amp;to=national@...&amp;cc=&amp;bcc=&amp;subject=&amp;body=&amp;curmbox=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;a=70b6a8f3468f19094dee7ff0b607debc56983d9eabf953e9dda4675d4d7e57bc&gt;

To Suzanne Daley:

On September 12th, 1998, Fernando Gonzalez Llort, Ramon Labaino Salazar,
Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez, Rene Gonzalez Sehweret, and Gerardo Hernandez
Nordelo, known throughout the world as the Cuban 5, were arrested and then
charged by the U.S. government with a series of offenses, the most serious
being conspiracy, the favored charge of prosecutors when they have no
evidence that a crime occurred.

In actuality, the Cuban 5 infiltrated Cuban-American right-wing terrorist
organizations based in Miami to monitor their actions.  The Cuban 5
infiltrated these organizations to protect the national sovereignty of their
homeland Cuba and to safeguard the American populous from terrorist actions
within the United States.  The information they gathered was shared by Cuba
with U.S. officials.

With a trial based in Miami, it was impossible for the Cuban 5 to receive a
fair trial. The proceedings were threatened by Cuban American right wing
terrorist organizations, leading defense counsel to make  motions for a
change of venue, which were denied.  The judge, prosecution and U.S.
government officials suppressed defense evidence and  made sure that key
witnesses for the defense would not testify.   It was found that the
information that the Cuban 5 had amassed was not government classified, but
public information that did not threaten national security.  Yet in June
2001, they were found guilty of  espionage and threatening national
security.

For the past 8 years an international movement of support, comprised of
Nobel Laureates and leading human rights activists, has developed to demand
the release of these five innocent men.  In fact the Working Group on
Arbitration Detentions of the U.N. Human Rights Commission adopted a
resolution in which they concluded that the Cuban 5's incarceration was
arbitrary and recommended the U.S. government rectify the situation.  On
August 9th, 2005, a three-judge panel of the 11th circuit court of appeals
overturned their convictions and called for a retrial.  Unfortunately, a
year later on August 9th, 2006, the full 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta, Georgia, with two judges dissenting, rejected the decision made
by the three-judge panel.

For the past eight years, the issue of the Cuban 5 has been ignored by the
U.S. media; with the exception of articles written by the Washington Post
(May 2006), L.A. Times (August 2006), and The Daily News (September 2006).
The period of time between September 12-Oct.6th has been designated by the
support network as a time to raise awareness about the Cuban 5 and their
case.  An article in The New York Times would help educate thousands of
people about these innocent men.

Therefore, I respectfully ask that a reporter of the New York Times contact
a representative of The Popular Education Project to the Free the Cuban 5, a
New York based initiative in support of the Cuban 5, at 718-601-4751 and
conduct an interview; the Project will also provide additional contacts for
interviews.   The Cuban 5 is far too important of an issue for the New York
Times to ignore.

Sincerely,

Name

We�re going to be speaking with Roberto Mucaro Borrero, the President &amp; 
Chairman, THE UNITED CONFEDERATION OF TA�NO PEOPLE (UCTP) Regional 
Coordinating Office.  Briefly, the UCTP is an international coalition of 
Caribbean Indigenous Peoples dedicated to the promotion, and protection of 
the cultural heritage and spiritual traditions of their aboriginal ancestors 
for their present and future generations.

Since this weekend we are going to be commemorating another Columbus Day, 
the only holiday disputed in 17 states because it commemorates the life of a 
mass murder and slave master, we in DB think it is important that we touch 
base with our indigenous family and hear about the work they are doing. 
We're going to talk about the work of the UCTP and their support of the 
Declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples.

Chairman, THE UNITED CONFEDERATION OF TA�NO PEOPLE (UCTP) Regional 
Coordinating Office.  Briefly, the UCTP is an international coalition of 
Caribbean Indigenous Peoples dedicated to the promotion, and protection of 
the cultural heritage and spiritual traditions of their aboriginal ancestors 
for their present and future generations.

Since this weekend we are going to be commemorating another Columbus Day, 
the only holiday disputed in 17 states because it commemorates the life of a 
mass murder and slave master, we in DB think it is important that we touch 
base with our indigenous family and hear about the work they are doing. 
We're going to talk about the work of the UCTP and their support of the 
Declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples.

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 is proud to announce our
newest campaign; "The Free the Cuban 5 New York Times Campaign"

We are calling on all people who believe in the freedom of the Cuban 5, to
read the letter we have written to Suzanne Daley, National News Editor of
The New York Times, and to join us in requesting that a reporter be assigned
to write an article on the Cuban 5.

We ask that you either download the PDF and fax it to the number on the
letter (212-556-7614) or cut/paste the email letter below and send it to
national@...&lt;http://by120fd.bay120.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/compose?mailto=1&amp;msg=F55BACDD-4616-4076-AE90-A3C67E2589F4&amp;start=0&amp;len=167249&amp;src=&amp;type=x&amp;to=national@...&amp;cc=&amp;bcc=&amp;subject=&amp;body=&amp;curmbox=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&amp;a=70b6a8f3468f19094dee7ff0b607debcf4da2633b54f89927150eb5c5bd9b026&gt;

The idea is to bombard their fax machines and their email account until we
see an article in the New York Times.  Forward this email to everyone you
know!!

To Suzanne Daley:

On September 12th, 1998, Fernando Gonzalez Llort, Ramon Labaino Salazar,
Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez, Rene Gonzalez Sehweret, and Gerardo Hernandez
Nordelo, known throughout the world as the Cuban 5, were arrested and then
charged by the U.S. government with a series of offenses, the most serious
being conspiracy, the favored charge of prosecutors when they have no
evidence that a crime occurred.

In actuality, the Cuban 5 infiltrated Cuban-American right-wing terrorist
organizations based in Miami to monitor their actions.  The Cuban 5
infiltrated these organizations to protect the national sovereignty of their
homeland Cuba and to safeguard the American populous from terrorist actions
within the United States.  The information they gathered was shared by Cuba
with U.S. officials.

With a trial based in Miami, it was impossible for the Cuban 5 to receive a
fair trial. The proceedings were threatened by Cuban American right wing
terrorist organizations, leading defense counsel to make  motions for a
change of venue, which were denied.  The judge, prosecution and U.S.
government officials suppressed defense evidence and  made sure that key
witnesses for the defense would not testify.   It was found that the
information that the Cuban 5 had amassed was not government classified, but
public information that did not threaten national security.  Yet in June
2001, they were found guilty of  espionage and threatening national
security.

For the past 8 years an international movement of support, comprised of
Nobel Laureates and leading human rights activists, has developed to demand
the release of these five innocent men.  In fact the Working Group on
Arbitration Detentions of the U.N. Human Rights Commission adopted a
resolution in which they concluded that the Cuban 5's incarceration was
arbitrary and recommended the U.S. government rectify the situation.  On
August 9th, 2005, a three-judge panel of the 11th circuit court of appeals
overturned their convictions and called for a retrial.  Unfortunately, a
year later on August 9th, 2006, the full 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta, Georgia, with two judges dissenting, rejected the decision made
by the three-judge panel.

For the past eight years, the issue of the Cuban 5 has been ignored by the
U.S. media; with the exception of articles written by the Washington Post
(May 2006), L.A. Times (August 2006), and The Daily News (September 2006).
The period of time between September 12-Oct.6th has been designated by the
support network as a time to raise awareness about the Cuban 5 and their
case.  An article in The New York Times would help educate thousands of
people about these innocent men.

Therefore, I respectfully ask that a reporter of the New York Times contact
a representative of The Popular Education Project to the Free the Cuban 5, a

New York based initiative in support of the Cuban 5, at 718-601-4751 and
conduct an interview; the Project will also provide additional contacts for
interviews.   The Cuban 5 is far too important of an issue for the New York
Times to ignore.

Sincerely,

<pre>Are you looking for a simple investment strategy that beats more than 90% of all mutual funds and investment newsletters?

It takes as little as 15 minutes a month to get these results using the Vega Stock Forecast

The Vega Stock Forecast is a stock research report that is published on this website around the 10th of each month. Each month, our computer models use artificial intelligence technologies and fundamental data to analyze the market from the top-down. We present two investment systems, one using mutual funds, and one using stocks.

For every $10,000 invested on January 10, 1992, our smart computer's stock picks would have given you $126,458 by October 10, 2006 versus only $32,275 if you had been invested in the S&amp;P 500 stock index.

You could be 50% richer or 50% poorer by next year depending on which stock market industries you invest in.

Our methods help you to find the best industries.

<pre>The great predictions are made. 
The increase is up to 70% lately.
(MXXR) is the worthwhile deal and those who knows it is making money.
The drilling achivements of this highly capable oil company exceeded all its expectations. 
Once this fact hits the road there will be no stopping this one.
these days it's about 0.022 but we are expecting it to triple. 
Once the press release is made and the PR gets into full swing.
Don't waste time and miss out.  We counsel you to buy today.
The key is getting in early and the time is pressing. They say that Monday is the day it will detonate. Take your place 
before that happens.

<pre>The first thing to do in tuesday is to get in on EQTD. It will RISE
up next days.  There will be more than 100%
appreciation within the first few hours, so do it fast .

With oil markets retreating, big traders are turning to
gold, driving it to levels never before seen.  EQTD has
made an notice of staggering proportions related to a
recent survey on one of their gold ownership.  The internal
scoop is that we will be looking at a quadrupling of stock-exchange quotation once the public takes notice:

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS-(MARKETWIRE)-Oct 23, 2006 - Equal trading
is pleased to announce advertisement results which have far
exceeded expectations. The results from our British
Columbia property show 58,000 ounce potential.  Plans are
already underway for urgent development.  We look
forward to this extraordinary discovery bringing value to
our shareholders.

At 600$ an ounce this finding is worth 34.8 mil$.  With
865mil shares outstanding, this would give us a book value
of 0.04 (current price is under 1 cent).

Don't let it pass you by. The value and the opportunity are there.
Nowadays is the lowest price it can be.
It's high time to buy in! The profitable moment to invest!
Real promotion  will help you to sell it with higher price later.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- ExxonMobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company and the biggest corporation by revenue, reported on Thursday the second largest profit ever.
RIVERSIDE, Calif. (CNN) -- Three firefighters were killed and two were injured Thursday battling a wildfire near Palm Springs that has burned about 4,000 acres and forced mandatory evacuations, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Bill Sap.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- New home prices took their biggest hit in more than 35 years in September, the government said Thursday, the latest sign that builders are struggling to unload a glut of unsold homes as the nation's real estate market cools.
ORANGE COUNTY, California (CNN) -- On October 12, Ruben Navarrette Jr. penned a pompous commentary for CNN.com ("Minutemen have a right to be idiotic"). His litany of name-calling and bogus accusations against The Minuteman Project membership places him solidly in the category of propagandist journalists who "spin" their stories to suit their bias -- valid facts and objectivity be damned.

Unfortunately, Microsoft has misunderstood how the GPL works, and where it stands on the issue of patents, if one gives Microsoft every benefit of every doubt.
So, would that mean that if  there could be a sudden change of control or a decision to pay dividends to common stockholders, he'd already have a little pocket change?
Anyone able to make sense of this gobbledygook? Think about whether that is the patent policy you really want, and if it isn't, you need to change it.
Obviously nobody in the FOSS community. You can't ask for royalties on GPL code. Jonathan Schwartz is saying that Eben and Richard Stallman were stunned when Sun called them.
But when you see a party suddenly shifting strategies in the middle of the stream and heading back in the opposite direction, it usually means they are afraid of drowning. That is a no no, so she ruled that the evidence that wasn't on the table with sufficient specificity, as ordered,  by the discovery cutoff deadline could not be used by SCO. And since some of you may be planning to attend, I wanted to let you know. But it's not a patent cross license.
It tickles my funny bone to see SCO on the receiving end of discovery motions to compel.
Something may have turned up in discovery, making SCO want to cut discovery short after all.
It's also why Linux development was so much faster than proprietary software development ever can be. Why did they choose GPL? There obviously was no meeting of the minds. At Microsoft we undertook our own analysis of our patent portfolio and concluded that it was necessary and important to create a patent covenant for customers of these products. The parties stipulated to the change and asked for it, so that is the reason.
A truly great day, indeed. In any case, the deal is falling apart, I'd say.
He is reviewing the actual agreement. It tickles my funny bone to see SCO on the receiving end of discovery motions to compel.
And the threat works even if the patent is bogus.
Unfortunately, Microsoft has misunderstood how the GPL works, and where it stands on the issue of patents, if one gives Microsoft every benefit of every doubt. At least that's what they taught me in my class on contract law. Microsoft didn't have to deal with them when it was building its business, but now it has them in hand to try to bully Linux, the better mousetrap that endangers its monopoly,  to death. Give me money for my patent or I'll break your kneecaps.
In fact, it isn't a license at all, because that would violate the GPL too.

WE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED!
DEFEND FR. LUIS BARRIOS AND GEOFF MILLARD!
UPHOLD THE RIGHT TO PROTEST!

Fr. Luis Barrios and Iraq vet Geoff Millard were arrested on
September 19 along with 14 others outside the United Nations as GeorgeW.
Bush was speaking. They had come with this common message: "We have come to
the United Nations today to engage in non-violent civil disobedience. We
demand the war on Iraq end immediately. We
oppose any attack on Iran. We declare to the world that President George W.
Bush has been found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He
does not speak for us."

When the group organized by the Bush Crimes Commission unfurled theirsigns,
police grabbed Fr. Barrios first and forced him to the ground. He was
subsequently charged with assaulting a police officer (a felony), resisting
arrest, and disorderly conduct.

Geoff Millard was knocked over by police while hand-cuffed. They then
declared that he was "resistant" and he was charged with resisting arrest.
All the others arrested had the charges of disorderly conduct against them
dropped.

It is important that everyone come to the defense of Fr. Barrios because of
his long history of support for the struggles of the people, and Geoff
Millard, who is an activist member of the Iraq Veterans Against the War and
has been featured on Truthout.org. Both are innocent.

We must uphold the right of the people to protest. No
president should be allowed to deny protest around their public appearances.
We will not be cowed into remaining silent in the face of crimes against
humanity.

Here is what you can do to defend Fr. Barrios and Geoff Millard: Fill the
courtroom at Fr. Barrios's court appearance, December 11, 2006 at 100 Centre
Street, Part F.

Be there before 8:30 am. On January 16, 2007 fill the courtroom for Geoff
Millard at the same address, Part B.

Call or write your protest of his prosecution to Manhattan District Attorney
Robert M. Morgenthau at (212) 335-9000 or One Hogan Place, New York, NY

com, which is betting on a vision similar to Amazon's. When Daffy shows him the safe way, a flashlight, the oven explodes on him. A spike in demand might cause a supplier to change shipping schedules or notice buying trends based on industry or geography. COBRA is expensive: you are paying full value on a group policy whose costs used to be shared by your former employer. However, more and more companies are seeing the light, Woollen notes. why should you have all the headaches? Better yet, make your son do it.
They could be if you ask users and industry analysts who participated in several panels at Storage Networking World this week. If so, then putting the rest of the family under that umbrella will very likely cost far less than continuing your COBRA coverage.
After seeing all of Daffy's accidents, Porky decides to buy the policy after all.
A spike in demand might cause a supplier to change shipping schedules or notice buying trends based on industry or geography. At first glance, a push into VoIP may seem odd for a company that recently threw in the towel on another communications business.
We are looking to move away from managing bits, bytes and blocks of data, and deploying software, technology and standards that can manage the grid as a single entity.
Until then, the smart ones take steps to look after their own interests. services are delivered by driving out as much of the needed customization as possible in order to deliver standardized network and communication service products to its clients.
Is there any way to include my oldest daughter on our plan? If not, then pat yourself on the back: you're ahead of the game. ITunes is no help, but several third-party software options can help you reclaim full control of your digital music library.

Daffy, wearing a straw hat and oversized neck tie, knocks on Porky Pig's door and tries to sell him an insurance policy.

Having them stumble through an unfamiliar system and end up inputting poor data is the last thing a call center manager wants to hear. The name of an insurance policy may identify its general category of coverage, but is pretty much worthless regarding the specifics.

This picture was from the E-Bay ad.
Someone at Headquarters had a bee in his bonnet that white bikes would be safer than black ones.
Some considerable damage to the bike which I have repaired, with the exception of a small ding in the front left side of the tank and replacing the front guard with a non standard.
Someone at Headquarters had a bee in his bonnet that white bikes would be safer than black ones. As expected from Honda, this engine is quite a precision mechanism constructed of only the highest quality materials including modern alloys. I slowly painted things and rebuilt the engine and it turned out to be a pretty good looking bike.
The pump forced lubrication system with two seperate filters enables the engine to move at such high speeds without under wear. Fresh cold air vents in front of door hinges. Bought her new and still have her. Note rear leaf springs. It is the condition in which nobody in the world is lost.
Yes it did hurt, wish the bikes healed up like we do.
Still lots to do before she is perfect.
Had this one imported, it started second kick when pulled from the crate, two month old Japanese fuel and all. It is definitely not a race bike, my opinion, but Honda did build at least a prototype based on this engine.
As you can clearly see it was time to get it the hell out of there!
I slowly painted things and rebuilt the engine and it turned out to be a pretty good looking bike.
She takes some looking after but she is well worth it. The best of both worlds. As you can clearly see it was time to get it the hell out of there! New Laminated windscreen.
What wonderful machines. The quantum leap in technology was staggering. It is the condition in which nobody in the world is lost. Superb performance and superior reliability are the result.
Suprisingly, the experts came to the conclusion that the black bike was easier to spot in daylight and dark.
Note rear leaf springs.
Yes it did hurt, wish the bikes healed up like we do.

" People are basically afraid that if they give to God and others that they'll come out on the short end of the stick and their stick is pretty short to begin with. In a similar way, God has designed you with imperfections and weaknesses. But do this with gentleness and respect.
He has created a universe with hundreds of billions of galaxies, each one containing up to a trillion stars. Hattersley was right that serving others is a mark of a believer. The answer is that when you understand how God created you, you are much closer to figuring out what you were created to do.
See if your life doesn't change for the better, don't be afraid just jump in. God is interested in your actions of service and He is also interested in your attitudes behind your actions, both are incredibly important.
In a place called El Fortin, witnesses report how police were beating up and torturing detained ones before moving them from the spot aboard pickup trucks.
All of my messages from this year are available in audio form on our website, if you'd like to listen to them.
Dear Pastor,May God continue to be with you. Though, the police threw a lot of tear-gas which was spread all over the city centre, while undercover policemen brutally wallopped a young student and then they arrested him.
God put you together in a unique pattern. The betrothal usually occurred a year before the finalization of the marriage and of course there was to be no intimacy before that time was over. It takes a scientist to decifer the wording of the amendment.
It makes a great amount of sense when you say, "When do we decide when it is a baby? Supported by the NAACP, NLG, UK Lawyers, and The German Parliament, Philly Journalists Linn Washington and Dave Lindorff have optimistically written of Abu-Jamal's chances for a new trial.
Serving God begins in the mind. " Are you a follower of Jesus Christ?
Let's see how the Bible says you should talk to others about Jesus. They were then able to speak to the Congressman via speakerphone. In the weeks leading to this year's demonstrations mass media had been creating an atmosphere of fear, in a concious attempt to limit the public's participation to them. Today I want to further answer the question, How can you use your unique SHAPE to serve God? Other protest activities around the city inclu The guide that we have to tell us what choice to make is the Bible.
Three people were shot by police from two pickup trucks using heavy gunfire near the College of Medicine. I trust that this blog will give you a glimpse of the truth about what's important in life.
On our way into town we past a military checkpoint at the turn-off to the airport.
"No wonder voters are confused.
Your interpretation of the Bible does not make any sense to me. They have also coined a new term "early stem cell research" to avoid the term "embryonic.
Of course, I'll tell everyone that I wasn't one that thought of the quote.
How would you respond? You are born into a new world where your sins are forgiven and your guilt is gone. There is no disagreement among evangelical Bible-believing denominations, churches and ministries on this issue. So, if you consider yourself foolish, if you consider yourself powerless, there's good news. However, experts tell us that a perfectly smooth golf ball would only travel about half the distance as the ball "flawed" with dimples. Serving others needs to come from a heart of love, from thoughts motivated by God's Spirit.

<pre> Hello! Last time you've asked me about Canadian pharmacy shops.
After some researches I can surely say that MyCanadianPharmacy
drug store sells high-quality medications only. There is no need to be
aware of quality. Their medications are the same we have here in USA.
But they give us opportunity to buy these meds at lower prices.

I recommend to buy medications at their drug store!
