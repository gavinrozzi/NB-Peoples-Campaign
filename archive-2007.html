&gt; Hey All Ladies,
&gt;
&gt; Funky Ladies' Night was supposed to be at 218 townsend tonight.  But,
&gt; I'm very sorry, we cannot have it at 218.  If we'd like to reschedule
&gt; (which I personally would, since no one really knew about tonight, and
&gt; I have the LSAT's tomorrow;)  cool.  Otherwise, we must find another
&gt; venue.  Sorry about the last minute/inconvenience.  It's just we've had
&gt; craziness at our house every weekend for the last month and a half, and
&gt; when I talked with my roommates we all felt we needed a weekend off.
&gt; I'll be happy to make calls or whatever is necessary when I get home
&gt; from work.  But someone needs to make a decision as to what is
&gt; happening. Again, I'm sorry, Gals.
&gt;
&gt; Julie

LADIES' NIGHT IS ON!!!

7:30 TONIGHT, OCT 6TH
AT MY PLACE, 702 MAGNOLIA ST IN HIGHLAND PARK

PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THE SUDDEN CHANGE OF VENUE.

Directions:  
1. Take Raritan Avenue (which is the same as Route 27) over the bridge into Highland Park.  
2. Turn right at Third Ave (actually you could turn right at any of the numbered streets, it's just that at Fifth it forks, so you would have to bear right before turning right).  
3. Make the first left onto Magnolia St and it's a few blocks down between Seventh and Eighth.

For more info, call me at 339-1347 or 762-4047.

��FELIZ A�O NUEVO!! HAPPYY NEW YEAR!!

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign wishes everyone a wonderful, just and 
powerful New Year!!  In these times of war, repression and RESISITANCE, we 
in the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign are calling on all our allies, 
supporters and friends to remember our brothers and sisters behind the 
walls!! Those amazing and inspiration compa�er@s that were incarcerated by 
the US government for their brave actions and commitment to the liberation 
of Puerto Rico; a colony of the United States for 108 years!!

As the year 2007 begins, we are urging all of you to join ProLibertad's 
newest campaign: ADOPT-A-PRISONER 2007.

to him/her/them once or twice a month.

Step 3: If you can, send them a commissary donation (small financial 
donation $5-whatever; every little bit counts)!!  These small donations 
allow them to pay for phone calls to family/LEGAL COUNSEL/friends and also 
for over priced materials behind the walls.  To learn more about how to 
donate to them go to: http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page5.html

Step 4:  Email us Prolibertad@... and let us know who you've 
adopted.  We want to  keep track of this campaign and see how many of you

��FELIZ A�O NUEVO!! HAPPYY NEW YEAR!!

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign wishes everyone a wonderful, just and
powerful New Year!!  In these times of war, repression and RESISITANCE, we
in the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign are calling on all our allies,
supporters and friends to remember our brothers and sisters behind the
walls!! Those amazing and inspiration compa�er@s that were incarcerated by
the US government for their brave actions and commitment to the liberation
of Puerto Rico; a colony of the United States for 108 years!!

As the year 2007 begins, we are urging all of you to join ProLibertad's
newest campaign: ADOPT-A-PRISONER 2007.

This is an easy project.  There are only 5 easy steps to support this
endeavor:

Step 1:  Go our website: http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page4.html and read
about one of our prisoners.

Step 2:  Choose one of them or all of them and make the commitment to write
to him/her/them once or twice a month.

Step 3: If you can, send them a commissary donation (small financial
donation $5-whatever; every little bit counts)!!  These small donations
allow them to pay for phone calls to family/LEGAL COUNSEL/friends and also
for over priced materials behind the walls.  To learn more about how to
donate to them go to: http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page5.html

Step 4:  Email us Prolibertad@... and let us know who you've
adopted.  We want to  keep track of this campaign and see how many of you
are able to commit to supporting our prisoners.

��FELIZ A�O NUEVO!! HAPPYY NEW YEAR!!

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign wishes everyone a wonderful, just and
powerful New Year!!  In these times of war, repression and RESISITANCE, we
in the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign are calling on all our allies,
supporters and friends to remember our brothers and sisters behind the
walls!! Those amazing and inspiration compa�er@s that were incarcerated by
the US government for their brave actions and commitment to the liberation
of Puerto Rico; a colony of the United States for 108 years!!

As the year 2007 begins, we are urging all of you to join ProLibertad's
newest campaign: ADOPT-A-PRISONER 2007.

This is an easy project.  There are only 5 easy steps to support this
endeavor:

Step 1:  Go our website: http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page4.html and read
about one of our prisoners.

Step 2:  Choose one of them or all of them and make the commitment to write
to him/her/them once or twice a month.

Step 3: If you can, send them a commissary donation (small financial
donation $5-whatever; every little bit counts)!!  These small donations
allow them to pay for phone calls to family/LEGAL COUNSEL/friends and also
for over priced materials behind the walls.  To learn more about how to
donate to them go to: http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page5.html

Step 4:  Email us Prolibertad@... and let us know who you've
adopted.  We want to  keep track of this campaign and see how many of you
are able to commit to supporting our prisoners.

Step 5: Motivate all of your friends to ADOPT-TO-A-PRISONER!! Be creative!!
Invite ProLibertad to speak to your friends or organize a card/letter
writing party.  Let us know how we can support!!

It is very simple!!

TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE FREEDOM HAPPEN!!  TOGETHER WE CAN SUPPORT OUR HEROES

��FELIZ A�O NUEVO!! HAPPYY NEW YEAR!!

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign wishes everyone a wonderful, just and
powerful New Year!!  In these times of war, repression and RESISITANCE, we
in the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign are calling on all our allies,
supporters and friends to remember our brothers and sisters behind the
walls!! Those amazing and inspiration compa�er@s that were incarcerated by
the US government for their brave actions and commitment to the liberation
of Puerto Rico; a colony of the United States for 108 years!!

As the year 2007 begins, we are urging all of you to join ProLibertad's
newest campaign: ADOPT-A-PRISONER 2007.

This is an easy project.  There are only 5 easy steps to support this
endeavor:

Step 1:  Go our website: http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page4.html and read
about one of our prisoners.

Step 2:  Choose one of them or all of them and make the commitment to write
to him/her/them once or twice a month.

Step 3: If you can, send them a commissary donation (small financial
donation $5-whatever; every little bit counts)!!  These small donations
allow them to pay for phone calls to family/LEGAL COUNSEL/friends and also
for over priced materials behind the walls.  To learn more about how to
donate to them go to: http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page5.html

Step 4:  Email us Prolibertad@... and let us know who you've
adopted.  We want to  keep track of this campaign and see how many of you
are able to commit to supporting our prisoners.

Step 5: Motivate all of your friends to ADOPT-TO-A-PRISONER!! Be creative!!
Invite ProLibertad to speak to your friends or organize a card/letter
writing party.  Let us know how we can support!!

It is very simple!!

TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE FREEDOM HAPPEN!!  TOGETHER WE CAN SUPPORT OUR HEROES 
BEHINDTHE WALLS!!

VISIT TO OSPAAAL BY INDEPENDENCE FIGHTER RAFAEL CANEL MIRANDA

�I will give my life for Fidel Castro and for Cuba�, declared distinguished 
Puerto Rican independence fighter, Rafael Cancel Miranda, during a fraternal 
meeting that he had on January 12th with members of the Executive 
Secretariat of the Organization for Solidarity with the Peoples of Africa, 
Asia and Latin America (OSPAAAL) and with representatives of parties, 
movements and political organizations in Cuba.

Cancel Miranda addressed the current situation in Puerto Rico, especially 
focusing on the worsening living conditions faced by the poorest sectors of 
the population due to the increase in the cost of basic services, 
privatization, and the increase in taxes carried out in order to reduce the 
debts owed to the U.S. metropolis.  This entire situation has provoked a new 
exodus of Puerto Ricans to the United States.   The independence fighter 
said that the United States has transformed Puerto Rico into a laboratory 
for its neoliberal policies.

�The local authorities in Puerto Rico have no real power, the true 
government is in Washington�, said Cancel, who also stated that the Puerto 
Rican courts totally subordinate themselves to their counterparts in north 
american territory.  He also pointed toward the sad fact that a group of 
Puerto Rican military personnel is serving at the U.S. Naval Base in 
Guant�namo as jailers for the prisoners that are being held their illegally.

Cancel Miranda reiterated that he will refuse to use any document for 
purposes of identification or passport that is imposed by the north american 
authorities given that this would be recognizing as legal the U.S. 
intervention in his country.   He expressed his gratitude for the unwavering 
solidarity of the government, party and people of Cuba with the cause of 
Puerto Rican independence and warned that as long as his country is a colony 
the independence and freedom of the rest of the countries of the continent 
would be threatened.

Lourdes Cervantes, Director of the Political Department of the OSPAAAL, 
expressed her gratitude for the visit of the independence leader and 
presented a gift of the poster of Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, to Don 
Rafael.  This poster was recently made by the OSPAAAL to commemorate the 
80th birthday of the Comandante of the Cuban Revolution.

VISIT TO OSPAAAL BY INDEPENDENCE FIGHTER RAFAEL CANEL MIRANDA

�I will give my life for Fidel Castro and for Cuba�, declared distinguished 
Puerto Rican independence fighter, Rafael Cancel Miranda, during a fraternal 
meeting that he had on January 12th with members of the Executive 
Secretariat of the Organization for Solidarity with the Peoples of Africa, 
Asia and Latin America (OSPAAAL) and with representatives of parties, 
movements and political organizations in Cuba.

Cancel Miranda addressed the current situation in Puerto Rico, especially 
focusing on the worsening living conditions faced by the poorest sectors of 
the population due to the increase in the cost of basic services, 
privatization, and the increase in taxes carried out in order to reduce the 
debts owed to the U.S. metropolis.  This entire situation has provoked a new 
exodus of Puerto Ricans to the United States.   The independence fighter 
said that the United States has transformed Puerto Rico into a laboratory 
for its neoliberal policies.

�The local authorities in Puerto Rico have no real power, the true 
government is in Washington�, said Cancel, who also stated that the Puerto 
Rican courts totally subordinate themselves to their counterparts in north 
american territory.  He also pointed toward the sad fact that a group of 
Puerto Rican military personnel is serving at the U.S. Naval Base in 
Guant�namo as jailers for the prisoners that are being held their illegally.

Cancel Miranda reiterated that he will refuse to use any document for 
purposes of identification or passport that is imposed by the north american 
authorities given that this would be recognizing as legal the U.S. 
intervention in his country.   He expressed his gratitude for the unwavering 
solidarity of the government, party and people of Cuba with the cause of 
Puerto Rican independence and warned that as long as his country is a colony 
the independence and freedom of the rest of the countries of the continent 
would be threatened.

Lourdes Cervantes, Director of the Political Department of the OSPAAAL, 
expressed her gratitude for the visit of the independence leader and 
presented a gift of the poster of Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, to Don 
Rafael.  This poster was recently made by the OSPAAAL to commemorate the 
80th birthday of the Comandante of the Cuban Revolution.

powerful New Year!! In these times of war, repression and RESISITANCE, we in 
the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign are calling on all our allies, supporters 
and friends to remember our brothers and sisters behind the walls!! Those 
amazing and inspiration compa�er@s that were incarcerated by the US

The Bureau of Prisons� Twisted Holiday Gift to Oscar L�pez Rivera

By Laura Ruth Johnson

January 17, 2007

Having been involved with the issue of Puerto Rican political prisoners for 
nearly 15 years, I have learned to expect, and be prepared for, just about 
every type of injustice and maltreatment. But what happened on Saturday 
December 29, when I attempted to take Karina L�pez to visit her grandfather, 
Oscar L�pez Rivera, who is incarcerated at USP Terre Haute, reached a new 
level of abuse. We were denied visitation because I failed an ion scan, used 
to determine any contact with trace narcotic elements. I tested positive for 
THC, or marijuana. Although Karina was not tested (the tests are performed 
randomly) she was essentially barred from visiting because she is a minor 
and cannot visit unaccompanied. This was an annual holiday visit and Karina 
had traveled from Puerto Rico to Chicago, IL; we had driven almost 4 hours 
from Chicago to Terre Haute, leaving at 4:30 am, only to immediately return 
home, our mission of spending time with �buelo Oscar unfulfilled.

It should be noted that the ion scans have been cited for producing false 
positives, and do not test your use of drugs but your contact with narcotic 
elements. The guards themselves acknowledge that use of cold medicine, 
cleaning solution, or cigarettes can result in a positive reading. Karina 
remembered a time when, after I tested positive 2 years ago, the guard 
mentioned that cat fur can trigger a positive reading.

On the way back Karina and I discussed our experiences off visiting. She has 
by far had to endure much more hardship associated with visiting than I 
have, as her paternal grandmother was incarcerated for 19 years and her 
maternal grandfather has now been imprisoned for over 25 years, and in some 
of the most punitive prisons in the country, such as Marion and Florence, 
where visits occur through glass. Each prison has its own rules, and they 
seem to be constantly changing, and sometimes arbitrarily enforced.

At Terre Haute, as in most prisons, there are rules for how you should 
dress�no open toed shoes, tank tops, hooded sweaters, short skirts, or khaki 
pants. You cannot bring in more than $20 and it should be in a plastic bag. 
You cannot bring in any pictures or personal items. You are assigned seating 
in uncomfortable plastic chairs in a row, so that you have to crane your 
neck to have a conversation. There can be no excessive touching, and 
prisoners have been disciplined for kissing their wives.

The ion scan has been instituted more recently than some of the other 
procedures, and has made the already difficult process of visiting prisons 
even more arduous. The night before you must select and wash your 
clothes�some even forgo using soap for fear of the chemicals. On the drive 
down, you are anxious regarding whether you will be allowed to visit. While 
in the waiting room, you watch others endure the test�essentially a vacuum 
used on the pockets of your clothes, your shoes, and your hands�and wonder 
if you will be selected randomly. You witness others �fail� the test and 
become upset, holding back tears, as I did a few days ago, and walk away. 
You leave feeling as if you have done something wrong or illicit and ask 
your self irrational questions: Did I not wash my shoes thoroughly? Did I 
wear this outfit after washing it? Could someone I know have �contaminated� 
my clothing or belongings? Nearly everyone I know has failed the ion scan at 
least once, and some twice. After the first positive in a one year period, 
you are unable to visit for 48 hours; the second positive has a 30 day 
penalty. A fourth positive would ban a person from visiting for 6 months.

Karina, whose experience and maturity far outnumbers her 15 years, put it 
this way in describing the rationale of the scans: It�s their way of telling 
us that �you are part of THIS now,� meaning that because of your 
relationship with a prisoner, you too will be criminalized. While it�s an 
effective means of reducing the numbers of visitors, it also works to make 
visitors feels as if they have committed a crime. Essentially it�s an 
additional form of oppression against prisoners and those who visit them. 
Such a procedure is all the more unjust when viewed in the context of the 
holidays, a time when most people �on the outside� spend time with friends 
and family, and visits are especially significant and meaningful.

Northern Illinois University. She has been a member of the National 
Committee to Free Puerto Rican Political Prisoners/National Boricua Human 
Rights Network since 1994.

��FELIZ A�O NUEVO!! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign wishes everyone a wonderful, just and 
powerful New Year!! In these times of war, repression and RESISITANCE, we in 
the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign are calling on all our allies, supporters 
and friends to remember our brothers and sisters behind the walls!! Those 
amazing and inspiration compa�er@s that were incarcerated by the US 
government for their brave actions and commitment to the liberation of 
Puerto Rico; a colony of the United States for 108 years!

As the year 2007 begins, we are urging all of you to join ProLibertad's 
newest campaign:

ADOPT-A-PRISONER 2007

This is an easy project. There are only 5 easy steps to support this 
endeavor:

Step 1: Go to http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page4.html and read about one of 
our prisoners.

Step 2: Choose one of them or all of them and make the commitment to write 
to him/her/them once or twice a month.

The Bureau of Prisons� Twisted Holiday Gift to Oscar L�pez Rivera

By Laura Ruth Johnson

January 17, 2007

Having been involved with the issue of Puerto Rican political prisoners for 
nearly 15 years, I have learned to expect, and be prepared for, just about 
every type of injustice and maltreatment. But what happened on Saturday 
December 29, when I attempted to take Karina L�pez to visit her grandfather, 
Oscar L�pez Rivera, who is incarcerated at USP Terre Haute, reached a new 
level of abuse. We were denied visitation because I failed an ion scan, used 
to determine any contact with trace narcotic elements. I tested positive for 
THC, or marijuana. Although Karina was not tested (the tests are performed 
randomly) she was essentially barred from visiting because she is a minor 
and cannot visit unaccompanied. This was an annual holiday visit and Karina 
had traveled from Puerto Rico to Chicago, IL; we had driven almost 4 hours 
from Chicago to Terre Haute, leaving at 4:30 am, only to immediately return 
home, our mission of spending time with �buelo Oscar unfulfilled.

It should be noted that the ion scans have been cited for producing false 
positives, and do not test your use of drugs but your contact with narcotic 
elements. The guards themselves acknowledge that use of cold medicine, 
cleaning solution, or cigarettes can result in a positive reading. Karina 
remembered a time when, after I tested positive 2 years ago, the guard 
mentioned that cat fur can trigger a positive reading.

On the way back Karina and I discussed our experiences off visiting. She has 
by far had to endure much more hardship associated with visiting than I 
have, as her paternal grandmother was incarcerated for 19 years and her 
maternal grandfather has now been imprisoned for over 25 years, and in some 
of the most punitive prisons in the country, such as Marion and Florence, 
where visits occur through glass. Each prison has its own rules, and they 
seem to be constantly changing, and sometimes arbitrarily enforced.

At Terre Haute, as in most prisons, there are rules for how you should 
dress�no open toed shoes, tank tops, hooded sweaters, short skirts, or khaki 
pants. You cannot bring in more than $20 and it should be in a plastic bag. 
You cannot bring in any pictures or personal items. You are assigned seating 
in uncomfortable plastic chairs in a row, so that you have to crane your 
neck to have a conversation. There can be no excessive touching, and 
prisoners have been disciplined for kissing their wives.

The ion scan has been instituted more recently than some of the other 
procedures, and has made the already difficult process of visiting prisons 
even more arduous. The night before you must select and wash your 
clothes�some even forgo using soap for fear of the chemicals. On the drive 
down, you are anxious regarding whether you will be allowed to visit. While 
in the waiting room, you watch others endure the test�essentially a vacuum 
used on the pockets of your clothes, your shoes, and your hands�and wonder 
if you will be selected randomly. You witness others �fail� the test and 
become upset, holding back tears, as I did a few days ago, and walk away. 
You leave feeling as if you have done something wrong or illicit and ask 
your self irrational questions: Did I not wash my shoes thoroughly? Did I 
wear this outfit after washing it? Could someone I know have �contaminated� 
my clothing or belongings? Nearly everyone I know has failed the ion scan at 
least once, and some twice. After the first positive in a one year period, 
you are unable to visit for 48 hours; the second positive has a 30 day 
penalty. A fourth positive would ban a person from visiting for 6 months.

Karina, whose experience and maturity far outnumbers her 15 years, put it 
this way in describing the rationale of the scans: It�s their way of telling 
us that �you are part of THIS now,� meaning that because of your 
relationship with a prisoner, you too will be criminalized. While it�s an 
effective means of reducing the numbers of visitors, it also works to make 
visitors feels as if they have committed a crime. Essentially it�s an 
additional form of oppression against prisoners and those who visit them. 
Such a procedure is all the more unjust when viewed in the context of the 
holidays, a time when most people �on the outside� spend time with friends 
and family, and visits are especially significant and meaningful.

Northern Illinois University. She has been a member of the National 
Committee to Free Puerto Rican Political Prisoners/National Boricua Human 
Rights Network since 1994.

Is it truly possible for a person to learn to like the jerks we all encounter on a daily basis?
RINGTONE TEST QUESTION: Do You Like To Dance? The guys over at the The Big Noob are working on a Dashboard widget for it that will make it even easier to view the stats with a nice clean GUI. The site has been thoroughly tested in Safari, Camino, OmniWeb, Firefox, Mozilla, IE 6, IE 5.
The majority of the songs have a futuristic, electronic style and a few are sing-songy melodies.
I just have never taken the time to actually sit down and learn all about how to do it, but I should.

Hers reads, "Could you give me a moment? The album contains a nice mix of songs that are similar to the Smashing Pumpkins, which is no surprise since he was the driving musical force behind the band.
I decided to let her stay busy with her life, and I moved on to talk to Marisa. But now I want you to be the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive The Smashing Pumpkins. Former leader of the Black Muslims, Malcolm X, is shot and killed in New York City.

If you have a problem getting or keeping an erection, 
your sexlife can suffer. You should know that you're not alone. 

In fact, more than half of all men over 40 have difficulties 
getting or maintaining an erection. This issue, also called 
erectile dysfunction, occurs with younger men as well.

Based on these models, we can anticipate the emerging role of biotechnology and nanotechnology on our health.
But in this century I think we are going to see some pretty dramatic changes. Forward it on, or post a copy to your favorite online communities. What's important is that research be allowed to continue so we can find out.
Massachusetts politicians are also under pressure to make their state more hospitable to stem cell research. phpUltimately, we should worry that politicians with the power to ban research will also turn to banning healthy life extension technologies, or even the right to research such medical advances.
Given my views on the value of education and advocacy for the largest possible audience, I would be happy to see more books like The Genomics Age on the shelves.
phpDiscussions were held, but it still looks like a vote could go either way.
" We'd all like this to work, but it's best to wait for confirmation from the wider scientific community before getting too excited.
Ronald Bailey weighs in on the current attempts to ban therapeutic cloning at the UN. When it comes to translating work on mice to work in humans, I suspect that you, I, and most other folks will be paying for the ability to slow or reverse aging in later life. The problem is, it's so healthy, that those of us outside California are pretty concerned.
Current research suggests that aging seems to be governed by interaction between the neurons in the brain and hormones such as insulin . "We have to keep in mind that looking forward thousands of years the evolution of the human species and whatever its descendents may become is pretty incalculable.
How about in comparison to the activities of Leon Kass and Francis Fukuyama of the President's Council on Bioethics?
" The work is from Elixir Pharmaceuticals, one of the companies currently pushing the aging research envelope. Click here to see how easy it is.
aspFuturist Ray Kurzweil discusses his views of the path to radical life extension over at PCWorld.
Venture capitalists tend to invest in clusters of related technologies, so we can hope to see similar efforts funded in the years ahead.
Private research initiatives probably represent a similar level of expenditure, but never get as much press.
" Knowledge is power in medical research - the more we have, the better our lives will be.
" I encourage you all to step up to the plate and make a donation that will help to invigorate serious anti-aging research!
I think we will see the indefinite suspension of ageing by the end of this century. Encourage the people you know to pitch in and make a difference to the future of health and longevity! Why Cryosuspension Makes Sense, Part 1Terry Grossman, M.
They give scientists an extraordinarily good look at a process that's fundamental to living organisms, from baker's yeast to humans: cell division.
htmlThere are two pieces of good news for embryonic stem cell science in this report from the The Australian. Newcastle Institute for Ageing and Health researchers have already made important contributions to our understanding of the aging process; we hope to see more of that in the future.

The unique targeting technology offered in this system is an important feature that allows our customers greater accuracy and precision in their field operations. Typically, wet areas on interior building surfaces are cooler by several degrees Fahrenheit than materially similar, but dry areas. Chronic condensation on organic building components is also conducive to mold growth. Then, when you read a headline that interests you, just click on it and you'll be able to read the full story.
Since our specials will change on a regular basis, everyone is encouraged to bookmark our store and visit often. By providing prospects with information, your sales force can spend less time educating prospects thereby freeing up valuable time for closing sales.
Individual pixels are arranged to form an array that ultimately allows the imager to produce a thermal image. ITC also offers a two-day class for supervisors and a one-day class for technicians.
Thermographers working outdoors in cold climates can face serious safety challenges due to frostbite and hypothermia. Additional revenue may be generated through participation in affiliate sales programs.
Thermographers working outdoors in cold climates can face serious safety challenges due to frostbite and hypothermia.
As you inspect high emittance building surfaces from the interior of the building, note any components that cause the isotherm to appear. When using an isotherm, be sure to practice proper measurement techniques giving particular consideration to viewing angle, spot measurement size and emissivity settings.
Should the requestor persist, the thermographer should decline to perform the inspection altogether.
RSS feeds can provide thermographers with up-to-the minute news and information on thermography and related PdM and NDT topics.
In addition, IR can monitor and track moisture migration paths within the wall cavity. As you inspect high emittance building surfaces from the interior of the building, note any components that cause the isotherm to appear. Fortunately, a thermal imager can be used to detect condensation problems before they become serious.
Symptoms of hypothermia include uncontrollable shivering, slow speech, memory lapses, frequent stumbling, drowsiness, and exhaustion.
These included ghosts on the monitor screen during shutdown, decreased processing speed, color palette changes, and factory defaults replacing my user-defined settings . Often the best approach is to hire a professional web designer to help you design, publish, and maintain your website.
Replacing parts is easy. The best footwear will have sturdy outers, good treads and a removable felt liner. During the previous two weeks, I had noticed several malfunctions. The yellow hot spot on this infrared thermal image of a door jamb indicates termite activity. When it comes to fall protection, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Perspiration is the main enemy of feet. When requested to improperly perform an infrared inspection, a professional thermographer has an obligation to inform interested parties of proper procedures. One of the definitions of RSS is "Really Simple Syndication".

Message:<br><br>
<pre>
Artie said he's got nothing to report at this point.
He's got a lot of issues to work out. Howard wondered why so Gary told him it was a legal issue and they didn't want that in there.
Margot Kidder's name also came up but Paul said he was just teasing about all of those names.
Howard said he didn't come up with those numbers, he just quoted what he was hearing.
He said that his first name, George, his middle name, Walker, and his Junior all have six letters so it's 666. Gary eventually found the number and tried calling.
He said it was just for concert tickets too, not even some huge prize.
Howard played the clip and the co-host asked Riley if the Aliens ever pimp out their space ships. Artie revealed that he and Dana had sex just 2 weeks ago after Ralph asked about it. Artie said he's got nothing to report at this point. He became reinvigorated when he moved to satellite and the writer heard that when he tuned in on Wednesday and Thursday. One of them has to be lying. Howard said that both Crazy Alice and Big Foot lost this weekend while Artie and Elliot won.
She also sent an e-mail in and talked about how fun it was there but then she complained about Howard and Robin's rude comments about the audience members.
Sal said that he feels bad about what he did to Beth and even apologized to Artie's sister for the comments he made about her. Paul wondered what happened to free speech in this country. Howard was going to let John Boy go but he wanted to ask Robin a question. Bob Levy Roasts Discussed.
She was barely able to speak and asked Gary to turn it down a little bit. 6:25amRiley Martin Show Clips.
8:45amComedian Tracy Morgan Visits.
He thinks that it's just the way the Republican's work.
Howard said they ended up getting kicked off up there even after they shot up to number one as soon as they started up there. Robin asked Paul about what he thinks about Bill Cosby going around and lecturing people about being good parents and stuff like that. Howard asked Artie what he did this weekend. Laura Doll Discussions. Artie's Dana issue was one of the subjects that Jon mentioned. He went up on stage and did some jokes about President Bush and he was later told that he was Bush hating and Bush bashing.
Paul talked about how crazy it is that the airports are taking make-up and shampoos from people. He did his impression of Artie's grandmother and made up a conversation she may have had with Artie about Dana. Riley went off on that guy for a short time rambling on as he usually does.

��FELIZ A�O NUEVO!! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign wishes everyone a wonderful, just and 
powerful New Year!! In these times of war, repression and RESISITANCE, we in 
the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign are calling on all our allies, supporters 
and friends to remember our brothers and sisters behind the walls!! Those 
amazing and inspiration compa�er@s that were incarcerated by the US 
government for their brave actions and commitment to the liberation of 
Puerto Rico; a colony of the United States for 108 years!

As the year 2007 begins, we are urging all of you to join ProLibertad's 
newest campaign:

ADOPT-A-PRISONER 2007

This is an easy project. There are only 5 easy steps to support this 
endeavor:

Step 1: Go to http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page4.html and read about one of 
our prisoners.

Step 2: Choose one of them or all of them and make the commitment to write 
to him/her/them once or twice a month.

Step 3: If you can, send them a commissary donation (small financial 
donation $5-whatever; every little bit counts)!! These small donations allow 
them to pay for phone calls to family/LEGAL COUNSEL/friends and also for 
over priced materials behind the walls. To learn more about how to donate go 
to: http://www.prolibertadweb.com/page5.html

Step 4: Email us Prolibertad@... and let us know who you've adopted.

The IDE includes a default style sheet for every project, and applies this style sheet to all pages in t We have been able to track in nearly-real-time every need from him, working in a team of 2 different people on this job.
More details in the next article! They appear without value.
Hibernate sits between your application and database, and seamlessly loads and saves objects, assisting you with persistence content management. Want to develop cool, fast and innovative Web applications?
5 includes the Visual Web Pack. Preparing the Hibernate Front End to the Database It is good practice to segregate the Hibernate code that accesses the database into a separate project. Using an Ajax-enabled component is like working with any other component:Drag and drop the component, set properties, and customize server-side event handlers. Use wrapper classes to connect the components to the Hibernate persistence classes. PermalinkLike this post? Creator, in my opinion, is the best tool for the JSF developers and designers, because it is built on top of the NetBeans platform. Click the Proxy Configuration button in the middle of the wizard panel and choose the Use HTTP Proxy radio button. I am able to deliver applications to my customers far more quickly and with a much higher level of quality.
My non-Java applications used ODBC.
Java EE 5 Tools Bundle:Develop and deploy your Ajax application. Download jasperreports-1.
The web application lets you view a trip report in either HTML format or PDF format.
Click New Library, type Hibernate in the Library Name field, and click OK.
From the BluePrints AJAX Components section of the Palette,
Add a fourth SessionBean property.
In part two I'll look at integrating databases for production use, such as Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL. Net to produce a superior product offering for software engineers.
The HibernateTravelPOJO. 1 download gives you an editor, debugger,compiler, and the underlying rich-client substrate. Note that the RatingData instances are constructed with hoverTexts, which display when the user hovers the mouse over the stars in the component.

Believing in yourself is another topic altogether. Dialogue works only if everybody is listening, and searching for the truth. Interactive search results: Yahoo! I was watching the TV coverage and I actually stopped watching it because they were actually giving more time to Diddy than they were to the people battling it out for the victory.
Object oriented and component oriented design techniques. It was a good conference for SiteMesh.
Matt Raible was arguing why Spring MVC rocks and WebWork sucks.
Access ErrorHeadline functionality has been disabled from your intranet. The only focus was on Lance. Those who only notice a race due to a celebrity are not likely to had a prior interest in the sport. Icici Bank did this through their Self Help Groups.

They will continue to focus on the race and runners.
Google foray into China. In its latest move, Sun has hired the developers responsible for JRuby: Charles Nutter and Thomas Enebo.
I continue to love Lucene.
I will talk about these books in the future, but they support Friedman's views. By making on-line banking available to villages, they remove the need for bank branches.
Rita, I think a lot of things played in. Backflippin' in 4 hours.
With a revamp of Yahoo! Sometimes, publicly stating goals can be a big motivator. Family and children can take up a lot of time. Matthew Porter was arguing why Spring MVC sucks and WebWork rocks. You will start off by learning what software you need to download and will then delve into the Java language basics. I will not be a happy camper for next 8 weeks.
QDox exposes information that isn't exposed by reflection, such as names of parameters or JavaDoc comments, which are useful for building tools to help visualize code. This work could be useful for people evaluating which frameworks to choose and possibly could be overlayed with a guide based on values.
Study this list and refer back to it when you become mired in Hibernate performance issues.
And a session is suppose to be 5-6 miles of quality miles. QDox has been immensely useful in my little developer toolbox, especially doing automated documentation generation.
Then, I went out for a warmup and I started to recognize guys.
Both things I can and will correct.

The unexpected arrival of the timber merchant and the sale of that piece of land hed never thought would bring him a cent -- was not that an evident sign that Providence was with him? He was too old and broken now to work his way about as he had planned at first, but here had come this six hundred dollars like rain from the sky. He would start as soon as he could sell his stock.

They were incarcerated for their political beliefs and actions  for Puerto 
Rico�s independence!!

The April Freedom Month is dedicated to educating, organizing and mobilizing

In the interview Liz claims that Howard worked with her at WWWW and one day told her she needed to clean up her act.
Maybe he could have a melt-down everywhere he goes.
6:15amHoward said everyone wants Artie to be weighed since he probably ate a lot of crap. 6:15amMore Sal Interviews From Harlem.
Howard said he agrees with that but it's attached to that sour-puss face of hers. Robin said she'd like to see Raquel Welch now. Artie said he used to beat off to Barbara Eden back when he was a kid. He said that he and his friend bet on a Lacrosse game one time and it was the most exciting 3 hours he had in his life. Howard said he's seen that chick but she doesn't do it for him at all.
His father is a big fan of the show and it's now changed for him as well. He went on to talk about how he got the invitation from Ruth Streeter to go to Ed Bradley's memorial service.
He said he told Bruce who he was and Bruce just said ''Alright man, yeah.
He told his kids about the time Gange sent that porn tape to the woman who was dying of cancer and how embarrassing that was. She said ti wasn't that she Howard told him to come out to the Hamptons with him and stop betting like that. 9:35amHoward's Kelly Ripa Story. He took a call from Bobo after that and also mentioned that he got a lot of feedback about the Penny Crone special that ran on Howard TV.

Howard assured him that he didn't.

Another caller said he knows what Artie goes through, he has to bet on games or he gets bored with them. Artie said that when he goes to a Yankee game people do come up to him and it's gotten to be more and more so it is kind of tough to go out and enjoy something like that.
He said that their standings are the same now. Howard had some audio of Michael Richards apologizing on Letterman's show last week.

Subject:Developers can use jMaki to enable the use of JavaScript in Java applications, either as a Java Server Pages tag library or a Java Server Faces component, the project's website noted.<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>
The request is processed by the ValidateServlet.
First of all, it frees developers from writing more common JavaScriptfunctions by providing pluggable  JavaScript libraries gearedtoward particular tasks, such as event-handling.
Another example of this collaboration could be a word processor that allows customers to provide customized filters for generating various file formats. In the meantime, solutions do exist.
In addition, developers can expose theJavaScript in these JavaServer Faces-developed AJAX-capable components toenable even more powerful interactions.
Maintaining Portlet StateWhen you dynamically update portlet content with an AJAX call to a servlet, how do you maintain the portlet's state?
The next couple of paragraphs will introduce the API. In the example above  id is the key which is the token passed by a client to  the XmlHttpProxyServlet along with some other parameters such as the location which is needed by the Yahoo Geocoder.
The XMLHttpRequest object makes a call.
1 and the second library is based on JSF 1.
The CometContext is the main object a component will use to interact with others Comet requests, implemented as CometHandler.
Accompanying this tip is an example JSF application that displays an animated version of the JSF life cycle. The external sources are typically other Web sites and their data may be obtained by the mashup developer in various ways, including, but not limited to APIs, XML feeds, and screenscraping. Once the appropriate values are populated in the HtmlForm  component, the default renderer is retrieved through the FacesContext object. Following is an example of the JSON based configuration file for  the XmlHttpProxyServlet .
As long as the app server or web container supports the proper version of JSF, then the components should run fine.
For example, you can use SVG to create sophisticated graphics and animations for an application. Hear where technology is headed in keynotes from industry leaders. Because the markup to be rendered for the FileUpload component would be the same as the UIForm with some default attributes set, coding the renderer from scratch would not make sense.
What has changed recently is the inclusion of support for the XMLHttpRequest object in the JavaScript runtimes of the mainstream browsers.
Java Studio Creator comes with some great AJAX-enabled JavaServer Faces components.
Although some scripting languages are compiled, most languages are interpreted.
Use the project home page?

2007) with a community march for the  Puerto Rican Political Prisoners in
the Bronx!!

On April 4th, 1980, several Puerto Rican Independentistas were arrested by
the U.S. government for fighting for Puerto Rican independence!!  For 108
years,  Puerto Rico has been a colony of the U.S. government!!
International law states, that a colony has the right to use whatever means
necessary to end colonialism!!

The Puerto Rican Political Prisoners are freedom fighters, not terrorists!!
They were incarcerated for their political beliefs and actions  for Puerto
Rico�s independence!!

The April Freedom Month is dedicated to educating, organizing and mobilizing
to free the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!

Political Prisoners are freed by the masses!!  It is time to bring this
issue back to the community; it is time to hit the streets!!

I took my laptop up north for the weekend, where we were visiting friends footsteps away from Interlochen. I haven't answered because I don't know what I don't know.
The campaign is big news for Quixtar, which previously didn't advertise, but is minuscule in comparison to companies that invest millions of dollars in ad budgets each year.
We make the bulk of our money on Q, not the tools. If the products being sold are competitively priced with competitor products, then the markup is irrelevant.
The same boss also yelled at a new staff member for "outdressing" her at an event. I met my husband at IU.
Day five was time to say goodbye. Zijn voorwaardelijke straf is omgezet in een onvoorwaardelijke straf. I know you and others may not like everything I post, just as I may not like some of the questions.
If my simple questions are perceived as "demands", that would be your problem.
But we would never encourage anyone to quit school to build their business, because what you learn in college will affect every aspect of your life and who would want to give that up?
Anyway, you mentioned you were busy with all the launches at Quixtar.
I think that will greatly help Artistry and NAO. I inherited it from my father-in-law, who generally had a disdain for my choice of vehicular transportation and in a way willed it to me upon his death last year.
I know this isn't the answer many of those watching this blog want.
The idea was that the Quixtar and Amway businesses would operate side-by-side, with Quixtar focusing on online sales while Amway would continue its person-to-person approach.
Exactly like other companies. In addition to Bruce and Bob, above, there is a former Diamond from Canada who stated the same thing.
Beth, we need to know if there is more coming, or if the above "corporate speak" is all we can expect from you.
Also, you must have missed my response to your question in the "Known Blogger" entry. The world is moving too fast for old fashioned, slow tactics to work, the game will be over before you put one foot on the playing field. Another highlights a "company tour" where you see a ladybug protecting tender plants from other insect predators and other ways Nutrilite's farms and facilities aren't like any competitor. I can only imagine this is some miscommunication.
Happy bosses day to all my bosses at Quixtar and Alticor! Zijn voorwaardelijke straf is omgezet in een onvoorwaardelijke straf.
Those and others are questions I can't answer because I don't have that information.
But the sun was warm and the lake welcoming.
But what we have in common is what sets us apart.
I don't know what the markup is on BSMs. Rich Devos had a little something to say about this in 1983 in his Directly Speaking recordings. The message was you needed to look good, but not too good!
In an industry that gains as many players as it loses every year we've been around since 1959 and have never missed a bonus payment. Here's a clue, however: I am the same "Curious" who was active on Bruce Anderson's blog, when it was available. to be honest, it's been a long time since I had this question and need to check the facts.

Join the ProLibertad Freedom Campaign as we KICK OFF �FREEDOM MONTH� (April
2007) with a community march for the  Puerto Rican Political Prisoners in
the Bronx!!

On April 4th, 1980, several Puerto Rican Independentistas were arrested by
the U.S. government for fighting for Puerto Rican independence!!  For 108
years,  Puerto Rico has been a colony of the U.S. government!!
International law states, that a colony has the right to use whatever means
necessary to end colonialism!!

The Puerto Rican Political Prisoners are freedom fighters, not terrorists!!
They were incarcerated for their political beliefs and actions  for Puerto
Rico�s independence!!

The April Freedom Month is dedicated to educating, organizing and mobilizing
to free the Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!

Political Prisoners are freed by the masses!!  It is time to bring this
issue back to the community; it is time to hit the streets!!

There will be translation into Spanish

The Puerto Rican political prisoners, Oscar Lpez Rivera, Carlos Alberto 
Torres, Haydee Beltrn Torres, and Jos Prez Gonzlez, are serving 
sentences from five years to life in prison for their uncompromising 
participation in and support for the fight to free Puerto Rico from U.S. 
colonial rule. Puerto Rico is a colony, its economy and government under the 
direct control of the U.S. The U.S. government has a long history of 
targeting supporters of Puerto Rican independence, including the use of the 
FBI and other political police on the island. This forum will be an 
opportunity to discuss why support for independence for Puerto Rico is in 
the interests of all working people in the U.S.

The Puerto Rican political prisoners, Oscar Lpez Rivera, Carlos Alberto 
Torres, Haydee Beltrn Torres, and Jos Prez Gonzlez, are serving 
sentences from five years to life in prison for their uncompromising 
participation in and support for the fight to free Puerto Rico from U.S. 
colonial rule. Puerto Rico is a colony, its economy and government under the 
direct control of the U.S. The U.S. government has a long history of 
targeting supporters of Puerto Rican independence, including the use of the 
FBI and other political police on the island. This forum will be an 
opportunity to discuss why support for independence for Puerto Rico is in 
the interests of all working people in the U.S.

SPEAKERS:
Benjamin Ramos, ProLibertad Freedom Campaign
Laura Garza, Socialist Workers Party
Bomexi Iztacchuatl, Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, NY

The Brooklyn Law School Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild 
Presents the cuban five and the U.S. role in terrorism against cuba

Wednesday, April 11 at 6 pm
Brooklyn Law School Subotnick Center
11th Floor 250, Joralemon Street

The Cuban Five are political prisoners in U.S. prison, unjustly 
convicted and sentenced to four life terms for peaceably opposing 
U.S.-sponsored terrorism and defending their country of Cuba. Their
ongoing legal struggle has major rami. cations in the constitutional 
right of defendants to an impartial jury trial. A 10-min. video will 
also be shown.

A reception with vegan food and wine will follow.

Speakers:

Gloria La Riva is director of the National Committee to Free the 
Cuban Five, and president of the Typographical Sector of the Northern 
California Media Workers Union Lo. 39521 (CWA). She was co-editor of 
the book on Fidel Castro's speeches, Cuba at the Crossroads (1997-
Ocean Press), and produced the documentary videos NATO Targets, 
Workers' Democracy in Cuba (1996), and the award-winning Genocide by 
Sanctions: The case of Iraq (1998).

Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, a constitutional rights attorney, is co-
founder of the Partnership for Civil Justice (PCJ), Co-Chair of the 
National Lawyers Guild Mass Defense Committee, and serves on the
Steering Committee of the ANSWER Coalition.

Heidi Boghosian is executive director of the National Lawyers Guild 
and co-host of the radio show "Law and Disorder."

The case of the Cuban Five is an organizational priority for the 
Guild and many of its attorneys who submitted amicus briefs on 
constitutional violations in their trial. She is traveling to Cuba in 
April to conduct research and in-person interiews about the Five.

JOSE PEREZ GONZALEZ FREEDOM FUND!!

The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign is calling for the formation of the Jose
Perez Gonzalez Freedom Fund!!

Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Jose Perez has contacted ProLibertad
be-cause he needs money for day to day living and to work on his beloved art
projects. Jose has been a model prisoner, teacher, leader and friend to many
of his brothers behind the walls. In order for him to communicate with
friends/family/legal counsel and to continue his art project he needs our
support!!

WE NEED YOUR GENEROSITY!! ProLibertad will collect the money for him and
send it to his commissary account in Des Moines, Iowa. Our goal is to raise
$500 by the end of Freedom Month for Jose Perez Gonzalez.  We are calling on
all individuals and organizations to make a donation!!

Please email us and let us know that you donated!! We are going to send Jose
Perez Gonzalez a letter with the list of the individuals and organizations
that donated to his fund; he wants to be able to thank everyone
individually!!

participate in the following calendar of events and actions for the
Cuban 5:


1. MONDAY APRIL 23RD NATIONAL CALL IN DAY FOR THE CUBAN 5!!

Since September 2006, The New York Times has ignored the People's

telephone call or email!!

WE WILL NOT BE IGNORED!! WE WILL BREAK THE MEDIA BLOCKADE!! WE MUST

&gt;Tito Kayak is in an Israeli Military Jail for his act of Solidarity
&gt;with the People of Palestine... Keep Posted... Palante, Fernando.
&gt;
&gt;      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
&gt;21 April 2007
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Rare case of 96 hour detention of international,
&gt;possible trial  on
&gt;Sunday
&gt;
&gt;Yesterday, after planting the Palestinian flag upon the  Israeli army
&gt;camera tower which watches over the village of Bil'in, and  remaining
&gt;up there for over five hours, Puerto Rican activist Tito Kayak  was
&gt;arrested by Israeli forces. The military commander is using  his
&gt;authority to keep Tito in jail for 96 hours, a practice which  is
&gt;regularly used on Palestinians. In the case of a Palestinian's  arrest,
&gt;after the 96 hours and before seeing a judge, the military  commander
&gt;many times will extend the holding time for another 96  hours.
&gt;
&gt;Tito's is a very rare case. In situations like this, with Israeli  or
&gt;international activists, arrestees are normally held for 24 hours  or
&gt;less. However, Tito is still currently in jail under the 96  hour
&gt;detention practice. Tito was scheduled to leave Palestine on  Sunday.
&gt;Tito may face trial at the Ofer military court on  Sunday.
&gt;
&gt;Tito's action was part of the weekly Friday demonstrations  against
&gt;Israel's Apartheid Wall in the village of Bil'in, which has stolen  60%
&gt;of the land from the village. Yesterday's demonstration came after  the
&gt;Second Annual Bil'in International Conference on  Non-violence.
&gt;Speakers included Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, Palestinian  Information
&gt;Minister, Vice president of the European Parliament Luisa  Morganitini,
&gt;and Noble Peace laureate Mairead Corrigan, who was shot in the  leg by
&gt;Israeli forces with a rubber-coated steel bullet at  Friday's
&gt;demonstration.

among those who battle oppression based on their gender expression
and/or sex and who they love. Individuals and organizations have
signed on from 45 countries, from every continent and from virtually
every state in the continental U.S. For more information, visit:

Speakers will include; Teresa Gutierrez, Joan Gibbs, Leslie Feinberg
and others!!

Leslie Cagan, Barbara Smith, Margo Okazawa-Rey, Imani Henry, LeiLani
Dowell,Stephen Funk, Alison Bechdel, Holly Hughes, QUIT!(Queers

I could not believe my eyes after about a week  of using the product because my flaccid length only grew a tremendous amount. I started slow since I did not know much about the exercises but once I retained some experience I began to  introduce myself to the more advanced ones and that is when my penis started growing. I can not thank Enlarge Patch Rx enough. So overall I started at about 6 inches in length and about 4 inches in girth, which is quite normal and now im 7 1/4 inches in length and 4 3/4 inches in girth. An entire inch in both length and  girth in a matter of a month! If you want to have gains and keep them forever you have to try Enlarge Patch Rx,  believe me you will not regret it!"Robbie V. Texas"I suppose my story won't be somewhat unusual to you. I'm a young man of 25 and I was completely frustrated about  my small penis. I was so shy to show it to any of the girl I had “relationship” with that I basically had no sexual life at all.  Enlarge Patch Rx patches did incredible thing to me. I was using them for 4 months and my penis is much more thicker and  about 2.5 inches longer now. All my doubts are gone. I really appreciate what you're guys doing. Thanx for saving my life!

Warning! Do not buy enhancement pills, they don't work!Over the past few years the market has become swamped with imitation male enhancement pills,  making it virtually impossible to know what is legitimate and what is fake! The logical step that millions of men are taking is to switch over to the more effective and  potent male enhancement Patches.Millions of men are already applying male enhancement patches daily and watching their size and drive go through the roof! Patches deliver the product into your system in a quicker and more  efficient manner than a pill ever could.

As of yet no other patch has matched ours for pure potency and effectiveness, the results you see from using Enlarge Patch are unreal!Here are just a few of the thousands of happy testimonials we receive every year;"Hi, I have been using Enlarge Patch Rxfor one month. I could not believe my eyes after about a week  of using the product because my flaccid length only grew a tremendous amount. I started slow since I did not know much about the exercises but once I retained some experience I began to  introduce myself to the more advanced ones and that is when my penis started growing. I can not thank Enlarge Patch Rx enough. So overall I started at about 6 inches in length and about 4 inches in girth, which is quite normal and now im 7 1/4 inches in length and 4 3/4 inches in girth. An entire inch in both length and  girth in a matter of a month! If you want to have gains and keep them forever you have to try Enlarge Patch Rx,  believe me you will not regret it!"Robbie V. Texas"I suppose my story won't be somewhat unusual to you. I'm a young man of 25 and I was completely frustrated about  my small penis. I was so shy to show it to any of the girl I had “relationship” with that I basically had no sexual life at all.  Enlarge Patch Rx patches did incredible thing to me. I was using them for 4 months and my penis is much more thicker and  about 2.5 inches longer now. All my doubts are gone. I really appreciate what you're guys doing. Thanx for saving my life!

Mexico�s public schools.

Ismael Guadalupe Ortiz

Vieques Land Struggle Activist

Report from Chiapas

Invited speakers on the Oaxaca struggle

<pre>CAON Releases Fact Sheet For Investors

Chan-On International Inc.
Symbol: CAON
Close: $0.72 UP 4.35%

Read this over the weekend, you won't be sorry. CAON has changed
direction and investors love it. Friday's volume went through the roof.
Big news expected Monday. Set your marker for CAON first thing Monday!

Howard asked Sal what his house is worth.

Richard came in and said that Sal was worried and talking about what he
was saying to his wife the day they drove by that house.
Robin kept picking on Howard and he kept pointing out that she wasn't
even there because of that tickle in her throat.
He said it threw the whole evening off for him because dinner was so
late.
She eventually hangs up on Richard but he calls her back and asks about
this wheelbarrow that she had already sold.

Sal laughed and said he's not thinking of selling at all.

He said the Sand Man was amazing and he loved everything in the movie.
Benjy found some information and it could be many things.

He heard that Sal is upset that the value of his house is going to go
down now. Howard thanked Tim for that and then went to break.

Artie said that they could probably get him into a hospital and get him
some help.

Sal came in and stripped down a little bit.

Lisa G said that Henry Hill is selling his artwork on eBay.

Jim The Psychic Mad Man Pulls A Card From Siobhan's Vagina.

He played the call where Richard calls a woman and asks her about some
stuff she's selling.

He's not sure how they do the special effects but they are just amazing.
Howard said he'd go to see that guy in concert if he put on a show.

Big Foot said he doesn't care about New Hampshire and doesn't want to
live there either.
Benjy found some information and it could be many things.
He said they raise the rent when he tells them that.

Gary told Howard that they had Big Foot's mother on the phone. He said
the Sand Man was amazing and he loved everything in the movie. She said
he's got his own family to take care of.

Howard mentioned that Big Foot Mark was going to be there today.
Howard thanked Tim for that and then went to break.

He said he had one shit that was green so he was wondering about that
since he hadn't eaten anything green.
Howard asked her what she would like to see for him. Another phone call
said that Howard doesn't care about what he does to other people and the
way he treats them.

He said he's been busy with the paperwork with the state.

He says that you should aim to make your exit as quiet as possible.

He said he's thought about how cool it would be to see a card pulled out
of a woman's private area. He said he sometimes just goes on the side of
the road and they're the size of logs. Sour Shoes continued to play as
Howard was talking about him. Sal came in and stripped down a little
bit. Big Foot said that he almost got mugged this morning when he came
in and gave some wacky explanation for that.

Artie asked Big Foot about the jacket he was wearing and asked if he
paid for it. She said he looked healthier and much better after losing
the weight.

Howard heard that Jon Hein didn't like the movie so he thought he was
out of his mind.
He did that for a few seconds and then broke back into song.
Howard asked her what she would like to see for him. Artie said he
thinks she's kind of hot.
He said if he had a TV show like Letterman does, he'd make Sour Shoes
his orchestra leader.

When he came in Howard asked him if he was smelly or something because
Will was making a motion that seemed to indicate he stunk.

Howard joked that he was shutting the door on him. He said he wouldn't
even leave early from that.

Big Foot didn't know where she lived and didn't know how to get there.
Howard asked her if she's been blowing guys like he heard she was.

Howard took one more fake call, this time it was Lily Tomlin audio clips
but Big Foot wasn't really playing along anymore by that point. He had
Siobhan sit on the stool they had in the studio. Big Foot said he's got
to put pressure on them somehow. The guy they called had no idea who was
calling him or why he was getting yelled at.

He said that he's got this girl who is a ''lesbian it is'' and she will
beat him up when he doesn't do things that she wants him to do.

Robin said she loves Al but he's always been a married man with children
to her.
Howard said he's stopped watching that show completely.
They also had Gary laughing and telling the guy he was joking around. It
was actually audio clips of Alec Baldwin's voice mail to his daughter
that someone was playing.

He said there could be some people who are tired of Spider-Man but he's
sure not.

Howard joked that he was shutting the door on him. He then starts saying
stuff that has nothing to do with their conversation and then asks about
the stuff the woman has already sold. Howard asked him if he likes black
people and he didn't get shocked.

On the ride horsemen galloped to and fro, but all the street seemed

desired final mode. But, at a bottom line, they are scofflaws.
But the love of peace which these countries affect is simply the 
product of their weakness. The Man In Black sheathes his sword

<pre>SREA Acquires $75 Million Dollar Asset!

Score One Inc.(SREA)
$0.30

News hit just after close. SREA has acquired the $75 Million peace of
land for the new "Recreation Town" in Dalian. This new project mimics a
Facility in "Shui On" that profited more than $100 Million USD. SREA is
going to go through the roof after this hits investors this weekend. Get

Accordingly, executives can configure their dashboards to monitor
performance and create personalized mashups with just a few clicks.

Yahoo Maps JavaScript Ajax API Recall that, for this sample portlet, you
use the Yahoo Maps JavaScript Ajax API to create a mashup.

I did not include the render option because I want all components to be
re-rendered as a result of this action, which is the default behavior.
You can use any number of JavaServer Faces component functionalities and
wrap them in a parent component for other developers to use. You also
create a portlet preference, mashupUrls, which is a collection to hold
the personalized GeoRSS feed URLs for each of the users.
jsp file in the download bundle. Another limitation of this  technique
is that HttpSession tracking will need to be enabled and the session
must be still alive for this technique to work. Conclusion Bringing
together data from different sources and visually representing it on a
draggable and zoomable map, as in mashup portlets, renders a rich,
robust user experience. Subsequently, the portal can personalize that
data so that its users can have their own mashups with data sources that
suit their individual needs, hence saving a major task in the
development cycle.

Otherwise, you see, he said, I would lose my curly head. Our 
Antarctic doubles that were modelled with great exactitude would have 
reasoned in the very same way, for they did not know that they were 
simply copies of human beings.
Our old friend caustic. Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.
Our guys filed slowly back behind the Mausoleum. Otis, who, as Miss 
Lucretia R.
Our friendly support staff will be happy to assist you. Ou encore sur qui.
Our business went only moderately well. Our best to you and much love 
from all at Camp Alder-sgate and especially the Thomas Family.
Otis had an interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost 
had given to Virginia. Our initial hardware technology consists of 
several kinds of input devices.
Our Yura was quite a different case. Our forebear took a bite - blame 
his wife or blame the snake - tasting the forbidden fruit.
Oui, avec cette definition il y a effectivement unicite. Otmoem lubie

Our file is not fragmented, so we have the only one data run. Otis, 
the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase, every one told him 
he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no doubt at all that 
the place was haunted.
Our Shiva system requires about 10 seconds to initialize before 
starting PPP. Oui, comm'encez, monsieur Gorskit.
Oui, cette Russie, que j'aimais toujours. Our master would 
disapprove, as I am surely needed here more than you, and you fear 
him more than you fear being made damane.
Our conscious decisions, I should say. Ouch, the hot topic.

Our ecosystem might well include communication between different

Ottavio forces himself to think. Our chronometers said so many miles.
Our Lady help my lord. Ou bien tu te saouleras.
Our products and technologies are used to maximize performance of 
systems ranging from embedded microprocessors to high-end 
supercomputers. Our engineering, mass-storage, and power-pinching 
expertise combined with a superb technical support reputation ensure 
that you'll meet your time-to-market or time-to-data goals.
Our conversation was like that too-all roundabout, hedged, with the 
most familiar places, known to us from childhood and school years, 
fenced off. Our nations have many interests in common.
Otherwise, you won't be able to access any created shares. Our name 
was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.
Our blue shadows are enormous. Our coverage by the various 
associations is really at an unacceptably poor level.
Otherwise, you may confuse CSE. Our last bit of business, as far as 
expressions goes, is to modify procedure Factor to allow for 
parenthetical expressions.
Our Person's capacity to condone all this, to find reasonable 
explanations and so forth, endears him to us, but also provokes 
limpid mirth, alas, at times. Our Hosaka contacts were like 
specialized cells protecting the parent organism.
Our Tarquin thus Did softly press the rushes ere he waken'd The

Oughtn't to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Our

be done and would not have blinded themselves with self-praise.

It sounds like a soap opera, but this story is imbued with more
humanity, understanding, and well-rounded characters. Do not trust a

grasp of how those rankings or values were generated, and have a trust
that the methods employed are valid.

But the fact is there are many people out there offering fantasy

Lugo has been so putrid that he is finally starting to lose playing time
to Alex Cora, a player known for his glove and not his stick.

So I thought I would spend a little time suggesting some traits one
should look for in a fantasy baseball information provider, be it an
individual or Web site. com, FantasyBaseball. Read the book review of
Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides.

That said, fantasy owners currently stocking Weathers, or just those in
need of saves, may want to go out and grab Guardado off waivers before
the grumblings of a closer switch get louder. Offensively, he always was
capable of hitting in the big leagues and the Brewers inserted him into

First and foremost, avoid anonymous information.

Assuming the information providers do share their philosophies and
methods with their users, it is incumbent to, at minimum, agree with
their way of thinking. If he still has trade value now would likely be a
very good time to move him.

It's one of those self-help, you-can-be-the-best-in-the-world type of

EntreMetrix Inc. (ERMX)

Big news last week pushed investors to the table. Wallst.net release of
an audio interview got them excited. This is only the first day after
the release. Act fast and get on ERMX Tuesday morning!

I applied curing tape over the crescent crack and finished by removing
my towel cover and pressure cured, filled the pit and polished.

I had difficulty getting resin into that last inch so resorted to drill
the end of the crack, popping a small bullseye and filling from there.
You sound like a little kid who just learned how to swear.

This will be something they can see. Cure the energy crisis? No job is
so simple that it cannot be done wrong.
Review that and tell me I am a horrible person. The Bible says Thou
shalt not kill, PERIOD no thou shalt not kill but in war it is okay, if
you commit a crime well you can kill then, there are no exceptions to
that. I appreciate any feedback you may have on the previously described
repairs, as it is my goal to be expert at this work.

A one-night stand with no love, a Quaalude and three beers can also bear
children.
I made my points, and you came back with finger pointing.

Try any Christian who believes in the bible.
Finally, I find your quote from Jefferson apropo.
there is scars and thats the nature of wr.

But the real dangerous groups were strengthened by our attack on Iraq.

This was a bunch at Texas Instruments. why do the Ten Commandments say
nothing about homosexuality but says a slew of things against the things
heterosexuals do on the daily?

Is there something else I can do to fix it better now?

Some pretty nice country huh, hope you got as much out of the training
as I did.

In fact, he was perfectly boxed in, hand cuffed, if you will.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Hello, Werner

You know, I've been rereading our letters and I've noticed that all I write you sounds like some usual standard and
it seems to me that my letters are boring. I was so impressed with this
discovery that I decided to write you a letter and to show you that I am much more many-sided and to prove that you
can find me more interesting and deep then other ladies here in this agency. 
What is love? Closeness, first of all not only in souls, but a physical also. Of course sexual habits are different
for every one, but here we can't speak about them as we only write letters, but I mention that because maybe one day
we will meet and then you will have to know what I think and how I imagine this being with a man I like, love.
Some men have several women: one for good conversation, one for parties and
clubs, one for sex, one of them he visits for dinners (because she cooks so well)))) oh yes, and the last one he gets
married with and some people say that the more parts of life of your man you know then more he loves you. So, I want
to be that one he gets married with, the one who cooks, who goes out with him, the one he makes love with and the one
who will talk to him when he wants this.
I think such things as knowing his friends, family, being in his home equivalent to several "I love you".
You can find me at http://worldmeetlove.com/findyou


Looking forward to get a note from you

Gylian D.

"Ours may be one of the most ridiculous accusations of espionage in 
the history of this country" 

-Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo, The Cuban 5

This September 12th, 2007 will mark the 9 th year anniversary of the 
arrest of the Cuban 5; five US held Cuban political prisoners 
incarcerated for protecting Cuba from U.S. sponsored terrorist 
actions.
 
Last year, President Ricardo Alarcon, of the Cuban Parliament, 
declared Sept. 12 th through October 6th to be a period of time to 
raise awareness on the case of the Cuban 5.  The Popular Education 
Project to Free the Cuban 5 took this proclamation as a call to 
action.   By publishing this call through various list serves and 
community mediums, we were able to motivate organizations, 
individuals, teachers, clergy and students to organize a series of 
events throughout the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean.

The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 is committed to 
building an international movement for the Cuban 5 by making Sept. 12 
th-October 9th "Free the Cuban 5 Month."  We have extended the period 
of time in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Ernest "Che" 
Guevara's assassination by the Bolivian army, under the direction of 
the CIA. 
 
We are asking organizations in New York City to endorse "Free the 
Cuban 5 Month" and to organize an event dedicated to the Cuban 5 
within your community or for your constituency.   Our goal is to 
organize a calendar of events throughout New York City and 
internationally that can be circulated through colleges, communities, 
unions, and churches.   Our goal is to educate, organize and mobilize 
as many people as possible to support the work to free the Cuban 5.
 
In order to endorse, email the Project at: 
freethecubanfive@hotmail.com and let us know which date within the 
month you will organize your event.  
 
The Project will be organizing a special "Free the Cuban 5 Month" 
Kickoff event on Wednesday September 12 th, 2007 at 7pm tentatively 
scheduled at St. Mary's Church in Harlem.  It will be a 
forum/reception with a small panel of invited speakers and a 
delicious Latino dinner.   All proceeds from the reception/forum will 
go the Cuban 5's commissary funds.
 
Join us in building the worldwide movement to free the Cuban 5.  Cuba 
is calling for our support and solidarity; we cannot stand by and let 
this period of time go by without action, education and fund-
raising.  
 
Email us with your endorsement and your activity as soon as you 
possible. 
 

FREE THE CUBAN 5!!
Benjamin Ramos, 
Frank Velgara,

Subject:The sample does not test client-side performance.<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Brokers Move On ERMX!

EntreMetrix Inc. (ERMX)
$0.19

Heavy trading today as ERMX announced its launch of digital support
tools for its portfolio companies. Brokers are getting ahead of this
steady climb as they grab up large blocks of shares for there clients.
Look at the numbers and get on ERMX Friday morning!

The listener gets the selected value from the JList and then looks up
the stream in the applet context.
A package that contains the code for the sample application accompanies
the tip. The WSDL file is an XML file that describes a web service, its
location, and  the operations that the service exposes. It can help
identify bugs before deployment. Indexed properties are distinguished
from regular properties in that they have multiple values, where each
value is accessed by an index.
This means that new windows can be created from the modal dialog and
will accept input. You can download the sample archive for the Pitfalls
in Constructing Java Persistence Query Language Queries tip.

One of these was support for IndexedPropertyChangeEvent.

In this case, only a user in the  role "arole" will cause the servlet to
retrieve the "message" String and set it as an HttpServletRequest
attribute. Consider it a way to do cleanup tasks within an object.
Because the WeakTest program is lightweight and doesn't use much memory
an explicit call to the garbage collector is necessary.

See the sample  application package for the actual code. You can
download the sample archive for the Using Java  Persistence With
JavaServer Faces Technology tip.

You can find the binding level policy for the sample in the WSDL file.
No longer are you limited in scope to one level of modality: on or off.
This tip examines a sample application that uses the Java  Persistence
API with the JSF framework.

It hides the implementation details of the subclasses, allowing the
factory to directly call the constructors for the interface
implementations. By default, listener references are strong references
and are not garbage collected when your method returns. Identifying the
need for the Singleton pattern at design time can simplify development.
In fact, the bicubic setting was always ignored, and instead, bilinear
interpolation was used. The first way involves the Observer and
Observable classes found in the java. A benchmark is a test or tests
that assesses the performance of a product. The Facade  could be a web
component such as a servlet or a session bean.

By default, listener references are strong references and are not
garbage collected when your method returns. For instance, where do all
those new pixels in the scaled up image come from?
If you don't use generics, you won't find  those bugs until the
application runs. Entities Used in This Tip  Let's start with two
persistent entities. If you are unfamiliar with the two interpolation
options, it helps to understand what happens when scaling up an image.

It describes how subclasses of a particular object, or more typically,
implementers of a particular interface, do the actual object creation.

No longer are you limited in scope to one level of modality: on or off.
A later tip showed how to create  custom components with JavaServer
Faces technology. This tip focuses on WSIT's support for web services
security.

After streams are stored, you can retrieve them either by getting a
single stream or by getting all streams. It enhances overall security
through key derivations and improves performance by avoiding repeated
key exchanges in multi-message exchange scenarios. There is nothing
technically wrong with the classes and they are still present in the
libraries. A property that generates a PropertyChangeEvent when its
value changes is called a bound property.
You can implement this approach in many different ways.
In this case,  there is a trust relationship between the client and the 
service. The entities are Customer and Order, and they have a
one-to-many relationship. The tip assumes that you  understand the basic
terms and concepts of the Java Persistence API.

Also see the JavaBeans Trail in the Java Tutorial.

As mentioned previously, the query  in this example returns a list of
these Item objects, each of which represents a row in the database.
That's not quite all there is to creating a Singleton.

VPSN THE RISING STAR, IS SET FOR SUPERNOVA STATUS ON MONDAY!

Geneon Entertainment is joining the digital age by signing a content
agreement with Azureus. Wonder how Bush would spin that.
Are we to assume that this is going to be
picking-up-trash-along-the-highway type community service? I sometimes
feel bad that I feel some added measure of impunity to what I say
because I'm white and, well, not Muslim.

They don't think Scooter should go to jail, because he's one of them, so
they assume we all feel the same way. So, here's your task for today -
you tell me: Is Americanized Manga Still Manga?

You could start with this: James Madison said that a president pardoning
someone to protect himself would be an impeachable offense. But while
you may not see Goku or Sakura at one of these events, the festivals
themselves are quite real. We can FORCE-GROW the clone!

I'm kind of suspicious of the anti-gay movement, and put few things past
them when it comes to slimy moves. I'm kind of suspicious of the
anti-gay movement, and put few things past them when it comes to slimy
moves. Our new manga guide, Deb Aoki has posted a great article on
Americanized manga.

but how effed up would it have been, if it had passed the legislators
and the voters. Please contact your system administrator to report this
fault.
Check out MiKael's Mania blog to read more about Trouble and Surprise.
That's the premise behind MAR, one of the latest anime releases from VIZ
Media.
Olbermann's wonderful rant seems to be largely on the subject of Bush
deciding that he is the law, and that he knows better than our legal
system, but other presidents do the same thing.

And I think Gore could be pretty solid in other realms, too. 's part;
maybe they have information we don't. Well, reading and commenting. Read
about Megan and Belle's story on their gallery page!

Well, Trouble and Surprise have just celebrated their first birthday.

True, the road is our only passage from Thorbardin to Newsea, but we

Subject:i very want to find my love<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Good day, my friend

This letter is of great importance. I am here in order to build my own 
Planet which will be called a Planet of Love. My future family will live 
there.
Maybe it sounds stupid, but I am serious at present time. I have serious and 
firm intentions to find a good man and to create family with him.
I am tired of empty searches and short romantic dates. I need stable life, I 
need to love and to be beloved.
I dream about the day  when I will give my heart and devote my life to a 
good man.
I will call him "my Darling Husband" and I will be his "Sweet beloved Wife". 
Oh, so sweet words, I dream to hear them!
I see that you look for your second half, too. I ask you to stop your search 
at me. We are both single people, but we have everything for love: kind 
hearts, tenderness, hopes and dreams.
My heart will beat faster while I am (find me http://lonelyheartwaiting.com/hotlove  )
waiting for your letter.

Bye

Gilian D

- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

Van will be leaving from in front of 1199 SEIU (43rd Street between 8th
and 9th Aves.) at 10 a.m. sharp! Only $20 roundtrip (including Philly car
caravan!). Call 718-601-4751 or email: frankvelgara@... or

NO EXCUSES!
NOW IS THE TIME TO PAROLE THE MOVE 9!

Saturday, August 11, 2007

45th &amp; Kingsessing Ave. at Noon

The MOVE 9 complete their minimum sentence of 30 years in Aug. of 2008 and
become eligible for parole. They will be interviewed by the parole board
in a few months. We intend to do everything possible to insure that they
are in fact paroled, so this Aug. 11th we are doing a car caravan through
Philadelphia neighborhoods.

We want to inform people of the current status of The MOVE 9 and gather
support to pressure the parole board to release innocent MOVE people. We
want as many cars and people as possible. If you want to participate but
don't have a car, contact us at 215-387-4107 and we will try to get you
into one of the participating cars.

We will assemble at 45th &amp; Kingsessing Ave. at 12:00 pm. Join us for a day
in the community and working for the release of The MOVE 9. This year's
activity is more important than ever because of the upcoming parole
hearings.

This is not simply a commemoration of the Aug. 8, 1978 police attack on
MOVE, but it is the launching of our campaign for the parole of innocent
MOVE people.  Join us in the fight for freedom!

Join NYC Jericho, ProLibertad, Latin@s por Mumia and Friends and take our
Freedom Van to Philly on August 11th to demand parole for the MOVE 9.

Van will be leaving from in front of 1199 SEIU (43rd Street between 8th
and 9th Aves.) at 10 a.m. sharp! Only $20 roundtrip (including Philly car
caravan!). Call 718-601-4751 or email: frankvelgara@... or
mateare@... to reserve your tickets now!

NO EXCUSES!
NOW IS THE TIME TO PAROLE THE MOVE 9!

Saturday, August 11, 2007

45th &amp; Kingsessing Ave. at Noon

The MOVE 9 complete their minimum sentence of 30 years in Aug. of 2008 and
become eligible for parole. They will be interviewed by the parole board
in a few months. We intend to do everything possible to insure that they
are in fact paroled, so this Aug. 11th we are doing a car caravan through
Philadelphia neighborhoods.

We want to inform people of the current status of The MOVE 9 and gather
support to pressure the parole board to release innocent MOVE people. We
want as many cars and people as possible. If you want to participate but
don't have a car, contact us at 215-387-4107 and we will try to get you
into one of the participating cars.

We will assemble at 45th &amp; Kingsessing Ave. at 12:00 pm. Join us for a day
in the community and working for the release of The MOVE 9. This year's
activity is more important than ever because of the upcoming parole
hearings.

This is not simply a commemoration of the Aug. 8, 1978 police attack on
MOVE, but it is the launching of our campaign for the parole of innocent
MOVE people.  Join us in the fight for freedom!

Do you buy pharmaceuticals online? The US NMA was specifically established to protect the consumer. Our experts check every online shop for bogus medicines. The blacklist of unreliable or simply fraud shops is updated every week. We strongly recommend to visit our site before buying any medical products online. visit us

Our site http://www.us-nma.com/

The common ways of online cheating are:
- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

Please check our blacklist of unreliable and fraud shops before buying any medical products online!!! Protect your family and yourself. mismartilendmarks X1BDUVpBXlZHVlBfQ1VcVlxzUVJDXUZERh9RXFk=

A CALL TO ARTISTS! Calling all Boricua/Non-Boricua Artists for a Fund 
Raising CD to aid our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!

The Welfare Poets and The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign have come together to 
collaborate on a fund-raising project to directly aid the current Puerto 
Rican Political Prisoners; incarcerated for fighting for the independence 
and self-determination of Puerto Rico. Additionally, we would also want to 
assist past political prisoners who have been freed and are now attempting 
to survive in a system where many channels are closed to them. It is also 
our intention to create a general legal fund to assist present and even 
possibly future political prisoners.

We are directing this posting to local bands and world renown Puerto Rican 
artists who have the eye of the music world. Depending on how many artists 
come forward and who actually submit songs, there is a po-tential for us to 
get funds so distribution can be created on a larger scale.


Regarding Song Submissions:
�We have begun accepting submissions.
�All submissions and questions about submissions can be sent to: 
FreedomAlbum@...
�We want all artist of all genres to be apart of this potentially monumental 
album for Freedom -- Bomba, Plena, Hip Hop, Reggaeton, Salsa, Jibaro, 
Regggae, Punk, Rock or any other form of music
�Songs do not need to be directly about the political prisoners and the 
struggle for Puerto Rico's Indpendence, although we definitely won't 
discourage you to do so. For the most part, they should be uplifting and 
somehow connected to our people, island, culture and history.


Goal:
�We hope this album serves to raise the necessary funds as outlined above, 
but also to unify the Puerto Rican community on many levels. Unifying Puerto 
Rican artists from NYC, Chicago, California, Philadelphia, New Jersey and 
all over the Puerto Rican Diaspora, with each other and other artists from 
the island � all coming together under the banner of supporting those who 
have sacrificed everything for the

�We also hope to unify organizations in an attempt to move forward on better 
grounds on behalf of the companeros.

�Not only will we be spreading the word about the Puerto Rican Political 
Prisoners' existence and indi-vidual cases to a wide range of individuals 
open their eyes for the first time or updating those who are already in the 
know, but we will also be offering the people a way to assist, all people 
who support the struggle for our companeros release, Puerto Rican and 
beyond.


To Organizations:
�We call on other organizations to help put this album together. There is so 
much to be done and time is most precious. Collectively, our efforts can 
reach the necessary millions to make a significant impact. These are our 
prisoners, they remain in jail and isolated due to our collective inaction 
and we can rem-edy this. To endorse thie effort, please email us at

The fight for Puerto Rico's Independence go as far back as indigenous 
resistance to Spanish occupation. For well over 600 years, countless and 
nameless individuals have fought for our islands sovereignty. Some have paid 
the ultimate price with their lives.

Others have been held captive, arrested against their will, by a court which 
held no jurisdiction over their cases and tramples on their international 
right to fight for the lib-eration of their homeland, our homeland, Puerto 
Rico. The Puerto Rican people have been able to free many of our political 
prisoners. We did so because we created unity amongst ourselves and because 
we welcomed the solidarity of all our allies. This Freedom Al-bum is another 
example of our creativity in building solidarity and unity amongst 
ourselves.

This album will educate, agitate and help further build our movement to free 
our compa�er@s behind the walls.

Our Political Prisoners are:

Oscar Lopez Rivera was born in San Sebastian, Puerto Rico on January 6, 
1943. At the age of 12, he moved to Chi-cago with his family. He was a 
well-respected community activist and a prominent independence leader for 
many years prior to his arrest. Oscar was one of the founders of the Rafael 
Cancel Miranda High School, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High 
School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was a 
com-munity organizer for the Northwest Community Organization (NCO), ASSPA, 
ASPIRA and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found 
FREE, (a half-way house for convicted drug addicts) and ALAS (an 
educa-tional program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois).

He was active in various community struggles, mainly in the area of health 
care, employment and police brutality. He also participated in the 
development of the Committee to Free the Five Puerto Rican Nationalists. In 
1975, he was forced underground, along with other comrades. He was captured 
on May 29, 1981, after 5 years of being persecuted by the FBI as one of the 
most feared fugitives from US "justice". Oscar, who has a daughter named 
Clarissa, is currently serving a 55-year sentence for seditious conspiracy 
and other charges. He was convicted of conspiracy to escape along with Jaime 
Delgado, (a veteran independence leader), Dora Garcia, (a prominent 
community activist) and Kojo Bomani-Sababu, a New Afrikan political 
prisoner.

Oscar was one of 13 Puerto Rican political prisoners offered some form of 
leniency by the Clinton Administration in the fall of 1999. According to the 
Chicago Sun Times, he "declined the president's offer, which still would 
have him left with 10 years to serve on conspiracy to escape charges. Now he 
faces at least 20 more years in prison. His sister, Zenaida Lopez, said he 
turned the offer down because he would be on parole. 'Accepting what they 
are offering him is like prison outside of prison,' she said. Zenaida Lopez 
said her brother 'was in total agreement' with the decision of the 11 others 
to take the conditional clemency." Oscar is presently in prison in Terre 
Haute, Indiana and his release date is 7/27/2027.


Carlos Alberto Torres was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on September 19, 1952. 
His parents moved to New York, finally settling in Chicago. He studied in 
the University of Illinois in Carbondale and Chicago. He studied sociology 
at Southern Illinois University and the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
Carlos Alberto was involved in the struggles to recruit more Latin@s to the 
University, against racism, and police abuse. Carlos was one of the founders 
of the Rafael Cancel Miranda Puerto Rican High School now known as the Dr. 
Pedro Albizu Campos Puerto Rican High School and participated in the 
Committee to Free the 5 Nationalists. In 1976, Carlos was forced to go 
underground and was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He was captured along 
with other comrades and sentenced to 78 years on charges of seditious 
conspiracy, among other charges.

Although the Clinton Administration offered clemency to 12 Puerto Rican 
political prisoners in the fall of 1999, no leniency was granted to Carlos 
Torres, whom prosecutors described as a leader of the Fuerzas Armadas de 
Liberaci�n Nacional (FALN), an underground organization which fought for 
Puerto Rico's independence in the 1970s and '80s. His release date is 2024. 
He is currently in prison in Oxford, Wisconsin.


Haydee Beltran Torres was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico on June 7, 1955. When 
Haydee was 12 years old, her parents moved to Chicago. At Tuley High School, 
she organized a boycott that demanded the firing of a racist principal. 
Haydee attended the University of Illinois where she was an outspoken 
defender of Latino students� rights. Haydee was forced underground in 1976 
and was captured April 4, 1980. She has been sentenced to life in prison on 
charges including seditious conspiracy. Haydee was the first POW to receive 
a life sentence. She was kept in total isolation from the other prisoners of 
war and was transferred to a special control unit which limited visits. It 
was a year before she was allowed to see her family.

At the MCC in Chicago, she was classified as �no visitors allowed�. Haydee 
was subject to physical abuse in interrogations for refusing to implicate 
her comrades in unfounded crimes. This was done several times by FBI and 
other government agents. These and other inhumane acts by the U.S. 
government have led to serious injuries which prison medical directors have 
misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received injections of unknown medications.


Jose Perez Gonzalez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on January 14th, 1968; he 
is the son of a butcher and his mother is retired government worker. He is 
married with three children. He is a member of Mayaguezano por La Salud y el 
Ambiente. He is well known in his neighborhood, of Barrio Segundo in Ponce. 
He is a family man with three children. He was a civil disobedient and 
served three months in jail for his support activities. Jose was the only 
member of the Vieques 12 who went to trial. He was found guilty and was 
sentenced to five years in jail. His release is 1/17/2008.

Message:<br><br>
<pre>Good day

We've got only one life to live and I want to live it as good as I can.
I've found you and now I can't imagine how I lived without you for my entire 
life?!
I want to get used to you, I want to learn you, I want to accept you as you 
are.
I try to imagine you and in my own imagination I am already getting used to 
you:  I am used to your eyes, soft and wise, to your hands, to your gentle 
touch:
I haven't seen you in real life, but inside, in my soul, I already feel how 
warm and happy your heart can be just from love.  I realize that there can 
be another sitting by your side, touching your hair, watching you, hugging 
you:  However I know that, you can't imagine my confidence, but I know that 
we can match.
I don't think that our silence will help us, so I am here, at 
[http://firstloveall.com/finders, and I hope that you will touch my heart with your 
letter soon, my dear.

Looking forward to hear from you

Nataliya V

A CALL TO ARTISTS! Calling all Boricua Artists for a Fund
Raising CD to aid our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!

The Welfare Poets and The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign have come together to
collaborate on a fund-raising project to directly aid the current Puerto
Rican Political Prisoners; incarcerated for fighting for the independence
and self-determination of Puerto Rico. Additionally, we would also want to
assist past political prisoners who have been freed and are now attempting
to survive in a system where many channels are closed to them. It is also
our intention to create a general legal fund to assist present and even
possibly future political prisoners.

We are directing this posting to local bands and world renown Puerto Rican
artists who have the eye of the music world. Depending on how many artists
come forward and who actually submit songs, there is a po-tential for us to
get funds so distribution can be created on a larger scale.


Regarding Song Submissions:
�We have begun accepting submissions.
�All submissions and questions about submissions can be sent to:
FreedomAlbum@...
�We want all artist of all genres to be apart of this potentially monumental
album for Freedom -- Bomba, Plena, Hip Hop, Reggaeton, Salsa, Jibaro,
Regggae, Punk, Rock or any other form of music
�Songs do not need to be directly about the political prisoners and the
struggle for Puerto Rico's Indpendence, although we definitely won't
discourage you to do so. For the most part, they should be uplifting and
somehow connected to our people, island, culture and history.


Goal:
�We hope this album serves to raise the necessary funds as outlined above,
but also to unify the Puerto Rican community on many levels. Unifying Puerto
Rican artists from NYC, Chicago, California, Philadelphia, New Jersey and
all over the Puerto Rican Diaspora, with each other and other artists from
the island � all coming together under the banner of supporting those who
have sacrificed everything for the liberation of Puerto Rico.

�We also hope to unify organizations in an attempt to move forward on better
grounds on behalf of the companeros.

�Not only will we be spreading the word about the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners' existence and indi-vidual cases to a wide range of individuals
open their eyes for the first time or updating those who are already in the
know, but we will also be offering the people a way to assist, all people
who support the struggle for our companeros release, Puerto Rican and
beyond.


To Organizations:
�We call on other organizations to help put this album together. There is so
much to be done and time is most precious. Collectively, our efforts can
reach the necessary millions to make a significant impact. These are our
prisoners, they remain in jail and isolated due to our collective inaction
and we can rem-edy this. To endorse thie effort, please email us at
freedomalbum@...

regarding the project and planning meetings



The fight for Puerto Rico's Independence go as far back as indigenous
resistance to Spanish occupation. For well over 500 years, countless and
nameless individuals have fought for our islands sovereignty. Some have paid
the ultimate price with their lives.

Others have been held captive, arrested against their will, by a court which
held no jurisdiction over their cases and tramples on their international
right to fight for the lib-eration of their homeland, our homeland, Puerto
Rico. The Puerto Rican people have been able to free many of our political
prisoners. We did so because we created unity amongst ourselves and because
we welcomed the solidarity of all our allies. This Freedom Al-bum is another
example of our creativity in building solidarity and unity amongst
ourselves.

This album will educate, agitate and help further build our movement to free
our compa�er@s behind the walls.
_______________________________________________________________________________

Our Political Prisoners are:

Oscar Lopez Rivera was born in San Sebastian, Puerto Rico on January 6,
1943. At the age of 12, he moved to Chi-cago with his family. He was a
well-respected community activist and a prominent independence leader for
many years prior to his arrest. Oscar was one of the founders of the Rafael
Cancel Miranda High School, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High
School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was a
com-munity organizer for the Northwest Community Organization (NCO), ASSPA,
ASPIRA and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found
FREE, (a half-way house for convicted drug addicts) and ALAS (an
educa-tional program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois).

He was active in various community struggles, mainly in the area of health
care, employment and police brutality. He also participated in the
development of the Committee to Free the Five Puerto Rican Nationalists. In
1975, he was forced underground, along with other comrades. He was captured
on May 29, 1981, after 5 years of being persecuted by the FBI as one of the
most feared fugitives from US "justice". Oscar, who has a daughter named
Clarissa, is currently serving a 55-year sentence for seditious conspiracy
and other charges. He was convicted of conspiracy to escape along with Jaime
Delgado, (a veteran independence leader), Dora Garcia, (a prominent
community activist) and Kojo Bomani-Sababu, a New Afrikan political
prisoner.

Oscar was one of 13 Puerto Rican political prisoners offered some form of
leniency by the Clinton Administration in the fall of 1999. According to the
Chicago Sun Times, he "declined the president's offer, which still would
have him left with 10 years to serve on conspiracy to escape charges. Now he
faces at least 20 more years in prison. His sister, Zenaida Lopez, said he
turned the offer down because he would be on parole. 'Accepting what they
are offering him is like prison outside of prison,' she said. Zenaida Lopez
said her brother 'was in total agreement' with the decision of the 11 others
to take the conditional clemency." Oscar is presently in prison in Terre
Haute, Indiana and his release date is 7/27/2027.


Carlos Alberto Torres was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on September 19, 1952.
His parents moved to New York, finally settling in Chicago. He studied in
the University of Illinois in Carbondale and Chicago. He studied sociology
at Southern Illinois University and the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Carlos Alberto was involved in the struggles to recruit more Latin@s to the
University, against racism, and police abuse. Carlos was one of the founders
of the Rafael Cancel Miranda Puerto Rican High School now known as the Dr.
Pedro Albizu Campos Puerto Rican High School and participated in the
Committee to Free the 5 Nationalists. In 1976, Carlos was forced to go
underground and was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He was captured along
with other comrades and sentenced to 78 years on charges of seditious
conspiracy, among other charges.

Although the Clinton Administration offered clemency to 12 Puerto Rican
political prisoners in the fall of 1999, no leniency was granted to Carlos
Torres, whom prosecutors described as a leader of the Fuerzas Armadas de
Liberaci�n Nacional (FALN), an underground organization which fought for
Puerto Rico's independence in the 1970s and '80s. His release date is 2024.
He is currently in prison in Oxford, Wisconsin.


Haydee Beltran Torres was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico on June 7, 1955. When
Haydee was 12 years old, her parents moved to Chicago. At Tuley High School,
she organized a boycott that demanded the firing of a racist principal.
Haydee attended the University of Illinois where she was an outspoken
defender of Latino students� rights. Haydee was forced underground in 1976
and was captured April 4, 1980. She has been sentenced to life in prison on
charges including seditious conspiracy. Haydee was the first POW to receive
a life sentence. She was kept in total isolation from the other prisoners of
war and was transferred to a special control unit which limited visits. It
was a year before she was allowed to see her family.

At the MCC in Chicago, she was classified as �no visitors allowed�. Haydee
was subject to physical abuse in interrogations for refusing to implicate
her comrades in unfounded crimes. This was done several times by FBI and
other government agents. These and other inhumane acts by the U.S.
government have led to serious injuries which prison medical directors have
misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received injections of unknown medications.

JOSE IS CURRENTLY IN A HALF WAY HOUSE IN PUERTO RICO FOR THE REMAINDER OF 
HIS SENTENCE!! Jose Perez Gonzalez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on January 
14th, 1968; he
is the son of a butcher and his mother is retired government worker. He is
married with three children. He is well known in his neighborhood, of Barrio 
Segundo in Ponce.
He is a family man with three children. He was a civil disobedient and
served three months in jail for his support activities. Jose was the only
member of the Vieques 12 who went to trial. He was found guilty and was
sentenced to five years in jail. His release is 1/17/2008.

The fight for Puerto Rico's Independence go as far back as indigenous
resistance to Spanish occupation. For well over 500 years, countless and
nameless individuals have fought for our islands sovereignty. Some have paid
the ultimate price with their lives.

Others have been held captive, arrested against their will, by a court which
held no jurisdiction over their cases and tramples on their international
right to fight for the lib-eration of their homeland, our homeland, Puerto
Rico. The Puerto Rican people have been able to free many of our political
prisoners. We did so because we created unity amongst ourselves and because
we welcomed the solidarity of all our allies. This Freedom Al-bum is another
example of our creativity in building solidarity and unity amongst
ourselves.

This album will educate, agitate and help further build our movement to free
our compa�er@s behind the walls.
_______________________________________________________________________________

Our Political Prisoners are:

Oscar Lopez Rivera was born in San Sebastian, Puerto Rico on January 6,
1943. At the age of 12, he moved to Chi-cago with his family. He was a
well-respected community activist and a prominent independence leader for
many years prior to his arrest. Oscar was one of the founders of the Rafael
Cancel Miranda High School, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High
School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was a
com-munity organizer for the Northwest Community Organization (NCO), ASSPA,
ASPIRA and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found
FREE, (a half-way house for convicted drug addicts) and ALAS (an
educa-tional program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois).

He was active in various community struggles, mainly in the area of health
care, employment and police brutality. He also participated in the
development of the Committee to Free the Five Puerto Rican Nationalists. In
1975, he was forced underground, along with other comrades. He was captured
on May 29, 1981, after 5 years of being persecuted by the FBI as one of the
most feared fugitives from US "justice". Oscar, who has a daughter named
Clarissa, is currently serving a 55-year sentence for seditious conspiracy
and other charges. He was convicted of conspiracy to escape along with Jaime
Delgado, (a veteran independence leader), Dora Garcia, (a prominent
community activist) and Kojo Bomani-Sababu, a New Afrikan political
prisoner.

Oscar was one of 13 Puerto Rican political prisoners offered some form of
leniency by the Clinton Administration in the fall of 1999. According to the
Chicago Sun Times, he "declined the president's offer, which still would
have him left with 10 years to serve on conspiracy to escape charges. Now he
faces at least 20 more years in prison. His sister, Zenaida Lopez, said he
turned the offer down because he would be on parole. 'Accepting what they
are offering him is like prison outside of prison,' she said. Zenaida Lopez
said her brother 'was in total agreement' with the decision of the 11 others
to take the conditional clemency." Oscar is presently in prison in Terre
Haute, Indiana and his release date is 7/27/2027.


Carlos Alberto Torres was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on September 19, 1952.
His parents moved to New York, finally settling in Chicago. He studied in
the University of Illinois in Carbondale and Chicago. He studied sociology
at Southern Illinois University and the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Carlos Alberto was involved in the struggles to recruit more Latin@s to the
University, against racism, and police abuse. Carlos was one of the founders
of the Rafael Cancel Miranda Puerto Rican High School now known as the Dr.
Pedro Albizu Campos Puerto Rican High School and participated in the
Committee to Free the 5 Nationalists. In 1976, Carlos was forced to go
underground and was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He was captured along
with other comrades and sentenced to 78 years on charges of seditious
conspiracy, among other charges.

Although the Clinton Administration offered clemency to 12 Puerto Rican
political prisoners in the fall of 1999, no leniency was granted to Carlos
Torres, whom prosecutors described as a leader of the Fuerzas Armadas de
Liberaci�n Nacional (FALN), an underground organization which fought for
Puerto Rico's independence in the 1970s and '80s. His release date is 2024.
He is currently in prison in Oxford, Wisconsin.


Haydee Beltran Torres was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico on June 7, 1955. When
Haydee was 12 years old, her parents moved to Chicago. At Tuley High School,
she organized a boycott that demanded the firing of a racist principal.
Haydee attended the University of Illinois where she was an outspoken
defender of Latino students� rights. Haydee was forced underground in 1976
and was captured April 4, 1980. She has been sentenced to life in prison on
charges including seditious conspiracy. Haydee was the first POW to receive
a life sentence. She was kept in total isolation from the other prisoners of
war and was transferred to a special control unit which limited visits. It
was a year before she was allowed to see her family.

At the MCC in Chicago, she was classified as �no visitors allowed�. Haydee
was subject to physical abuse in interrogations for refusing to implicate
her comrades in unfounded crimes. This was done several times by FBI and
other government agents. These and other inhumane acts by the U.S.
government have led to serious injuries which prison medical directors have
misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received injections of unknown medications.

JOSE IS CURRENTLY IN A HALF WAY HOUSE IN PUERTO RICO FOR THE REMAINDER OF 
HIS SENTENCE!! Jose Perez Gonzalez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on January 
14th, 1968; he
is the son of a butcher and his mother is retired government worker. He is
married with three children. He is well known in his neighborhood, of Barrio 
Segundo in Ponce.
He is a family man with three children. He was a civil disobedient and
served three months in jail for his support activities. Jose was the only
member of the Vieques 12 who went to trial. He was found guilty and was
sentenced to five years in jail. His release is 1/17/2008.

A CALL TO ARTISTS! Calling all Boricua Artists for a Fund
Raising CD to aid our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!

The Welfare Poets and The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign have come together to
collaborate on a fund-raising project to directly aid the current Puerto
Rican Political Prisoners; incarcerated for fighting for the independence
and self-determination of Puerto Rico. Additionally, we would also want to
assist past political prisoners who have been freed and are now attempting
to survive in a system where many channels are closed to them. It is also
our intention to create a general legal fund to assist present and even
possibly future political prisoners.

We are directing this posting to local bands and world renown Puerto Rican
artists who have the eye of the music world. Depending on how many artists
come forward and who actually submit songs, there is a po-tential for us to
get funds so distribution can be created on a larger scale.


Regarding Song Submissions:
�We have begun accepting submissions.
�All submissions and questions about submissions can be sent to:
FreedomAlbum@...
�We want all artist of all genres to be apart of this potentially monumental
album for Freedom -- Bomba, Plena, Hip Hop, Reggaeton, Salsa, Jibaro,
Regggae, Punk, Rock or any other form of music
�Songs do not need to be directly about the political prisoners and the
struggle for Puerto Rico's Indpendence, although we definitely won't
discourage you to do so. For the most part, they should be uplifting and
somehow connected to our people, island, culture and history.


Goal:
�We hope this album serves to raise the necessary funds as outlined above,
but also to unify the Puerto Rican community on many levels. Unifying Puerto
Rican artists from NYC, Chicago, California, Philadelphia, New Jersey and
all over the Puerto Rican Diaspora, with each other and other artists from
the island � all coming together under the banner of supporting those who
have sacrificed everything for the liberation of Puerto Rico.

�We also hope to unify organizations in an attempt to move forward on better
grounds on behalf of the companeros.

�Not only will we be spreading the word about the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners' existence and indi-vidual cases to a wide range of individuals
open their eyes for the first time or updating those who are already in the
know, but we will also be offering the people a way to assist, all people
who support the struggle for our companeros release, Puerto Rican and
beyond.


To Organizations:
�We call on other organizations to help put this album together. There is so
much to be done and time is most precious. Collectively, our efforts can
reach the necessary millions to make a significant impact. These are our
prisoners, they remain in jail and isolated due to our collective inaction
and we can rem-edy this. To endorse thie effort, please email us at

The fight for Puerto Rico's Independence go as far back as indigenous
resistance to Spanish occupation. For well over 500 years, countless and
nameless individuals have fought for our islands sovereignty. Some have paid
the ultimate price with their lives.

Others have been held captive, arrested against their will, by a court which
held no jurisdiction over their cases and tramples on their international
right to fight for the lib-eration of their homeland, our homeland, Puerto
Rico. The Puerto Rican people have been able to free many of our political
prisoners. We did so because we created unity amongst ourselves and because
we welcomed the solidarity of all our allies. This Freedom Al-bum is another
example of our creativity in building solidarity and unity amongst
ourselves.

This album will educate, agitate and help further build our movement to free
our compa�er@s behind the walls.

Our Political Prisoners are:

Oscar Lopez Rivera was born in San Sebastian, Puerto Rico on January 6,
1943. At the age of 12, he moved to Chi-cago with his family. He was a
well-respected community activist and a prominent independence leader for
many years prior to his arrest. Oscar was one of the founders of the Rafael
Cancel Miranda High School, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High
School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was a
com-munity organizer for the Northwest Community Organization (NCO), ASSPA,
ASPIRA and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found
FREE, (a half-way house for convicted drug addicts) and ALAS (an
educa-tional program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois).

He was active in various community struggles, mainly in the area of health
care, employment and police brutality. He also participated in the
development of the Committee to Free the Five Puerto Rican Nationalists. In
1975, he was forced underground, along with other comrades. He was captured
on May 29, 1981, after 5 years of being persecuted by the FBI as one of the
most feared fugitives from US "justice". Oscar, who has a daughter named
Clarissa, is currently serving a 55-year sentence for seditious conspiracy
and other charges. He was convicted of conspiracy to escape along with Jaime
Delgado, (a veteran independence leader), Dora Garcia, (a prominent
community activist) and Kojo Bomani-Sababu, a New Afrikan political
prisoner.

Oscar was one of 13 Puerto Rican political prisoners offered some form of
leniency by the Clinton Administration in the fall of 1999. According to the
Chicago Sun Times, he "declined the president's offer, which still would
have him left with 10 years to serve on conspiracy to escape charges. Now he
faces at least 20 more years in prison. His sister, Zenaida Lopez, said he
turned the offer down because he would be on parole. 'Accepting what they
are offering him is like prison outside of prison,' she said. Zenaida Lopez
said her brother 'was in total agreement' with the decision of the 11 others
to take the conditional clemency." Oscar is presently in prison in Terre
Haute, Indiana and his release date is 7/27/2027.


Carlos Alberto Torres was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on September 19, 1952.
His parents moved to New York, finally settling in Chicago. He studied in
the University of Illinois in Carbondale and Chicago. He studied sociology
at Southern Illinois University and the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Carlos Alberto was involved in the struggles to recruit more Latin@s to the
University, against racism, and police abuse. Carlos was one of the founders
of the Rafael Cancel Miranda Puerto Rican High School now known as the Dr.
Pedro Albizu Campos Puerto Rican High School and participated in the
Committee to Free the 5 Nationalists. In 1976, Carlos was forced to go
underground and was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He was captured along
with other comrades and sentenced to 78 years on charges of seditious
conspiracy, among other charges.

Although the Clinton Administration offered clemency to 12 Puerto Rican
political prisoners in the fall of 1999, no leniency was granted to Carlos
Torres, whom prosecutors described as a leader of the Fuerzas Armadas de
Liberaci�n Nacional (FALN), an underground organization which fought for
Puerto Rico's independence in the 1970s and '80s. His release date is 2024.
He is currently in prison in Oxford, Wisconsin.


Haydee Beltran Torres was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico on June 7, 1955. When
Haydee was 12 years old, her parents moved to Chicago. At Tuley High School,
she organized a boycott that demanded the firing of a racist principal.
Haydee attended the University of Illinois where she was an outspoken
defender of Latino students� rights. Haydee was forced underground in 1976
and was captured April 4, 1980. She has been sentenced to life in prison on
charges including seditious conspiracy. Haydee was the first POW to receive
a life sentence. She was kept in total isolation from the other prisoners of
war and was transferred to a special control unit which limited visits. It
was a year before she was allowed to see her family.

At the MCC in Chicago, she was classified as �no visitors allowed�. Haydee
was subject to physical abuse in interrogations for refusing to implicate
her comrades in unfounded crimes. This was done several times by FBI and
other government agents. These and other inhumane acts by the U.S.
government have led to serious injuries which prison medical directors have
misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received injections of unknown medications.


JOSE IS CURRENTLY IN A HALF WAY HOUSE IN PUERTO RICO FOR THE REMAINDER OF
HIS SENTENCE!! Jose Perez Gonzalez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on January
14th, 1968; he is the son of a butcher and his mother is retired government 
worker. He is
married with three children. He is well known in his neighborhood, of Barrio
Segundo in Ponce.

He is a family man with three children. He was a civil disobedient and
served three months in jail for his support activities. Jose was the only
member of the Vieques 12 who went to trial. He was found guilty and was
sentenced to five years in jail. His release is 1/17/2008.

turned the offer down because he would be on parole. 'Accepting what they
are offering him is like prison outside of prison,' she said. Zenaida Lopez
said her brother 'was in total agreement' with the decision of the 11 others
to take the conditional clemency." Oscar is presently in prison in Terre
Haute, Indiana and his release date is 7/27/2027.

His parents moved to New York, finally settling in Chicago. He studied in
the University of Illinois in Carbondale and Chicago. He studied sociology
at Southern Illinois University and the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Carlos Alberto was involved in the struggles to recruit more Latin@s to the
University, against racism, and police abuse. Carlos was one of the founders

Pedro Albizu Campos Puerto Rican High School and participated in the
Committee to Free the 5 Nationalists. In 1976, Carlos was forced to go
underground and was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He was captured along
with other comrades and sentenced to 78 years on charges of seditious
conspiracy, among other charges.

Although the Clinton Administration offered clemency to 12 Puerto Rican
political prisoners in the fall of 1999, no leniency was granted to Carlos

Liberaci�n Nacional (FALN), an underground organization which fought for
Puerto Rico's independence in the 1970s and '80s. His release date is 2024.
He is currently in prison in Oxford, Wisconsin.

and was captured April 4, 1980. She has been sentenced to life in prison on
charges including seditious conspiracy. Haydee was the first POW to receive
a life sentence. She was kept in total isolation from the other prisoners of
war and was transferred to a special control unit which limited visits. It
was a year before she was allowed to see her family.

At the MCC in Chicago, she was classified as �no visitors allowed�. Haydee
was subject to physical abuse in interrogations for refusing to implicate
her comrades in unfounded crimes. This was done several times by FBI and
other government agents. These and other inhumane acts by the U.S.
government have led to serious injuries which prison medical directors have
misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received injections of unknown medications.


JOSE IS CURRENTLY IN A HALF WAY HOUSE IN PUERTO RICO FOR THE REMAINDER OF
HIS SENTENCE!! Jose Perez Gonzalez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on January

A CALL TO ARTISTS! Calling all Boricua Artists for a Fund
Raising CD to aid our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!

The Welfare Poets and The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign have come together to
collaborate on a fund-raising project to directly aid the current Puerto
Rican Political Prisoners; incarcerated for fighting for the independence
and self-determination of Puerto Rico. Additionally, we would also want to
assist past political prisoners who have been freed and are now attempting
to survive in a system where many channels are closed to them. It is also
our intention to create a general legal fund to assist present and even
possibly future political prisoners.

We are directing this posting to local bands and world renown Puerto Rican
artists who have the eye of the music world. Depending on how many artists
come forward and who actually submit songs, there is a po-tential for us to
get funds so distribution can be created on a larger scale.


Regarding Song Submissions:
�We have begun accepting submissions.
�All submissions and questions about submissions can be sent to:
FreedomAlbum@...
�We want all artist of all genres to be apart of this potentially monumental
album for Freedom -- Bomba, Plena, Hip Hop, Reggaeton, Salsa, Jibaro,
Regggae, Punk, Rock or any other form of music
�Songs do not need to be directly about the political prisoners and the
struggle for Puerto Rico's Indpendence, although we definitely won't
discourage you to do so. For the most part, they should be uplifting and
somehow connected to our people, island, culture and history.


Goal:
�We hope this album serves to raise the necessary funds as outlined above,
but also to unify the Puerto Rican community on many levels. Unifying Puerto
Rican artists from NYC, Chicago, California, Philadelphia, New Jersey and
all over the Puerto Rican Diaspora, with each other and other artists from
the island � all coming together under the banner of supporting those who
have sacrificed everything for the liberation of Puerto Rico.

�We also hope to unify organizations in an attempt to move forward on better
grounds on behalf of the companeros.

�Not only will we be spreading the word about the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners' existence and indi-vidual cases to a wide range of individuals
open their eyes for the first time or updating those who are already in the
know, but we will also be offering the people a way to assist, all people
who support the struggle for our companeros release, Puerto Rican and
beyond.


To Organizations:
�We call on other organizations to help put this album together. There is so
much to be done and time is most precious. Collectively, our efforts can
reach the necessary millions to make a significant impact. These are our
prisoners, they remain in jail and isolated due to our collective inaction
and we can rem-edy this. To endorse thie effort, please email us at
freedomalbum@...

regarding the project and planning meetings



The fight for Puerto Rico's Independence go as far back as indigenous
resistance to Spanish occupation. For well over 500 years, countless and
nameless individuals have fought for our islands sovereignty. Some have paid
the ultimate price with their lives.

Others have been held captive, arrested against their will, by a court which
held no jurisdiction over their cases and tramples on their international
right to fight for the lib-eration of their homeland, our homeland, Puerto
Rico. The Puerto Rican people have been able to free many of our political
prisoners. We did so because we created unity amongst ourselves and because
we welcomed the solidarity of all our allies. This Freedom Al-bum is another
example of our creativity in building solidarity and unity amongst
ourselves.

This album will educate, agitate and help further build our movement to free
our compa�er@s behind the walls.

and other charges. He was convicted of conspiracy to escape along with Jaime
Delgado, (a veteran independence leader), Dora Garcia, (a prominent
community activist) and Kojo Bomani-Sababu, a New Afrikan political
prisoner.

Oscar was one of 13 Puerto Rican political prisoners offered some form of

her comrades in unfounded crimes. This was done several times by FBI and
other government agents. These and other inhumane acts by the U.S.
government have led to serious injuries which prison medical directors have
misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received injections of unknown medications.

Join us Sunday, September 23rd in a march and rally for Puerto Rican 
independence and self-determination.

Puerto Rico is the oldest colony on the planet, first invaded by Spain in 
1493, then in 1898 by the United States. After 109 years, it continues under 
U.S. colonial rule.

Within those 500 plus years of invasion and occupation, the Puerto Rican 
people have been engaged in anti-imperialist/ anti-colonial resistance that 
continues to this day.

The Significance of the September 23rd date
September 23rd, 1868 is traditionally celebrated and commemorated as the 
birth of the Puerto Rican nation, when Puerto Ricans rose up against Spanish 
colonial rule in a revolt known as El Grito de Lares.  By 1898, Puerto Rico 
had achieved a form of autonomous self-rule, which came to an end later that 
year with the United States invasion of the island during the Spanish- 
American War.  Puerto Rico has been under the political rule of the United 
States ever since and has continued to struggle throughout that time for its 
independence and self-determination.

Well aware of this date's significance to the independence movement, on 
September 23rd, 2005, U.S. FBI agents assassinated Filiberto Ojeda Rios. 
Comandante Filiberto, who founded el Ejercito Popular Boricua (the Puerto 
Rican People’s Army) – Los Macheteros, was a revered revolutionary 
leader of the Puerto Rican liberation struggle.  The assassination of 
Filiberto on this date was a clear attempt to kill the spirit of the ongoing 
Puerto Rican liberation struggle.

Why the UN location?
In spite of their attempt to kill our spirit, the FBI assassination of Ojeda 
Rios served to rally additional support for the independence movement.  
Since his death, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization 
voted unanimously on a resolution calling for the Decolonization of Puerto 
Rico. This resolution, in addition to several declarations made on the 
colonial situation of the island reiterates: “the Puerto Rican people 
constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation that has its own 
unequivocal national identity.” If picked up by the UN General Assembly 
the Puerto Rican status question will be addressed in September of 2008. 
This historical decision would put Puerto Rico’s status issue on the UN 
agenda for the first time since 1953. The September 23rd march will rally 
national and international support so that the United Nations will make it a 
priority to resolve the colonial situation in Puerto Rico once and for all, 
through its natural right to be a free nation.

What, when and where?:
On Sunday, September 23rd of 2007:

12PM Begin gathering at Times Square (Broadway between 41st &amp; 42nd)
1PM:  Begin marching towards the United Nations
2PM:  Rally at the UN- Dag Hammarskjold Plaza featuring speakers from Puerto 
Rican and ally communities and live hip hop and bomba performances.

A CALL TO ARTISTS! Calling all Boricua Artists for a Fund
Raising CD to aid our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!

The Welfare Poets and The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign have come together to
collaborate on a fund-raising project to directly aid the current Puerto
Rican Political Prisoners; incarcerated for fighting for the independence
and self-determination of Puerto Rico. Additionally, we would also want to
assist past political prisoners who have been freed and are now attempting
to survive in a system where many channels are closed to them. It is also
our intention to create a general legal fund to assist present and even
possibly future political prisoners.

We are directing this posting to local bands and world renown Puerto Rican
artists who have the eye of the music world. Depending on how many artists
come forward and who actually submit songs, there is a po-tential for us to
get funds so distribution can be created on a larger scale.


Regarding Song Submissions:
�We have begun accepting submissions.
�All submissions and questions about submissions can be sent to:
FreedomAlbum@...
�We want all artist of all genres to be apart of this potentially monumental
album for Freedom -- Bomba, Plena, Hip Hop, Reggaeton, Salsa, Jibaro,
Regggae, Punk, Rock or any other form of music
�Songs do not need to be directly about the political prisoners and the
struggle for Puerto Rico's Indpendence, although we definitely won't
discourage you to do so. For the most part, they should be uplifting and
somehow connected to our people, island, culture and history.


Goal:
�We hope this album serves to raise the necessary funds as outlined above,
but also to unify the Puerto Rican community on many levels. Unifying Puerto
Rican artists from NYC, Chicago, California, Philadelphia, New Jersey and
all over the Puerto Rican Diaspora, with each other and other artists from
the island � all coming together under the banner of supporting those who
have sacrificed everything for the liberation of Puerto Rico.

�We also hope to unify organizations in an attempt to move forward on better
grounds on behalf of the companeros.

�Not only will we be spreading the word about the Puerto Rican Political
Prisoners' existence and indi-vidual cases to a wide range of individuals
open their eyes for the first time or updating those who are already in the
know, but we will also be offering the people a way to assist, all people
who support the struggle for our companeros release, Puerto Rican and
beyond.


To Organizations:
�We call on other organizations to help put this album together. There is so
much to be done and time is most precious. Collectively, our efforts can
reach the necessary millions to make a significant impact. These are our
prisoners, they remain in jail and isolated due to our collective inaction
and we can rem-edy this. To endorse thie effort, please email us at
freedomalbum@...

The fight for Puerto Rico's Independence go as far back as indigenous
resistance to Spanish occupation. For well over 500 years, countless and
nameless individuals have fought for our islands sovereignty. Some have paid
the ultimate price with their lives.

Others have been held captive, arrested against their will, by a court which
held no jurisdiction over their cases and tramples on their international
right to fight for the lib-eration of their homeland, our homeland, Puerto
Rico. The Puerto Rican people have been able to free many of our political
prisoners. We did so because we created unity amongst ourselves and because
we welcomed the solidarity of all our allies. This Freedom Al-bum is another
example of our creativity in building solidarity and unity amongst
ourselves.

This album will educate, agitate and help further build our movement to free
our compa�er@s behind the walls.


Our Political Prisoners are:

Oscar Lopez Rivera was born in San Sebastian, Puerto Rico on January 6,
1943. At the age of 12, he moved to Chi-cago with his family. He was a
well-respected community activist and a prominent independence leader for
many years prior to his arrest. Oscar was one of the founders of the Rafael
Cancel Miranda High School, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High
School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was a
com-munity organizer for the Northwest Community Organization (NCO), ASSPA,
ASPIRA and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found
FREE, (a half-way house for convicted drug addicts) and ALAS (an
educa-tional program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois).

He was active in various community struggles, mainly in the area of health
care, employment and police brutality. He also participated in the
development of the Committee to Free the Five Puerto Rican Nationalists. In
1975, he was forced underground, along with other comrades. He was captured
on May 29, 1981, after 5 years of being persecuted by the FBI as one of the
most feared fugitives from US "justice". Oscar, who has a daughter named
Clarissa, is currently serving a 55-year sentence for seditious conspiracy
and other charges. He was convicted of conspiracy to escape along with Jaime
Delgado, (a veteran independence leader), Dora Garcia, (a prominent
community activist) and Kojo Bomani-Sababu, a New Afrikan political
prisoner.

Oscar was one of 13 Puerto Rican political prisoners offered some form of
leniency by the Clinton Administration in the fall of 1999. According to the
Chicago Sun Times, he "declined the president's offer, which still would
have him left with 10 years to serve on conspiracy to escape charges. Now he
faces at least 20 more years in prison. His sister, Zenaida Lopez, said he
turned the offer down because he would be on parole. 'Accepting what they
are offering him is like prison outside of prison,' she said. Zenaida Lopez
said her brother 'was in total agreement' with the decision of the 11 others
to take the conditional clemency." Oscar is presently in prison in Terre
Haute, Indiana and his release date is 7/27/2027.


Carlos Alberto Torres was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on September 19, 1952.
His parents moved to New York, finally settling in Chicago. He studied in
the University of Illinois in Carbondale and Chicago. He studied sociology
at Southern Illinois University and the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Carlos Alberto was involved in the struggles to recruit more Latin@s to the
University, against racism, and police abuse. Carlos was one of the founders
of the Rafael Cancel Miranda Puerto Rican High School now known as the Dr.
Pedro Albizu Campos Puerto Rican High School and participated in the
Committee to Free the 5 Nationalists. In 1976, Carlos was forced to go
underground and was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He was captured along
with other comrades and sentenced to 78 years on charges of seditious
conspiracy, among other charges.

Although the Clinton Administration offered clemency to 12 Puerto Rican
political prisoners in the fall of 1999, no leniency was granted to Carlos
Torres, whom prosecutors described as a leader of the Fuerzas Armadas de
Liberaci�n Nacional (FALN), an underground organization which fought for
Puerto Rico's independence in the 1970s and '80s. His release date is 2024.
He is currently in prison in Oxford, Wisconsin.


Haydee Beltran Torres was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico on June 7, 1955. When
Haydee was 12 years old, her parents moved to Chicago. At Tuley High School,
she organized a boycott that demanded the firing of a racist principal.
Haydee attended the University of Illinois where she was an outspoken
defender of Latino students� rights. Haydee was forced underground in 1976
and was captured April 4, 1980. She has been sentenced to life in prison on
charges including seditious conspiracy. Haydee was the first POW to receive
a life sentence. She was kept in total isolation from the other prisoners of
war and was transferred to a special control unit which limited visits. It
was a year before she was allowed to see her family.

At the MCC in Chicago, she was classified as �no visitors allowed�. Haydee
was subject to physical abuse in interrogations for refusing to implicate
her comrades in unfounded crimes. This was done several times by FBI and
other government agents. These and other inhumane acts by the U.S.
government have led to serious injuries which prison medical directors have
misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received injections of unknown medications.


JOSE IS CURRENTLY IN A HALF WAY HOUSE IN PUERTO RICO FOR THE REMAINDER OF
HIS SENTENCE!! Jose Perez Gonzalez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on January
14th, 1968; he is the son of a butcher and his mother is retired government
worker. He is married with three children. He is well known in his 
neighborhood, of Barrio
Segundo in Ponce.

He is a family man with three children. He was a civil disobedient and
served three months in jail for his support activities. Jose was the only
member of the Vieques 12 who went to trial. He was found guilty and was
sentenced to five years in jail. His release is 1/17/2008.

Join us Sunday, September 23rd in a march and rally for Puerto Rican
independence and self-determination.

Puerto Rico is the oldest colony on the planet, first invaded by Spain in
1493, then in 1898 by the United States. After 109 years, it continues under
U.S. colonial rule.

Within those 500 plus years of invasion and occupation, the Puerto Rican
people have been engaged in anti-imperialist/ anti-colonial resistance that
continues to this day.

The Significance of the September 23rd date
September 23rd, 1868 is traditionally celebrated and commemorated as the
birth of the Puerto Rican nation, when Puerto Ricans rose up against Spanish
colonial rule in a revolt known as El Grito de Lares.  By 1898, Puerto Rico
had achieved a form of autonomous self-rule, which came to an end later that
year with the United States invasion of the island during the Spanish-
American War.  Puerto Rico has been under the political rule of the United
States ever since and has continued to struggle throughout that time for its
independence and self-determination.

Well aware of this date's significance to the independence movement, on
September 23rd, 2005, U.S. FBI agents assassinated Filiberto Ojeda Rios.
Comandante Filiberto, who founded el Ejercito Popular Boricua (the Puerto
Rican People’s Army) – Los Macheteros, was a revered revolutionary
leader of the Puerto Rican liberation struggle.  The assassination of
Filiberto on this date was a clear attempt to kill the spirit of the ongoing
Puerto Rican liberation struggle.

Why the UN location?
In spite of their attempt to kill our spirit, the FBI assassination of Ojeda
Rios served to rally additional support for the independence movement.
Since his death, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization
voted unanimously on a resolution calling for the Decolonization of Puerto
Rico. This resolution, in addition to several declarations made on the
colonial situation of the island reiterates: “the Puerto Rican people
constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation that has its own
unequivocal national identity.” If picked up by the UN General Assembly
the Puerto Rican status question will be addressed in September of 2008.
This historical decision would put Puerto Rico’s status issue on the UN
agenda for the first time since 1953. The September 23rd march will rally
national and international support so that the United Nations will make it a
priority to resolve the colonial situation in Puerto Rico once and for all,
through its natural right to be a free nation.

What, when and where?:
On Sunday, September 23rd of 2007:

12PM Begin gathering at Times Square (Broadway between 41st &amp; 42nd)
1PM:  Begin marching towards the United Nations

MENSAJE DE OSCAR L�PEZ RIVERA
ACTO DEL GRITO DE LARES
23 de septiembre de 2007


Saludos cari�osos y patri�ticos para todos(as):

�Gerardo, Antonio, Ram�n Fernando y Ren� volver�n� reza la consigna del 
pueblo cubano que lucha por la libertad de sus cinco h�roes injustamente 
encarcelados y condenados a excesivas penas en mazmorras del imperio yanki.  
Diariamente este mensaje es transmitido al mundo por la radio cubana.  Y ya 
m�s de 300 grupos por todo el planeta se han solidarizado en �sta causa y 
est�n exigiendo justicia y libertad para estos compa�eros.  Hoy, cuando 
conmemoramos nuestro glorioso Grito de Lares, gritamos:  �Gerardo, Antonio, 
Ram�n Fernando y Ren� volver�n��.

Nos incumbe a todos(as) los(as) boricuas que amamos la justicia y la 
libertad ser solidarios y luchar por la liberaci�n de estos h�roes y 
compa�eros.  Ellos son presos del imperio yanki porque con su valor e 
inteligencia lograron infiltrar organizaciones terroristas de la derecha 
cubana americana que viene cometiendo atrocidades contra el pueblo cubano y 
su Revoluci�n por casi 50 a�os.  Son las organizaciones terroristas que 
asesinaron a los 73 pasajeros de Cubana de Aviaci�n en Barbados con una 
bomba, los que asesinaron a Orlando Letelier y Randy Moffet en Washington y 
los que tienen a la comunidad cubana en yankilandia terrorizada.  Son los 
que han cometido fechor�as y ataques terroristas contra el independentismo y 
los responsables por el vil asesinato del compa�ero Carlos Mu�iz Varela.

Los terroristas de esas organizaciones tienen nombre y apellido, cuentan con 
licencia e impunidad, fomentan la corrupci�n y participan en el tr�fico 
ilegal de drogas.  Es el gobierno estadounidense el que le da licencia, 
santuario, impunidad, recursos y dinero.  Son sus mercenarios y sus 
terroristas.  Son esos viles y brutales canalladas los que cinco compa�eros 
estaban tratando de parar.

La libertad de los cinco es nuestra libertad.  Que ellos vuelvan a su Patria 
y nosotros a la nuestra.  La lucha sigue...Filiberto vive.  �Qu� viva Puerto 
Rico Libre!

En resistencia y lucha,

Oscar L�pez Rivera

Oscar L�pez Rivera es prisionero pol�tico puertorrique�o desde el 29 de mayo

MENSAJE EN EL GRITO DE LARES 2007 DE Carlos Alberto Torres
Prisionero pol�tico puertorrique�o desde el 4 de abril de 1980, hace 27 
a�os.

Un saludo lleno de aprecio y calor patri�tico a todos los presentes que hoy 
unidos conmemoramos esta fecha tan gloriosa en nuestra historia.

Hoy celebramos la valent�a y compromiso con la patria, recordamos a nuestros 
h�roes y m�rtires que por amor a nuestro pueblo nos brindaron el m�s supremo 
sacrificio.  En este d�a sagrado que pertenece a todos los puertorrique�os 
que aman la libertad, rendimos homenaje a ese noble hijo de la patria, el 
comandante Filiberto Ojeda R�os.  Su ejemplo de valor y sacrificio fue lo 
que los asesinos no pudieron, ni jam�s podr�an, matar.

Recordamos tambi�n a los preso pol�ticos puertorrique�os, a los cubanos, que 
hoy comparten con nosotros las rejas y alambres carcelarias que mejor 
caracterizan el comportamiento del gobierno de los Estados Unidos contra los 
pueblos que luchan por el progreso y bien de su gente.

Compatriotas, Lares simboliza la esperanza.  La fe que podemos sentir por 
nuestra capacidad en superar los atropellos y contratiempos que nos imponen 
los enemigos de nuestra libertad.  Lares simboliza la solidaridad humana que 
no s�lo ata a los puertorrique�os uno al otro, sino, a todos los pueblos 
latinoamericanos que forman una gran familia de seres.  Lares es s�mbolo de 
la dignidad humana que aspira la independencia.

Porque Lares es s�mbolo de nuestro amor por la libertad, saludo con gratitud 
a todos los Lares de este planeta: a Venezuela, a Cuba, a Bolivia, a Chiapas 
y  todos los lugares d�nde se lucha por la libertad.

�Viva Puerto Rico libre!
�Viva la memoria del comandante Filiberto Ojeda R�os!
�Libertad para los presos pol�ticos puertorrique�os y cubanos!

A CALL TO CONCERNED ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS

Calling all Boricua Organizations and individuals regarding a Fund Raising 
CD to aid our Puerto Rican Political Prisoners!!


The Freedom Album

The Welfare Poets, The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign and Boricuation have 
come together to collaborate on a fund raising project to directly aid the 
current Puerto Rican Political Prisoners --  incarcerated for fighting for 
the independence and self-determination of Puerto Rico.   Additionally, we 
would also want to assist past political prisoners who have been freed and 
are now attempting to survive in a system where many channels are closed to 
them. It is also our intention to create a general legal fund to assist 
present and even possibly future political prisoners.

We are directing postings to local bands and world renown Puerto Rican 
artists who have the eye of the music world. Depending on how many artists 
come forward and who actually submit songs, there is a potential for us to 
get funds so distribution can be created on a larger scale.

To Organizations:
The project is just in the planning stage, and we want to open this process 
up to other organizations and individuals in an effort to create a even more 
grass-rooted foundation and support.  There is so much to be done and time 
is most precious. Collectively, our efforts can reach the necessary millions 
to make a significant impact. These are our prisoners, they remain in jail 
and isolated due to our collective inaction  and we can remedy this. To join 
the effort, please email us at freedomalbum@...


Goals of the project:
�We hope this album serves to raise the necessary funds as outlined above, 
  but also to unify the Puerto Rican community on many levels. Unifying 
Puerto Rican artists from NYC, Chicago, California, Philadelphia, New Jersey 
and all over the Puerto Rican Diaspora, with each other and other artists 
from  the island � all coming together under the banner of supporting 
those who have sacrificed everything for the love of freedom.

�We also hope to unify organizations in an attempt to move forward on 
better grounds on behalf of the companeros .

�Not only will we be spreading the word about the Puerto Rican Political 
Prisoners' existence and individual cases to a wide range of individuals 
open their eyes for the first time or updating those who are already in the 
know, but we will also be offering the people a way to assist, all people 
who support the struggle for our companeros release, Puerto Rican and 
beyond.


The next meeting:

MONDAY OCTOBER 15th, 2007 AT 7PM at Hunter College East Building
The Center for Puerto Rican Studies 14th floor room 1441.

Background
The fight for Puerto Rico's Independence go as far back as indigenous 
resistance to Spanish occupation. For well over 500 years, countless and 
nameless individuals have fought for our islands sovereignty. Some have paid 
  the ultimate price with their lives.

Others have been held captive, arrested against their will, by a court which 
held no jurisdiction over their cases and tramples on their international 
right to fight for the liberation of their homeland, our homeland, Puerto  
Rico. The Puerto Rican people have been able to free many of our political 
prisoners. We did so because we created unity amongst ourselves and because 
we welcomed the solidarity of all our allies. This Freedom Al-bum is another 
  example of our creativity in building solidarity and unity amongst 
ourselves.

This album will educate, agitate and help further build our movement to free 
our companeros behind the walls.
_______________________________________________________________________________

Our Political Prisoners are:

Oscar Lopez Rivera was born in San Sebastian, Puerto Rico on January 6, 
1943. At the age of 12, he moved to Chicago with his family. He was a 
well-respected community activist and a prominent independence leader for  
many years prior to his arrest. Oscar was one of the founders of the Rafael 
Cancel Miranda High School, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High 
School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was a 
  community organizer for the Northwest Community Organization (NCO), ASSPA, 
ASPIRA and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found 
FREE, (a half-way house for convicted drug addicts) and ALAS (an  
educational program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois ).

He was active in various community struggles, mainly in the area of health 
care, employment and police brutality. He also participated in the  
development of the Committee to Free the Five Puerto Rican Nationalists. In 
1975, he was forced underground, along with other comrades. He was captured 
on May 29, 1981, after 5 years of being persecuted by the FBI as one of the  
most feared fugitives from US "justice". Oscar, who has a daughter named 
Clarissa, is currently serving a 55-year sentence for seditious conspiracy 
and other charges. He was convicted of conspiracy to escape along with Jaime 
  Delgado, (a veteran independence leader), Dora Garcia, (a prominent 
community activist) and Kojo Bomani-Sababu, a New Afrikan political 
prisoner.

Oscar was one of 13 Puerto Rican political prisoners offered some form of  
leniency by the Clinton Administration in the fall of 1999. According to the 
Chicago Sun Times, he "declined the president's offer, which still would 
have him left with 10 years to serve on conspiracy to escape charges. Now he 
  faces at least 20 more years in prison. His sister, Zenaida Lopez, said he 
turned the offer down because he would be on parole. 'Accepting what they 
are offering him is like prison outside of prison,' she said. Zenaida Lopez  
said her brother 'was in total agreement' with the decision of the 11 others 
to take the conditional clemency." Oscar is presently in prison in Terre 
Haute, Indiana and his release date is 7/27/2027.


Carlos Alberto Torres was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on September 19, 1952. 
His parents moved to New York , finally settling in Chicago. He studied in 
the University of Illinois in Carbondale and Chicago. He studied sociology  
at Southern Illinois University and the University of Illinois at Chicago . 
Carlos Alberto was involved in the struggles to recruit more Latin@s to the 
University, against racism, and police abuse. Carlos was one of the founders 
  of the Rafael Cancel Miranda Puerto Rican High School now known as the Dr. 
Pedro Albizu Campos Puerto Rican High School and participated in the 
Committee to Free the 5 Nationalists. In 1976, Carlos was forced to go  
underground and was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list. He was captured along 
with other comrades and sentenced to 78 years on charges of seditious 
conspiracy, among other charges.

Although the Clinton Administration offered clemency to 12 Puerto Rican  
political prisoners in the fall of 1999, no leniency was granted to Carlos 
Torres, whom prosecutors described as a leader of the Fuerzas Armadas de 
Liberaci�n Nacional (FALN), an underground organization which fought for  
Puerto Rico's independence in the 1970s and '80s. His release date is 2024. 
He is currently in prison in Oxford, Wisconsin.


Haydee Beltran Torres was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico on June 7, 1955. When 
  Haydee was 12 years old, her parents moved to Chicago. At Tuley High 
School, she organized a boycott that demanded the firing of a racist 
principal. Haydee attended the University of Illinois where she was an 
outspoken  defender of Latino students' rights. Haydee was forced 
underground in 1976 and was captured April 4, 1980. She has been sentenced 
to life in prison on charges including seditious conspiracy. Haydee was the 
first POW to receive  a life sentence. She was kept in total isolation from 
the other prisoners of war and was transferred to a special control unit 
which limited visits. It was a year before she was allowed to see her 
family.

At the MCC in Chicago, she was classified as "no visitors allowed". Haydee 
was subject to physical abuse in interrogations for refusing to implicate 
her comrades in unfounded crimes. This was done several times by FBI and  
other government agents. These and other inhumane acts by the U.S. 
government have led to serious injuries which prison medical directors have 
misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received injections of unknown medications.


Jose Perez Gonzalez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on January 14th, 1968; he 
is the son of a butcher and his mother is retired government worker. He is 
married with three children. He is a member of Mayaguezano por La Salud y el 
  Ambiente. He is well known in his neighborhood, of Barrio Segundo in Ponce 
. He is a family man with three children. He was a civil disobedient and 
served three months in jail for his support activities. Jose was the only  
member of the Vieques 12 who went to trial. He was found guilty and was 
sentenced to five years in jail. His release is 1/17/2008.

Haydee Beltran Torres was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico on June 7, 1955. When 
  Haydee was 12 years old, her parents moved to Chicago. At Tuley High 
School, she organized a boycott that demanded the firing of a racist 
principal. Haydee attended the University of Illinois where she was an 
outspoken  defender of Latino students' rights. Haydee was forced 
underground in 1976 and was captured April 4, 1980. She has been sentenced 
to life in prison on charges including seditious conspiracy. Haydee was the 
first POW to receive  a life sentence. She was kept in total isolation from 
the other prisoners of war and was transferred to a special control unit 
which limited visits. It was a year before she was allowed to see her 
family.

At the MCC in Chicago, she was classified as "no visitors allowed". Haydee 
was subject to physical abuse in interrogations for refusing to implicate 
her comrades in unfounded crimes. This was done several times by FBI and  
other government agents. These and other inhumane acts by the U.S. 
government have led to serious injuries which prison medical directors have 
misdiagnosed; also, Haydee has received injections of unknown medications.


Jose Perez Gonzalez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on January 14th, 1968; he 
is the son of a butcher and his mother is retired government worker. He is 
married with three children. He is a member of Mayaguezano por La Salud y el 
  Ambiente. He is well known in his neighborhood, of Barrio Segundo in Ponce 
. He is a family man with three children. He was a civil disobedient and 
served three months in jail for his support activities. Jose was the only  
member of the Vieques 12 who went to trial. He was found guilty and was 
sentenced to five years in jail. His release is 1/17/2008.

A CALL TO ARTISTS!

Calling all Boricua Artists for a Fund Raising CD to aid our Puerto Rican 
Political Prisoners!!
The Freedom Album

The Welfare Poets, The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign and Boricuation have 
initiated a fund raising project to directly aid the current Puerto Rican 
Political Prisoners; incarcerated for fighting for the independence and 
self-determination of Puerto Rico.  Additionally, we also want to assist 
past political prisoners who have been freed and are now attempting to 
survive in a system where many channels are closed to them. It is also our 
intention to create a general legal fund to assist present and even possibly 
future political prisoners.  Other organizations and individuals will join 
in on the effort of putting an album of this magnitude  together.  There is 
so  much to be done and time is most precious. Collectively, our efforts can 
reach the necessary millions to make a significant impact. These are our 
prisoners, they remain in jail and isolated due to our collective inaction  
and we can remedy this.

We are directing this posting to local bands and world renown Puerto Rican 
artists who have the eye of the music world. Depending on how many artists 
come forward and who actually submit songs, there is a potential for us to 
get funds so distribution can be created on a larger scale.


Regarding Song Submissions:
�We have begun accepting submissions. All submissions must be 
submitted by December 31st 2007
�All submissions and questions about submissions can be sent to: 
FreedomAlbum@...
(Unfortunately, not all submissions will be accepted.  We are expecting a 
huge amount of submissions and a committee will be coordinated to do the 
final selection.  If your song is accepted, we will eventually need the a CD 
of the studio sessions to be sent for mixing and mastering)
�We want all bands/artist of all genres to be a part of this 
potentially monumental album for Freedom -- Bomba, Plena, Hip Hop, 
Reggaeton, Salsa, Jibaro, Regggae, Punk, Rock or any other form of music
�Songs do not need to be directly about the political prisoners and 
the struggle for Puerto Rico's Independence, although we definitely won't  
discourage you to do so. For the most part, they should be uplifting and 
somehow connected to our people, island, culture and history.


Goal:
�We hope this album serves to raise the necessary funds as outlined 
above,  but also to unify the Puerto Rican community on many levels. 
Unifying Puerto Rican artists from NYC, Chicago, California, Philadelphia, 
New Jersey and all over the Puerto Rican Diaspora, with each other and other 
artists from  the island � all coming together under the banner of 
supporting those who have sacrificed everything for the love of freedom.

�We also hope to unify organizations in an attempt to move forward on 
better grounds on behalf of the companeros.

�Not only will we be spreading the word about the Puerto Rican 
Political Prisoners' existence and individual cases to a wide range of 
individuals open their eyes for the first time or updating those who are 
already in the know, but we will also be offering the people a way to 
assist, all people who support the struggle for our companeros release, 
Puerto Rican and beyond.

information regarding the project and planning meetings


Background
The fight for Puerto Rico's Independence go as far back as indigenous 
resistance to Spanish occupation. For well over 500 years, countless and 
nameless individuals have fought for our islands sovereignty. Some have paid 
  the ultimate price with their lives.

Others have been held captive, arrested against their will, by a court which 
held no jurisdiction over their cases and tramples on their international 
right to fight for the liberation of their homeland, our homeland, Puerto  
Rico. The Puerto Rican people have been able to free many of our political 
prisoners. We did so because we created unity amongst ourselves and because 
we welcomed the solidarity of all our allies. This Freedom Al-bum is another 
  example of our creativity in building solidarity and unity amongst 
ourselves.

This album will educate, agitate and help further build our movement to free 
our companeros behind the walls.

PLANNING MEETING FOR THE NYC CUBAN 5 ORGANIZER'S CONFERENCE

Join us on Monday October 29th, 2007 at 7pm Hunter College Center for PR
Studies East Building 14th floor Room 1441 E68th St. and Lexington Avenue 6
train to 68th St. Stop

Inspired by the upcoming Cuban 5conference on November 9th-11th in Canada,
the Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 feels it is important that
such an event occurr in New York City in the Spring 2008. Now is the time
to begin planning for a powerful conference that will inspire, educate, and
mobilize people to do work around our five heroes.

The Project is calling on all supporters of Cuba, the work to free the Cuban
5 and all freedom loving people to come together to begin the planning of a
New York City/East Coast Organizer's conference to further build and
stregthen work to free the Cuban 5.

CUBA NEEDS US! THE CUBAN 5 NEED US! WORK TO FREE THE CUBAN FIVE!

Benjamin Ramos
Frank Velgara
The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5

Who are the Cuban 5?

The Cuban 5 were arrested in September 1998, spent 17 months in solidarity
confinement, and were convicted in June 2001 in a U.S. federal court for
defending their country of Cuba from terrorists based in Miami. They were
convicted after a politically charged trial in Miami, in which the U.S.
government charged them with threatening national security and conspiracy to
commit espionage. Nothing could be further from the truth, the Cuban 5
infiltrated Cuban-American right-wing terrorist organizations based in Miami
to monitor their actions and to protect the national sovereignty of their
homeland Cuba. The Cuban 5 shared the information with U.S. officials when
dangerous actions were planned by these terrorist organizations. The judge,
prosecution and U.S. government officials suppressed defense evidence and
made sure that key witnesses for the defense would not testify. No
espionage evidence was ever introduced and it was found that the information
that the Cuban 5 had was public information that did not threaten national
security. The Cuban 5 are not terrorists they are patriots defending their
homeland, Cuba!

Join the international movement to free these innocent men!!

Celebrate and defend the legacy of the Black Panther Party:

Drop the charges against the SF-8

NYC, Friday, November 30, 7 pm
Martin Luther King Jr. Labor Center
310 W. 43rd Street (between 8th &amp; 9th Ave.) NYC

Speakers Include: Gil Noble, respected producer and host of ABC-TV's Like It
Is Francisco Torres, Harold Taylor and other SF-8 defendants
Soffiyah Elijah, Esq., lawyer on the SF-8 case
Performing: alixa + naima/Climbing Poetree

The San Francisco 8 are eight former "original" Black Panther Party members
and active supporters (ages 56 to 72), who were arrested last January in
California, New York and Florida on charges related to the 1971 killing of a
San Francisco police officer. Some of these men faced virtually identical
charges almost 35 years ago�charges that were dropped after it was revealed
that police torture had extracted "confessions."

But that was in 1973. Now that torture has been made acceptable in this
country, the case is back on�based on the same flawed evidence.

The judge has released the 6 bail-eligible defendants on bond, suggesting to
legal experts that this case is a shaky one.

Two of the 8 defendants�political prisoners Herman Bell and Jalil
Muntaqim�are not eligible for bail. They remain in jail in San Francisco,
having already served more than 34 years in New York state prisons. This new
case charges them again with actions for which they are already doing time.

Learn more about the case and welcome home defendant Cisco Torres, released
on bail, now back with his family in Queens, New York.

Hunter College Center for PRStudies 
East Building 14th floor Room 1441 E68th St. and Lexington Avenue 
6 train to 68th St. Stop 


Inspired by the upcoming Cuban 5conference on November 9th-11th in Canada,the Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 feels it is important that such an event occurr in New York City in the Spring 2008. 

Now is the time to begin planning for a powerful conference that will inspire, educate, andmobilize people to do work around our five heroes. The Project is calling on all supporters of Cuba, the work to free the Cuban5 and all freedom loving people to come together to begin the planning of aNew York City/East Coast Organizer's conference to further build andstregthen work to free the Cuban 5. 

CUBA NEEDS US! 
THE CUBAN 5 NEED US! 
WORK TO FREE THE CUBAN FIVE! 
Benjamin Ramos
Frank Velgara
The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 

Who are the Cuban 5? 

The Cuban 5 were arrested in September 1998, spent 17 months in solidarityconfinement, and were convicted in June 2001 in a U.S. federal court fordefending their country of Cuba from terrorists based in Miami. They wereconvicted after a politically charged trial in Miami, in which the U.S.government charged them with threatening national security and conspiracy tocommit espionage. Nothing could be further from the truth, the Cuban 5infiltrated Cuban-American right-wing terrorist organizations based in Miamito monitor their actions and to protect the national sovereignty of theirhomeland Cuba. The Cuban 5 shared the information with U.S. officials whendangerous actions were planned by these terrorist organizations. The judge,prosecution and U.S. government officials suppressed defense evidence andmade sure that key witnesses for the defense would not testify. Noespionage evidence was ever introduced and it was found that the informationthat the Cuban 5 had was public information that did not threaten nationalsecurity. The Cuban 5 are not terrorists they are patriots defending theirhomeland, Cuba! Join the international movement to free these innocent men!!

<pre>Even if you have no erection problems Viagra would help you to make better sex more often and to bring unimaginable plesure to her. Just disolve half a pill under your tongue and get ready for action in 30 minutes. The tests showed that the majority of men after taking this medication were able to have perfect erection during 24 hours!

Drop the charges against the SF-8

NYC, Friday, November 30, 7 pm
Martin Luther King Jr. Labor Center
310 W. 43rd Street (between 8th &amp; 9th Ave.) NYC

Speakers Include: Gil Noble, respected producer and host of ABC-TV's Like It
Is Francisco Torres, Harold Taylor and other SF-8 defendants
Soffiyah Elijah, Esq., lawyer on the SF-8 case
Performing: alixa + naima/Climbing Poetree

The San Francisco 8 are eight former "original" Black Panther Party members
and active supporters (ages 56 to 72), who were arrested last January in
California, New York and Florida on charges related to the 1971 killing of a
San Francisco police officer. Some of these men faced virtually identical
charges almost 35 years ago�charges that were dropped after it was revealed
that police torture had extracted "confessions."

But that was in 1973. Now that torture has been made acceptable in this
country, the case is back on�based on the same flawed evidence.

The judge has released the 6 bail-eligible defendants on bond, suggesting to
legal experts that this case is a shaky one.

Two of the 8 defendants�political prisoners Herman Bell and Jalil
Muntaqim�are not eligible for bail. They remain in jail in San Francisco,
having already served more than 34 years in New York state prisons. This new
case charges them again with actions for which they are already doing time.

Learn more about the case and welcome home defendant Cisco Torres, released
on bail, now back with his family in Queens, New York.

But that was in 1973. Now that torture has been made acceptable in this
country, the case is back on�based on the same flawed evidence.

The judge has released the 6 bail-eligible defendants on bond, suggesting to
legal experts that this case is a shaky one.

Two of the 8 defendants�political prisoners Herman Bell and Jalil
Muntaqim�are not eligible for bail. They remain in jail in San Francisco,
having already served more than 34 years in New York state prisons. This new
case charges them again with actions for which they are already doing time.

Learn more about the case and welcome home defendant Cisco Torres, released
on bail, now back with his family in Queens, New York.

Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 as we declare December 2007 to be VISA Month for the Cuban 5!! 

 
For the entire month of December, we are calling on people to fax or mail (international mailing rate applies) out this letter to Louise Arbour The High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. 
 

We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5s mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!! 
 
Due to the U.S. governments denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. 
 
The U.S. governments denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security. 
 
This Human Rights abuse must end NOW!! WE ASK THAT YOU FORWARD THIS LETTER/PDF AS FAR AND WIDE AS POSSIBLE!!  HEKLP THIS CAMPAIGN BE A POWERFUL ACTION OF SUPPORT FOR THE CUBAN 5!!

8-14 Avenue de la Paix
1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland 
Fax: + 41 22 917 9011 
 

To Louise Arbour: 
 

Since 1998, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Labaino, Antonio Guerrero, Fernando Gonzalez, and Rene Gonzalez, known as the Cuban 5, have been unjustly imprisoned in the United States for trying to prevent terrorist attacks against Cuba. Throughout their incarceration the Cuban 5 have been victims of multiple human rights violations. One of the most unjust and inhuman of these violations has been the systematic denial of visitation from their relatives; a basic right of all prisoners. 
 

The U.S. government has imposed a number of obstacles and unjustifiable delays in granting visas to their families. Hence, some of the Cuban 5 have only received an annual visit from family. In the cases of Gerardo Hernandez and Rene Gonzalez, the situation is far more critical, as their wives, Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva, have not been allowed to visit them in prison so far. The U.S. government asserts that these women are a risk to national security. The U.S. government has no proof or rationale that their presence will negatively impact national security. 
 

In order to bring to an end to this flagrant violation of human rights, I ask that you intercede in this matter and request that the U.S. government grant visas to the families of the Cuban 5 and allow them to see their relatives on a regular basis. 
 

Sincerely,

_______________________________________________________
 
Join The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 as we declare December 2007 to be VISA Month for the Cuban 5!! 

 For the entire month of December, we are calling on people to fax or mail (international mailing rate applies) out this letter to Louise Arbour The High Commissioner of Human Rights of the Office for Human Rights-United Nations Office at Geneva. 

 We are asking her to intercede on behalf of the Cuban 5s mothers/wives to pressure the U.S. government to grant them VISAs to visit their husbands/sons!! 

 Due to the U.S. governments denial to approve visas, Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert have not seen their wives since their incarceration!! Others in the Cuban 5 have not seen their parents, wives and children with regularity, because the U.S. government has taken prolonged periods of time to issue them visas. 

 The U.S. governments denial of visitation rights is a cruel and horrible form of psychological torture. Their rationale for denial is ridiculous and baseless; none of these family members are a threat to national security. 

 This Human Rights abuse must end NOW!! WE ASK THAT YOU FORWARD THIS EMAIL AS FAR AND WIDE AS POSSIBLE!!  

 HELP THIS CAMPAIGN BE A POWERFUL ACTION OF SUPPORT FOR THE CUBAN 5!!

The pdf is at http://www.jerichony.org/images18/Cuban5VISA.pdf

MANY THANKS TO THE JERICHO MOVEMENT FOR HOSTING OUR PDF ON THEIR WEBSITE!!

More than 100 Personalities from 27 Countries Launch an International Commission for the Right of Family Visits on Behalf of Family Members of the Cuban Five Held in U.S. Prisons

December 11, 2007

For Immediate Release                 Contact: Alicia Jrapko 510-219-0092

On top of the unjust sentences being served by the Five Cuban anti terrorists imprisoned in the United States, another punishment has been added to them and that is the denial of regular contact with their family members. During 2007 the US government has granted visas only to two of the family members of these five men. For 18 months these families have been waiting for word about when and if they can travel to visit their sons, fathers or husbands. 
 
The most extreme situation is that of the wives of Ren Gonzalez and Gerardo Hernandez.   Olga Salanueva and Adriana Prez respectively have not been allowed to visit them for 7 and 9 years. This past September 12th marked the 9th anniversary of the arrests of the Cuban Five and on that day the U.S. Government once again denied visas for Olga and Adriana to visit their husbands in prison. On 8 separate occasions they have applied for a visa and each time they have been denied for a different reason without real justification.
 
Because of this outrageous and mean spirited behavior of the Bush government concerning these women, the International Commission for the Right of Family Visits has been formed with the purpose of demanding the U.S. government immediately grant of visas for Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva.
 
The Commission will base its demand on the humanitarian right for families to visit their loved ones in prison based on The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention against Torture.  This Commission will take into consideration the opinion of the United Nation Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions of May 27, 2005, statements on behalf of Olga and Adriana from Amnesty International, as well as supporting statements from the European Parliament.
 
Personalities from around the world include Adolfo Perez Esquivel, Nobel Peace Prize from Argentina, Rigoberta Mench, Nobel Peace Prize from Guatemala, Danielle Mitterand, former First Lady of France, and many others. Here in the United States a number of personalities have agreed to be part of the International Commission including  Bishop of Detroit, Thomas Gumbleton, Angela Davis, UC Santa Cruz Professor, Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, Former General Secretary of the National Council of Churches,  actor Danny Glover, writer Alice Walker, linguist Noam Chomsky, historian Howard Zinn, former US Congressman Esteban Torres, Wayne Smith former Chief of the US Interests Section in Havana Cuba, and Michael Parenti, author and scholar. 
 
We demand the freedom of the Cuban Five and in the mean time we demand the respect of the basic right of their families to visit them. Denying prisoners the affection of their loved ones is another form of cruelty and torture. 
 
International Committee for the Freedom of the Cuban Five
