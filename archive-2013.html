Letter from Journalist Stephen Kimber to Barack Obama


Jan. 7, 2013 
Honorable Barack Obama
President of the United States of America
The White House
Washington DC 20500
Dear President Obama, 



Stephen Kimber 
This is my first ever letter to an American 
president. That‚Äôs not just because I‚Äôm not an American citizen. I‚Äôm also a journalist, and journalists are not in the habit of writing letters 
to heads of governments.

But having spent the past three years researching the case of the Cuban Five, I believe I have an obligation to write to you.

The fact is American journalism hasn‚Äôt done a 
very good job of explaining to the American public the case of the five 
Cuban intelligence agents who have been incarcerated in the U.S. since 
1998. As a result, your administration has mostly managed to avoid 
dealing with the issue at all or, when forced to comment, responding 
with the tired, rote rhetoric of the Cold War era.

 
But the case of the Cuban Five has recently been brought back 
into the public spotlight because of Alan Gross, the USAID subcontractor currently serving a 15-year jail term in Cuba for bringing satellite 
communication equipment into that country.

The media reporting of his case has been 
equally problematic, mostly parroting your own State Department line 
that Gross is a ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù who was arrested while trying to help 
Havana‚Äôs tiny Jewish community communicate with the outside world, and 
is now being held ‚Äúhostage‚Äù by Havana.
You know that‚Äôs not true. So, of course, 
should the media. After all, it was Desmond Butler, a foreign affairs 
reporter for the Associated Press‚Äîa news agency subscribed to by most 
American media and unlikely ever to be mistaken for a tool of the Cuban 
regime‚Äîwho documented the facts of the case.
Alan Gross was ‚Äúpaid a half-million dollars‚Äù 
by USAID, your government‚Äôs ‚Äúdemocracy promoting‚Äù agency, to smuggle 
sophisticated communications equipment into Cuba. That technology 
included Internet satellite phones capable of avoiding detection and 
spy-quality SIM cards ‚Äúmost frequently‚Äù used by the Defense Department 
and the CIA.

The goal of all of this was not to assist 
Cuba‚Äôs Jewish community communicate, as your government has insisted 
(the Jewish community already had Internet connectivity) but to promote 
regime change‚Äîto overthrow the government of Cuba.

Gross‚Äôs own reports make clear he knew he was 
engaged in ‚Äúvery risky business‚Äù and that discovery of what he was up to ‚Äúwill be catastrophic.‚Äù
That said, Alan Gross‚Äôs family and friends, not surprisingly, want him freed.

Just as the Cubans want the Five‚Äîwho are considered national heroes in their homeland‚Äîfreed.

Your government‚Äôs unblinking response has been that there is simply ‚Äúno equivalence.‚Äù The Cubans were trained 
intelligence agents convicted of trying to steal military secrets and 
conspiracy to murder four innocent civilians killed in the shootdown of 
two unarmed Brothers to the Rescue aircraft in 1996. By contrast, the 
American argument goes, Alan Gross was just a humanitarian do-gooder.

We now know Alan Gross was much more than that.

But it is equally true the Cuban Five are much less than the murderous danger to American security the media and your 
government has portrayed.

I have read the 20,000-plus pages of the 
transcript of their trial and examined the thousands of additional pages of documents prosecutors entered into evidence to try to convict them.
I won‚Äôt try to whitewash the case against 
them. They were trained intelligence agents, and some of them used false identities to enter the United States. Part of the mission of some of 
them was to gather military information.

Their primary military mission, however, was 
not to look for information that could be used to attack the United 
States (forgetting, for the moment, the ludicrousness of the idea of 
tiny Cuba launching a military attack against the might U.S.).

The Cuban Five posed no military or security 
threat to the United States. Don‚Äôt believe me. Ask retired U.S. 
Lieutenant General James R. Clapper, your own Director of National 
Intelligence. When you appointed him in 2010, you said he possessed ‚Äúa 
quality that I value in all my advisers: a willingness to tell leaders 
what we need to know even if it‚Äôs not what we want to hear.‚Äù

You should hear then what General Clapper had 
to say about the Cuban Five. In 2001, as Director of the National 
Geospatial Intelligence Agency, Clapper testified at the trial of the 
Five. He was asked specifically whether he would, ‚Äúwith your experience 
in intelligence matters, describe Cuba as a military threat to the 
United States?‚Äù His answer: ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. Cuba does not represent a 
threat.‚Äù He also testified he found no evidence to suggest members of 
the Five were ‚Äútrying to obtain secret information.‚Äù

The real military goal of the Five was to 
protect Cuba from possible American attack. That such an attack was 
possible is beyond dispute. Consider‚Äîas the Cubans undoubtedly 
did‚ÄîGrenada (1983), Panama (1989) and Haiti (1994).

Cuba‚Äôs unarmed agents were essentially 
canaries in a foreign coal mine, using their trained eyes and ears to 
detect signals of possible imminent attack. When you think about it, 
that‚Äôs exactly what your American satellites, drones and, yes, human 
agents do in countries where you perceive a threat to American security 
from hostile governments‚Äîor terrorist elements.

That, in fact, was the real purpose behind 
Cuba sending its agents to Florida‚Äîto infiltrate and report back on the 
activities of terrorist anti-Castro exile groups who were actively 
plotting and often carrying out deadly attacks against Cuba from the 
safe sanctuary of Florida.

I don‚Äôt need to tell you that such attacks are illegal under the U.S. Neutrality Act, but perhaps it is worth 
reminding you that American authorities have rarely arrested anyone in 
connection with such plots and that Florida juries have even more rarely convicted anyone accused of any crime against Cuba.
I‚Äôll come back to that.

Perhaps the most significant‚Äîand seemingly 
rational‚Äîrationale your government has offered for refusing to consider a humanitarian swap of the Five for Alan Gross is the reality that one of the Five was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in connection 
with the shootdown of those Brothers to the Rescue planes in 1996.

One can argue‚ÄîI do‚Äîthat the Cuban government 
should not have authorized its jets to shoot down those aircraft. 
Despite the Brothers‚Äô well documented ongoing provocations and illegal 
violations of Cuban airspace‚Äîwhich, by the way, both the FAA and the 
Clinton administration considered illegal and provocative, and attempted to stop‚ÄîI continue to believe there were other, better options for the 
Cuban government than bringing down the planes.
But that is beside the point.

The only important issue here is whether any 
of those five agents had any control over, or played any role in the 
decision to shoot the planes down. Having read the trial transcript and 
examined the evidence presented during their trial, my conclusion is not only that there is no compelling link between any of the Five and the 
shootdown but that, in fact, the evidence leads to the opposite 
conclusion.

Cuban State Security is incredibly 
compartmentalized and information about such a significant attack would 
have only been communicated on a need-to-know basis. There was no need 
for low-level Florida field agents to know anything about what Havana‚Äôs 
military was actually planning, and there is no evidence they did.
But, you may counter, the Five were convicted by a Miami jury who heard all the evidence.

Let‚Äôs consider that.

I don‚Äôt have to tell you about the pervasive 
power and influence in Miami of right-wing Cuban exile groups. After two presidential campaigns, you know that better than anyone.
But let‚Äôs consider three other points when we 
imagine the chances that a Miami jury could impartially judge the 
actions of acknowledged Cuban agents.

In the lead-up to the trial of the Five‚Äîwhich 
took place in the aftermath of the emotionally charged Elian Gonz√°lez 
affair‚ÄîMiami‚Äôs media was filled to bursting with even 
more-frenzied-than-usual anti-Cuban rhetoric. We now know that at least 
some of that was orchestrated by journalists who were also being 
secretly paid by the U.S. Government‚Äôs own Broadcasting Board of 
Governors. When those clandestine payments were first revealed in 2006, 
the Miami Herald‚Äîto its credit‚Äîfired its bought-and-paid-for 
journalists for their egregious violations of journalistic ethics. But 
by then the damage had been done. [Read more about this issue on this website]

Consider as well the double standard of 
justice that was common in cases involving Cuba. There was another 
criminal case that took place around the same time as the arrest of the 
Cuban Five. The FBI had charged a group of anti-Castro Miami exiles, who had been arrested aboard a vessel off Puerto Rico, with plotting to 
assassinate Fidel Castro. Defense lawyers tried to get the trial moved 
to Miami. Federal prosecutors objected on the grounds that their case 
against the men would not get a fair hearing from a jury in Miami. Less 
than a year later, however, federal prosecutors objected again when the 
Five‚Äôs defense lawyers applied to have the trial moved out of Miami. Did they really believe Miami juries they‚Äôd claimed were too sympathetic to anti-Cuban exiles would suddenly be able to fairly adjudicate a case 
involving pro-Cuban agents?

Even more to the point, prosecutors in the 
Cuban Five case‚Äîjust before the jury was to begin its deliberations‚Äî 
asked an appeal court to allow them to drop the charge of conspiracy to 
commit murder because they didn‚Äôt believe the evidence they‚Äôd presented 
could lead to a conviction.

Although the appeal court rejected their plea, the prosecutors needn‚Äôt have worried. After a seven-month trial, the 
Miami jury took just a few days to find the Five guilty on all counts, 
including conspiracy to commit murder.

I‚Äôd simply ask you to instruct your own 
lawyers to review the trial transcript and examine the evidence linking 
the Five to the shootdown‚Äîand report back to you on what they find.
It may be sobering.

You already know that Amnesty International 
has raised ‚Äúdoubts about the fairness and impartiality of the trial [of 
the Five]‚Ä¶ the strength of the evidence to support the conspiracy to 
murder conviction‚Ä¶ and whether the circumstances of the pre-trial 
detention of the five men, in which they had limited access to their 
attorneys and to documents, may have undermined their right to defense.‚Äù

You will know as well that the United Nations‚Äô Human Rights Commission‚Äôs Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions, after 
examining the evidence, ‚Äúrequested the U.S. government to adopt the 
necessary steps to remedy the situation.‚Äù

You may point out‚Äîrightly‚Äîthat the United 
Nations Working Group more recently determined that Alan Gross‚Äôs 
detention was also ‚Äúarbitrary,‚Äù that the Cuban court did not act in an 
‚Äúindependent and impartial manner‚Äù and called on Havana to ‚Äúorder 
[Gross‚Äôs] immediate release.‚Äù

Even if we accept the findings of the UN report, where does it leave us? Can two wrongs make a right?

The reality is that neither Alan Gross nor the Cuban Five should be languishing in prison. They are all, in the end, 
victims of the failed 50-plus-year history of American policy toward 
Cuba.

It is time to end the injustice‚Äîand, frankly, 
the stupidity‚Äîof a policy that hasn‚Äôt, and doesn‚Äôt serve the interest of either country. Or the world.

As you gear up for your inauguration and the 
unique opportunity a second-term American president has to create an 
historic legacy, I would urge you to reconsider the case of the Cuban 
Five.

You should use the occasion to grant executive clemency for the Five, allowing them to return home to Cuba. The Cubans have already indicated they would be prepared to reciprocate by freeing Alan Gross to return to his family in the United States.

Such a swap would not only represent a 
significant and long overdue humanitarian gesture by both governments 
but it would also signal an opportunity to finally restart relations 
between the United States and Havana on the basis of mutual respect and 
understanding.

Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Stephen Kimber

Subject:En Cubadebate: Se les acaba el tiempo a los due√±os de lo	s relojes<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre>Se les acaba el tiempo a los dueÒos de los relojes

Por Pedro Gonz·lez MunnÈ *

 

  Hoy en dÌa, cuando en todas partes se cuestiona el mejor lugar para
disfrutar de la visa para un sueÒo, sigo creyendo que Èste no lo es y aunque
los cubanos seguimos llegando, tal vez por aquello de los beneficios del
ajuste, privilegio negado a los negritos de HaitÌ o los indios de
LatinoamÈrica, como tan mal vociferan estos exiliados racistas que nos
gastamos en la calle Ocho y sus emisoras.

  Sin embargo, estos mismos exiliados, ratas del imperio desde que arribaron
a esta ciÈnaga en los 60, ahora se revuelven contra su propia sangre y
califican, al Ajuste Cubano de Ley: ìanacrÛnica e injustaî. 

  øPor quÈ? Pues porque el exilio se diluye, sus pretextos de ser emigrados
polÌticos se acaban y se esfuman las subvenciones de decenas de millones de
dÛlares del dinero de los contribuyentes a sus organizaciones de cuatro
gatos, destinadas a payolas a periodistas, polÌticos y pagar programas de
radio, p·ginas internet e interminables diatribas de octogenarios hÈroes de
la estampida.

  Nunca, hasta hoy, se acordaron del privilegio de esa Ley al inmigrante
cubano, con residencia legal en Estados Unidos y beneficios desde pagos de
seguro social hasta sellos de alimentos, con la posibilidad de hacerse
ciudadanos a los cinco aÒos, lo cual no podÌan obtener otras comunidades de
honestas familias, como los nicarag¸enses, los venezolanos, mexicanos o
centroamericanos -los indios de marras- o los negritos haitianos.

  Su griterÌa se basa, esta vez, en la diferencia con los cubanos nuevos,
emigrados de las oleadas a partir de los aÒos 80, los cuales tan pronto
legalizan su situaciÛn viajan de vuelta a la isla a visitar a sus seres
queridos -si el Gobierno cubano les permite la entrada-, lo cual, es su
derecho seg˙n la constituciÛn norteamericana, al ser residentes legales, o
ciudadanos.

  Luego de muchos aÒos de ser los preferidos del imperio, los exiliados
pierden el lustre de auto declararse titanes de la estampida y tambiÈn, lo
que m·s les duele en el ocaso de sus vidas, va raleando la payola.

  La realidad duele y tambiÈn el hecho de la osadÌa del cubano en favor de
su RevoluciÛn, lo cual no demuestran como dÛciles seguidores del palo y la
zanahoria -ejemplos frecuentes sobran en Miami-, sino de constructores
afanados por un sistema social donde la educaciÛn, la salud y la protecciÛn
son derechos y no promesas de polÌticos, todo a pesar de la constante
amenaza real y un genocida embargo del mayor imperio del mundo.

  Por la otra parte, no existe justificaciÛn para el control de una
burocracia obsoleta y absurda sobre los destinos de un pueblo, o del
mantenimiento de figuras -con su justo pedestal en la historia-, pero hoy
muestra de atraso y resabio, demostrando en su abstrusa contenciÛn a lo
nuevo, todo lo contrario de la imagen proyectada por sus acciones pasadas.

  Los extremos se tocan y a la vez como cambian las fronteras polÌticas de
uno y otro lado, la apologÌa del inmovilismo, la loa ilustrada por la
prebenda y el ocio impuesto al productor, nos convocan al desastre, abonado
por aquellos ecos de una estampida cobarde, solidarios contra el pueblo, a
los ejemplos de fatiga de quienes fueran, o nunca fueron, los
revolucionarios que hoy necesita la Patria.

  El imperio no osa invadir a Cuba, no por aquello de tecnologÌas y
prepotencias en demasÌa, sino porque la estrategia debe contar con la
respuesta del tsunami internacional de apoyo a la RevoluciÛn cubana y del
combate viril de un pueblo constructor de esa sociedad, ni con mucho
perfecta o acabada, pero sÌ la base de las esperanzas, esfuerzos e ideales
de todos los cubanos, donde quiera que estemos.

  Es hora de enfocar los caÒones a los verdaderos enemigos, de adentro y de
afuera, del concierto unido con la convocatoria de todos los cubanos
desperdigados por el mundo y sobre todo, de escuchar el alerta del poeta que
con su verbo, su pluma y su sangre forjÛ el acero de una RevoluciÛn
aplazada: levantemos al fin una NaciÛn con Todos y por el bien de todos.

PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER NORBERTO GONZALEZ CLAUDIODENIED MEDICAL ATTENTION!
 
¬†
The Committee to Support Avelino and Norberto Gonz√°lez Claudio, The
Caribbean and Latin American Coordinating Committee of Puerto Rico, The Human
Rights Committee of Puerto Rico, The Resistance Collective, The Socialist
Front, The New School, The Movement for Socialism, The National Hostosiano
Independence Movment, The Socialist Movement of Workers, The Puerto Rican
Independence Party of Puerto Rico,¬† The
Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, and The Revolutionary Party of Puerto Rican
Workers-Macheteros, and The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign in New York Cityannounce that during the opening of the
Festival for Claridad Newspaper in Puerto Rico, they will launch a campaign to
denounce the inhuman treatment that political prisoner Norberto Gonz√°lez
Claudio is currently receiving and to demand that he receive urgently needed
medical attention.¬† The aforementioned
organizations will request that the House and Senate of Puerto Rico approve the
concurrent Resolution 500, that has been presented by Senator Mar√≠a de Lourdes
Santiago in the legislature.
¬†
Norberto Gonz√°lez Claudio was arrested May 10, 2011, for an
expropriation that was carried out by the Macheteros (Machete Wielders) in 1983
in Harford, Connecticut, as part of the struggle for the Independence of Puerto
Rico.¬† At the time of his arrest
Norberto was in an excellent state of health and was wearing an orthopedic
show.¬† In the course of his detention it
was ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù that Norberto had a lesion in his leg that a biopsy
established was cancerous.
¬†
His orthopedic shoe was taken away, they refused to provide him with
one and they have prevented his family from providing him with another
one.¬† The little medical attention to
treat the cancerous lesion has been limited and deficient and it has also been
revealed that he has not received any treatment for yet another lesion that is
potentially cancerous.
¬†
At present, Norberto is in the process of being transferred to an
institution where he will complete his sentence.¬† It has been the custom of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to submit
it‚Äôs Puerto Rican political prisoners to lengthy and discriminatory processes
of transfer during which they are sent from prison to prison for long periods
of time.¬† 
¬†
In this process they are kept incommunicado from their families, their
lawyers and they are denied the most minimum medical attention and the
medications that they have been prescribed.¬†¬† We recall the treatment that Avelino Gonz√°lez Claudio, Norbertos‚Äô
brother and comrade in struggle, who was also arrested in excellent health and
was released suffering from Parkinsons Disease, was denied medications,
suffering from a possible tumor in his back -- that they refused to treat.
¬†
The absence of medical evaluation and treatment for cancerous lesions
and the denial of an orthopedic shoe, clearly place the life of Norberto
Gonz√°lez Claudio in danger.
¬†
We hereby denounce these flagrant violations of the human rights of
this patriot and announce the commencement of a petition campaign to bring a
halt to this abuse.

United Nations High
Commissioner for Human RightsNavenethem Pillay has met with Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva, two of the wives ofthe Cuban 5, and has stated that she willintercede on their behalf. 

Mail or Fax Ms. Pillay the Project's Letter and hold her accountable to her public statement of support.† 
Remind her that the U.S. community supports the Cuban 5 and their wives' visitation rights.




U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for
the case of the Cuban Five 
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, yesterday,
Olga Salanueva, spouse of RenÈ Gonz·lez, and Adriana PÈrez, spouse of Gerardo
Hern·ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and Olga explained to the High
Commissioner the necessity that this organization intercedes in a direct manner
on behalf of the case of the Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while they
requested their support in order to be granted visas to entry the United States
to visit their husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime endured by
Rene constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with any purpose and
unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and reunite his relatives.
Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that requires the political
willingness and ethics of the United States Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a violation to
the human rights and expressed this cannot constitute an additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to this fight and her
intention to do whatever is possible to find a solution to the case.

*The American Indian Quarterly* 24.3 (2000) 400-419

A young Indian woman entered Dr. Connie Pinkerton-Uri's Los Angeles office
on a November day in 1972. The twenty-six-year-old woman asked Dr.
Pinkerton-Uri for a "womb transplant" because she and her husband wished to
start a family. An Indian Health Service (IHS) physician had given the
woman a complete hysterectomy when she was having problems with alcoholism
six years earlier. Dr. Pinkerton-Uri had to tell the young woman that there
was no such thing as a "womb transplant" despite the IHS physician having
told her that the surgery was reversible. The woman left Dr.
Pinkerton-Uri's office in tears.

Two young women entered an IHS hospital in Montana to undergo
appendectomies and received tubal ligations, a form of sterilization, as an
added benefit. Bertha Medicine Bull, a member of the Northern Cheyenne
tribe, related how the "two girls had been sterilized at age fifteen before
they had any children. Both were having appendectomies when the doctors
sterilized them without their knowledge or consent." Their parents were not
informed either. Two fifteen-year-old girls would never be able to have
children of their own.

What happened to these three females was a common occurrence during the
1960s and 1970s. Native Americans accused the Indian Health Service of
sterilizing at least 25 percent of Native American women who were between
the ages of fifteen and forty-four during the 1970s. The allegations
included: failure to provide women with necessary information regarding
sterilization; use of coercion to get signatures on the consent forms;
improper consent forms; and lack of an appropriate waiting period (at least
seventy-two hours) between the signing of a consent form and the surgical
procedure. This paper investigates the historical relationship between the
IHS and Indian tribes; the right of the United States government to
sterilize women; the government regulations pertaining to sterilization;
the efforts of theIHS to sterilize American Indian women; physicians'
reasons for sterilizing American Indian women; and the consequences the
sterilizations had on the lives of a few of those women and their families.*
*

The IHS evolved out of various government programs designed to address the
health care issues of American Indians. Under the auspices of the War
Department in the early 1800s, "Army physicians took steps to curb smallpox
and other contagious diseases of Indian Tribes living in the vicinity of
military posts." Army physicians used vaccinations and other medical
procedures to prevent both military men and the Indians they came in
contact with from being infected with diseases. The first treaty that
included medical services was signed between the United States and the
Winnebago Indians in 1832. In 1832 Congress provided funding for Indian
health care in the amount of twelve thousand dollars.

In 1849 Congress transferred the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) from the
War Department to the Department of the Interior, including all health care
responsibilities for American Indians. By 1875 half of the federal Indian
agencies had physicians, and the BIA built the first federal hospital for
Indians in Oklahoma during the late 1880s. After the turn of the century,
the BIA created a separate health division and appointed district medical
directors. The health division started special programs to combat
tuberculosis and other diseases and established health education classes to
support these programs. The Snyder Act of 1921 included congressional
authorization for the BIAto provide Indian health care "for the benefit,
care, and assistance of the Indians throughout the United States." The
BIA contracted
with the Public Health Service (PHS) in 1928 to provide sanitation
engineers to investigate water and sewage problems at BIA facilities and
renewed and expanded that contract through the early 1950s.

In 1955 Congress transferred total responsibility for Indian health from
the Department of the Interior to the Public Health Service. The...

PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER NORBERTO GONZALEZ CLAUDIODENIED MEDICAL ATTENTION! HE HAS CANCER IS NOT BEING TREATED FOR IT!

For immediate distribution


PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER NORBERTO GONZALEZ CLAUDIODENIED MEDICAL ATTENTION!
 
†
The Committee to Support Avelino and Norberto Gonz·lez Claudio, The
Caribbean and Latin American Coordinating Committee of Puerto Rico, The Human
Rights Committee of Puerto Rico, The Resistance Collective, The Socialist
Front, The New School, The Movement for Socialism, The National Hostosiano
Independence Movment, The Socialist Movement of Workers, The Puerto Rican
Independence Party of Puerto Rico,† The
Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, and The Revolutionary Party of Puerto Rican
Workers-Macheteros, and The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign in New York Cityannounce that during the opening of the
Festival for Claridad Newspaper in Puerto Rico, they will launch a campaign to
denounce the inhuman treatment that political prisoner Norberto Gonz·lez
Claudio is currently receiving and to demand that he receive urgently needed
medical attention.† The aforementioned
organizations will request that the House and Senate of Puerto Rico approve the
concurrent Resolution 500, that has been presented by Senator MarÌa de Lourdes
Santiago in the legislature.
†
Norberto Gonz·lez Claudio was arrested May 10, 2011, for an
expropriation that was carried out by the Macheteros (Machete Wielders) in 1983
in Harford, Connecticut, as part of the struggle for the Independence of Puerto
Rico.† At the time of his arrest
Norberto was in an excellent state of health and was wearing an orthopedic
show.† In the course of his detention it
was "discovered" that Norberto had a lesion in his leg that a biopsy
established was cancerous.
†
His orthopedic shoe was taken away, they refused to provide him with
one and they have prevented his family from providing him with another
one.† The little medical attention to
treat the cancerous lesion has been limited and deficient and it has also been
revealed that he has not received any treatment for yet another lesion that is
potentially cancerous.
†
At present, Norberto is in the process of being transferred to an
institution where he will complete his sentence.† It has been the custom of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to submit
it's Puerto Rican political prisoners to lengthy and discriminatory processes
of transfer during which they are sent from prison to prison for long periods
of time.† 
†
In this process they are kept incommunicado from their families, their
lawyers and they are denied the most minimum medical attention and the
medications that they have been prescribed.†† We recall the treatment that Avelino Gonz·lez Claudio, Norbertos'
brother and comrade in struggle, who was also arrested in excellent health and
was released suffering from Parkinsons Disease, was denied medications,
suffering from a possible tumor in his back -- that they refused to treat.
†
The absence of medical evaluation and treatment for cancerous lesions
and the denial of an orthopedic shoe, clearly place the life of Norberto
Gonz·lez Claudio in danger.
†
We hereby denounce these flagrant violations of the human rights of
this patriot and announce the commencement of a petition campaign to bring a
halt to this abuse.

Fuera la Marina de Vieques.



Hi again Scott, bellow you will find a lot of Information about the fight
for the lives of the People of Vieques. This Puerto Rican Island's
environment needs a lot of solidarity and other kinds of help. A lot of
crimes against nature have been committed against this Island in the name
of "National Security" at the expense of the security and health of
its People and the national security of Puerto Rico.   The cancer rate in
vieques is today 27% higher than in the main Island. Depleted uranium and
other heavy metals contaminate Vieques Today the Navy is exploding bombs
that did not explode for over 70 years.

 A lot of bombs with all kinds of heavy metals exploded there for all those
years. Puerto Rico first encountered this before Iraq or Palestine.

This is a consequense of colonialism and foreign domination of our
Father Land(Patrie in Latin) But we prefer Patria because for us the land
is female. In fact the Mother land for many of us is wrapped in an
emotional, mystical and sacred meaning. After all Puerto Rico is our Mother
and its hard to see her disrespected and violated before our very own eyes.
So we make efforts to liberate her from the assassin that threatens her
very life.

Don Hector Lopez

Rose Clemente Supports Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Norberto Gonzalez Claudio!
†

Rosa Alicia Clemente is a Black Puerto Rican grassroots organizer, hip-hop activist, journalist, and entrepreneur.
Founder of Know Thy Self Productions, Rosa has created two successful college/universities tours, Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win and the Speak Truth to Power.

With an earned degree from the University of Albany and a Masters of Professional Studies from Cornell 
University she is committed to scholar-activism and youth organizing. 


As an activist she has traveled domestically and internationally to colleges, universities, high schools and prisons.
†
Rosa's Statement of Support:

In 2008 I was proud to be 
nominated by the Green Party as the first Puerto Rican/Boricua 
Vice-Presidential† Candidate to be on the ballot in a 
presidential election. One of the main reasons I joined this political 
party is that the Green Party Platform includes the immediate 
release of all Political Prisoners, Prisoners of War and the immediate 
de-colonization of La Isla. 


Not only must we stand up 
and challenge Norberto's wrongful incarceration, but the denial of 
treatment for his cancer as well as the removal of his 
orthopedic shoe, which is inhumane and shows the lengths the U.S. 
government will go to silence our freedom fighters. I am proud to stand with ProLibertad, Norberto's wife Elda and the many 
groups that are demanding that Norberto be given medical 
attention now! As he heals, we all must continue the fight to FREE 'EM 
ALL! Palante, Siempre, Palante.

SEND A LETTER TO THE BUREAU OF PRISONS DEMANDING NORBERTO RECEIVE THE MEDICAL ATTENTION HE DESERVES.

RenÈ Gonz·lez' father has died!

C·ndido RenÈ Gonz·lez, the father of one of the Five Cuban antiterrorists condemned to long sentences in the U.S., died 
today in Havana at age 82. The national television news reported that 
Gonzalez expired due to a stroke, after a severe and protracted illness.


His body was cremated on Monday morning and 
the ashes will be deposited in  a mausoleum  at Havana's ColÛn Cemetery 
during a private family ceremony.


The note states that C·ndido Gonz·lez 
emigrated to America in 1950 and joined the July 26 Movement in Chicago 
and was a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.


He returned home in 1961, when he joined the 
National Revolutionary Militia and mobilized and in antiaircraft 
artillery units during the October Crisis.


He was also a cane cutter for 10   harvest seasons and a trade union leader.


His son, RenÈ Gonz·lez, is forced to remain in the United States under the parole system, despite having finished his 
sentence  for preventing terrorist attacks on his country in 2011.


Other prosecuted for a similar reason were 
Gerardo Hern·ndez, RamÛn LabaÒino, Antonio Guerrero and Fernando 
Gonzalez, whose release have been demanded by millions of people 
worldwide.

RenÈ Gonz·lez' father has died!

C·ndido RenÈ Gonz·lez, the father of one of the Five Cuban antiterrorists
condemned to long sentences in the U.S., died 
today in Havana at age 82. The national television news reported that 
Gonzalez expired due to a stroke, after a severe and protracted illness.

His body was cremated on Monday morning and 
the ashes will be deposited in a mausoleum at Havana's ColÛn Cemetery 
during a private family ceremony.

The note states that C·ndido Gonz·lez 
emigrated to America in 1950 and joined the July 26 Movement in Chicago 
and was a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

He returned home in 1961, when he joined the 
National Revolutionary Militia and mobilized and in antiaircraft 
artillery units during the October Crisis.

He was also a cane cutter for 10 harvest seasons and a trade union leader.

His son, RenÈ Gonz·lez, is forced to remain in the United States under the
parole system, despite having finished his 
sentence for preventing terrorist attacks on his country in 2011.

Other prosecuted for a similar reason were 
Gerardo Hern·ndez, RamÛn LabaÒino, Antonio Guerrero and Fernando 
Gonzalez, whose release have been demanded by millions of people 
worldwide.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for the case of the Cuban Five
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, 
yesterday, Olga Salanueva, spouse of RenÈ Gonz·lez, and Adriana PÈrez, 
spouse of Gerardo Hern·ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and Olga explained to the High Commissioner the necessity that this organization intercedes in a direct manner on 
behalf of the case of the Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while 
they requested their support in order to be granted visas to entry the 
United States to visit their husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime endured by Rene 
constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with any purpose and 
unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and reunite his 
relatives. Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that requires the 
political willingness and ethics of the United States Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a violation to the human 
rights and expressed this cannot constitute an additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to this fight and her intention 
to do whatever is possible to find a solution to the case.

Ramona Africa and the MOVE Organization Support Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Norberto GonzalezClaudio!

  


The MOVE Organization is a family of strong, serious, deeply committed 
revolutionaries founded by a wise, perceptive, strategically minded 
Black man named JOHN AFRICA.  The principle of our belief is explained in a collection of writings we call "The Guidelines," authored by JOHN AFRICA.  To honor our beloved Founder, and acknowledge the wisdom and strength He has given us, we say "LONG LIVE JOHN AFRICA!"¬†¬† MOVE works for the freedom of the MOVE 9 political prisoners and Mumia Abu Jamal.

MOVE's Statement of Support:

ONA
MOVE!¬† LONG LIVE REVOLUTION AND LONG
LIVE JOHN AFRICA!!!

 
The MOVE Organization wants to express our revolutionary solidarity
with Norberto Gonzalez Claudio, a Puerto Rican warrior and revolutionary who
dares to take a strong righteous stand,not simply for his homeland but fundamentally for righteousness.¬† JOHN AFRICA, MOVE‚Äôs founder, has explained
that you not only have the right but that you are obligated to stand up, to
fight against oppression, injustice and freedom, uncompromisingly.¬† It is clear to MOVE that this monstrosity
called the united states have raped, robbed, murdered and generally wreaked
havoc all over the earth, on every species of life in existence,so nobody can convince us to call anybody a criminal because they
fight against this kind of racist, arrogant, vicious mentality.¬† How dare the united states act as though
they have the right to dominate Puerto Rico? There is no basis to such a
position, only the hallucination of superiority.¬† I applaud freedom fighters like Pedro Albizu Campos, Rafael
Cancel Miranda, Lolita Lebron and Norberto Gonzalez Claudio.¬† Oppression is devilish, evil,but the instinct to resist oppression is natural.¬† So long as oppression, restrained violation
exist,the instinct to revolt against it will
exist.¬† 


LONG LIVE NORBERTO GONZALEZ
CLAUDIO, LONG LIVE THE SPIRIT OF RESISTANCE AND LONG LIVE REVOLUTION!!!
ONA MOVE, LONG LIVE JOHN AFRICA
RAMONA AFRICA FOR THE MOVE

Rosa Clemente Supports Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Norberto Gonzalez Claudio!
¬†

Rosa Alicia Clemente is a Black Puerto Rican grassroots organizer, hip-hop activist, journalist, and entrepreneur.
Founder of Know Thy Self Productions, Rosa has created two successful college/universities tours, Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win and the Speak Truth to Power.

With an earned degree from the University of Albany and a Masters of Professional Studies from Cornell 
University she is committed to scholar-activism and youth organizing. 


As an activist she has traveled domestically and internationally to colleges, universities, high schools and prisons.
¬†
Rosa's Statement of Support:

In 2008 I was proud to be 
nominated by the Green Party as the first Puerto Rican/Boricua 
Vice-Presidential¬† Candidate to be on the ballot in a 
presidential election. One of the main reasons I joined this political 
party is that the Green Party Platform includes the immediate 
release of all Political Prisoners, Prisoners of War and the immediate 
de-colonization of La Isla. 


Not only must we stand up 
and challenge Norberto's wrongful incarceration, but the denial of 
treatment for his cancer as well as the removal of his 
orthopedic shoe, which is inhumane and shows the lengths the U.S. 
government will go to silence our freedom fighters. I am proud to stand with ProLibertad, Norberto's wife Elda and the many 
groups that are demanding that Norberto be given medical 
attention now! As he heals, we all must continue the fight to FREE 'EM 
ALL! Palante, Siempre, Palante.

SEND A LETTER TO THE BUREAU OF PRISONS DEMANDING NORBERTO RECEIVE THE MEDICAL ATTENTION HE DESERVES.

<pre>APRIL 11 A NATIONAL DAY OF ACTION TO SUPPORT THE BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION†

No U.S. Intervention in Venezuela Elections†

TELL WASHINGTON &amp; THE VENEZUELAN ELITE: NO TO DESTABILIZATION EFFORTS IN VENEZUELA,†

A day of Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution: Thursday APRIL 11, 2013†
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Washington DC, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Denver, Toronto, Vancouver, Olympia.
After the tragic death of our beloved president Chavez, the imperialist nations of the world are preparing to attack the Bolivarian Revolution. Venezuela is getting prepared for a new presidential election and the imperialists are intent to intervene and sabotage the election.†

President Nicolas Maduro has claimed that elements of the U.S. State Department are hiring mercenaries to attack Venezuela in the days of the presidential election. The United States wants to create chaos in Venezuela to justify a military intervention. Let them know that we are here to denounce them.†

NO US INTERVENTION IN VENEZUELA ELECTION†

The solidarity movement in the United States right now faces a critical challenge with regards to Venezuela as well as the revolutionary process in Latin America. The tragic death of our comrade President Hugo Chavez has many believing that the important process for progress in Venezuela, Latin America and the world, has been dealt a crippling blow but we know that the Venezuelan people and the region will never go backward. And our solidarity will continue as they move forward in their struggles for self-determination, sovereignty, integration and social justice.†

The people of Venezuela will honor the last will of President Chavez by overwhelmingly voting this coming April 14 for Nicolas Maduro for President. The Venezuelan people clearly remain committed to the process of fundamental change in their country, no matter what. We are confident that the roots of the Bolivarian Revolution will remain strong and grow.†

But the death of our dear President Hugo Chavez will be used by US imperialism and the elite oligarchy in Venezuela to carry out aggressive plans to destabilize the revolutionary process in Venezuela. We must send a strong message to Washington right away: we are organizing our voices of solidarity with the Venezuelan people and demand no intervention during this coming election in Venezuela.†

Why April 11? The Venezuelan coup attempt of 2002 was a failed coup d'Ètat on 11 April 2002, that saw late President Hugo Chavez ousted from office for 47 hours, being restored by a combination of military loyalists and massive public support for his government. Chavez was initially detained by members of the military and of pro-business elites represented by Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce (Fedec·maras) president Pedro Carmona, who was declared as the interim president. Carmona's brief rule saw the Venezuelan National Assembly and the Supreme Court both dissolved, and the country's 1999 Constitution declared void.†

In New York City, we will gather at Times Square between 41 &amp; 42 ST and 7 Avenue @ 4PM to express our love and solidarity with the legacy of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and then we will march to the U.S. Mission to tell President Barack Obama: We do not want U.S. intervention in Venezuela.†

If you are in a city where no action is taking place, call, fax, email the White House and voice your opposition to intervention. Or better yet, organize a local action!†

Please contact us and let us know how your organization can support this national day for the Bolivarian Revolution. cbalbertolovera@†gmail.com,†718-510-5523†or†347-251-6301or†646-533-6081.†

Room: W610, DATE/Time: Saturday, 8th of June 5:30pm-7:10pm
(take #6, 5 or 4 train to Brooklyn Bridge and walk behind City Hall)

Abstract: Puerto Rican Political Prisoner Oscar Lopez Rivera, now 70 years old, has been incarcerated for 32 years in US prisons for struggling to free Puerto Rico from US 114 years of colonial domination. He was charged with "seditious conspiracy" and handed a 70 year prison sentence. Oscar has recently published his book entitled "Between Torture and Resistance". This panel will discuss the legal aspects of the case, the international work, and the broad campaign "New York Coordinator to Free Oscar",  launched for his release at a local, national and international level. We will hear from international law lawyer, former political prisoners, videos of Nobel Peace Prize winners like of Archbishop Desmund Tutu's support for his release and campaign supporters. All we need from President Obama is to grant Oscar Lopez Rivera clemency (pardon).

SUPPORT FOR PUERTO RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER NORBERTO GONZALEZ CLAUDIO'S INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CAMPAIGN CONTINUES TO GROW!




International Human Rights Activist, Former United States Attorney General, and Founder of the International Action Center Ramsey Clark endorses Norberto's Medical Campaign!

This esteemed list of endorsersincludes:
Former Vice Presidential Candidate Rosa Clemente
Ramona Africa and the MOVE Organization
Scission Magazine
The staff of WBAI's show "Where we live"

DOWNLOAD THIS LETTER AND SEND IT TO THE BUREAU OF PRISONS!


PUERTO
                           RICAN POLITICAL PRISONER NORBERTO GONZALEZ CLAUDIODENIED MEDICAL ATTENTION!

¬†
The Committee to Support Avelino and Norberto Gonz√°lez Claudio, The Caribbean and Latin American Coordinating Committee of Puerto Rico, The Human Rights Committee of Puerto Rico, 
The Resistance Collective, The Socialist Front, The New 
School, The Movement for Socialism, The National Hostosiano Independence Movment, The Socialist Movement of Workers, The Puerto Rican Independence Party of Puerto Rico,¬† The Nationalist Party of 
Puerto Rico, and The Revolutionary Party of Puerto 
Rican Workers-Macheteros, and The ProLibertad Freedom Campaign in New York City announce that during the opening of the Festival for Claridad Newspaper in Puerto Rico, they will launch a campaign 
to denounce the inhuman treatment that political prisoner Norberto 
Gonz√°lez Claudio is currently receiving and to demand that he 
receive urgently needed medical attention.¬† The aforementioned 
organizations will request that the House and Senate of 
Puerto Rico approve the concurrent Resolution 500, that has been 
presented by Senator Mar√≠a de Lourdes Santiago in the legislature.
¬†
Norberto Gonz√°lez Claudio was arrested May 10, 2011, for an expropriation that was carried out by the 
Macheteros (Machete Wielders) in 1983 in Harford, Connecticut, as part 
of the struggle for the Independence of Puerto Rico.¬† At the 
time of his arrest Norberto was in an excellent state of health and was wearing an orthopedic show.¬† In the course of his detention it was ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù that Norberto had a lesion in his leg that a biopsy established was 
cancerous.
¬†
His orthopedic shoe was taken away, they refused to provide him with one and they have prevented his 
family from providing him with another one.¬† The little medical 
attention to treat the cancerous lesion has been limited 
and deficient and it has also been revealed that he has not received any treatment for yet another lesion that is potentially 
cancerous.
¬†
At present, Norberto is in the process of being transferred to an institution where he will complete his 
sentence.¬† It has been the custom of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to 
submit it‚Äôs Puerto Rican political prisoners to 
lengthy and discriminatory processes of transfer during which they are 
sent from prison to prison for long periods of 
time.¬† 
¬†
In this process they are kept incommunicado from their families, their lawyers and they are denied the most 
minimum medical attention and the medications that they have been 
prescribed.¬†¬† We recall the treatment that Avelino Gonz√°lez Claudio, Norbertos‚Äô brother and comrade in struggle, who was also 
arrested in excellent health and was released 
suffering from Parkinsons Disease, was denied medications, suffering 
from a possible tumor in his back -- that they refused to 
treat.
¬†
The absence of medical evaluation and treatment for cancerous lesions and the denial of an orthopedic shoe, clearly place the life of Norberto Gonz√°lez Claudio in danger.
¬†
We hereby denounce these flagrant violations of the human rights of this patriot and announce the 
commencement of a petition campaign to bring a halt to this abuse.

This year we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the opening of the 
mass struggle that led to the victory of the Cuban Revolution. On July 
26, 1953, some 160 men and women, led by Fidel Castro and Abel 
Santamaria, launched attacks on the Moncada army barracks in Santiago de Cuba and the nearby Bayamo garrison. The attacks failed and dozens of 
the rebels were murdered after capture and horrible torture, or were 
jailed. But the action paved the way for a revolutionary war led by the 
July 26 Movement, culminating in a popular insurrection that toppled the US-supported Batista dictatorship on January 1, 1959.

Cuban workers and farmers took power out of the hands of the wealthy 
elite and its US imperialist backers, established a government of their 
own, and began to transform society for the benefit of the vast 
majority. For more than five decades, the Cuban people have defended 
their socialist revolution against the economic and political war, and 
other attacks, by eleven successive US Administrations.

Join us to celebrate and to hear what the Cuban Revolution means 
today and why it remains an example for working people ‚Äì and all 
oppressed and exploited humanity ‚Äì around the world, including here in 
the United States.

September 12th, 2013 will mark the 15th year anniversary of the arrest of the Cuban 5; one who is currently on parole in Cuba and four U.S. held Cuban political prisoners and incarcerated for protecting Cuba from U.S. sponsored terrorist actions.

In 2006, President Ricardo Alarcon, of the Cuban Parliament, declared Sept. 12th through October 6th to be a period of time to raise awareness on the case of the Cuban 5. The Popular Education Project to Free the Cuban 5 is committed to building an international movement for the Cuban 5‚Äôs freedom by extending this period of time to be a full month (Sept. 12th-October 12th).

During this month we organize a calendar of events to raise awareness about the Cuban 5 and how people can work for their release! We ask that you support all these events and actions!¬† Our COLLECTIVE action can free these innocent men!

Stephen Kimber‚Äôs new book: ‚ÄúWhat Lies Across the Water- The Real Story of The Cuban Five‚Äù to begin U.S. Tour

As part of the international call to actions to commemorate the 15th 
anniversary of the unjust imprisonment of the Cuban 5, the International Committee for the Freedom of the Cuban 5 is organizing an East Coast 
tour with Canadian author Stephen Kimber who will be presenting his 
newly released book ‚ÄúWhat Lies Across the Water-The Real Story of The 
Cuban Five.‚Äù The book is the result of an exhaustive research effort, 
including the author‚Äôs review of more than 20,000 pages of court records of the longest case in U.S. history, that he presents in a clear and 
objective narrative. Kimber‚Äôs style is riveting from the first page to 
the last as he leads the reader through the twists and turns of their 
mission leading up to the arrest of the Cuban 5. The book shows how 
embedded the case is in U.S. ‚Äì Cuba relations while being so hidden from the U.S. public. Stephen Kimber is a professor of journalism at the 
University of King‚Äôs College in Halifax and an award-winning writer, 
editor and broadcaster.

From September 11-17 Kimber will speak to U.S. audiences in Washington DC, 
Maryland, New York (Manhattan and Brooklyn) and in Boston where American linguist, philosopher, and political scientist Noam Chomsky will be 
speaking with Kimber about the Cuban 5.¬† A second tour is being planned 
to take place on the West Coast in early November.

‚ÄúWhat Lies Across the Water‚Äù represents a new and important tool in 
explaining the Cuban 5, especially to those who know nothing about the 
case. Although activists familiar with the case of the Cuban 5 will find new information, the tour is aimed at reaching new audiences who will 
be moved to end this long injustice.

SCHEDULE AND LOCATION OF STEPHEN KIMBER‚ÄôS PRESENTATIONS 
in New York City:

Saturday September 14
Time: 4:00 pm
Place: BookCourt
Address: 163 Court Street
Brooklyn, New York

Sunday September 15
Time 5:00 pm
Place: Center for Cuban Studies
Cuban Art Space
Address: 231 West 29 St
New York City
Book presentation and Opening Exhibit ‚ÄúI will die the way I lived‚Äù of 
paintings by Antonio Guerrero, one of the Cuban 5. The exhibit includes 
15 watercolors to mark the 15th anniversary of the imprisonment of the 
Cuban 5.

Books will be available at all presentations

Support the Cuban 5 Visa Campaign:

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navenethem Pillay met 
with Adriana Perez and Olga Salanueva, two of the wives of the Cuban 5, 
and stated that she will intercede on their behalf. 

Now that Rene Gonzalez has renounced his citizenship and is completing the 
remainder of his parole in Cuba with Olga Salanueva, this means Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo is the only member of the Cuban 5 who has not seen his wife. 

For 
the past 14 years Gerardo Hernandez‚Äôs wife, Adriana Perez, hasn‚Äôt been 
allowed to visit him.¬† The U.S. asserts that she is a risk to national 
security, despite the fact that the U.S. government has no proof or 
rationale to justify this belief.¬† This separation is a violation of 
Gerardo‚Äôs civil and international rights as a prisoner.

Mail or Fax Ms. Pillay the Project's Letter and hold her accountable to her public statement of support.¬† 

Remind her that the U.S. community supports the Cuban 5 and their wives' visitation rights.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for the case of the Cuban Five
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, 
yesterday, Olga Salanueva, spouse of Ren√© Gonz√°lez, and Adriana P√©rez, 
spouse of Gerardo Hern√°ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and 
Olga explained to the High Commissioner the necessity that this 
organization intercedes in a direct manner on behalf of the case of the 
Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while they requested their support in order to be granted visas to entry the United States to visit their 
husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime 
endured by Rene constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with 
any purpose and unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and 
reunite his relatives. Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that 
requires the political willingness and ethics of the United States 
Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a 
violation to the human rights and expressed this cannot constitute an 
additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to 
this fight and her intention to do whatever is possible to find a 
solution to the case.

Subject:More than 500,000 travelers to Cuba from the US spent more than $1Billion USD in the island<br>
Message:<br><br>
<pre> 

 What is the average cost of a Cuban family to visit the island from the
United States? Only in passports, tickets and costs of currency exchange to
the CUC -the second national currency which is equated with the dollar- will
be an average of $1,000 USD per person, add what is spent on travel and
gifts to the family: do other $1,000 USD this time? 

Multiply that by 500,000 travelers last year and represents $1 Billion
dollars. 

Who says that it is not important what migrants and those who travel from
the United States do not give the Cuban economy?

Meanwhile the slowness of the bureaucracy in Cuba not allowed to more than
200,000 migrants abroad visit their families on the island, which represents
more than 10% of the 2 million of Cuban ÈmigrÈs have vetoed its entry to the
island. 

It is not only an economic issue, but important for the country, since each
year - according to Cuban official figures - plus 47,000 Cubans migrate
every year.

These issues have to be considered now, when the national economy worsens
and not continue postponing decisions that are leaving that in the hands of
the bureaucracy.

his wife Olga Salanueva, this means Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo is the 
only member of the Cuban 5 who has not seen his wife. 

For the 
past 14 years Gerardo Hernandez‚Äôs wife, Adriana Perez, hasn‚Äôt been 
allowed to visit him.¬† The U.S. asserts that she is a risk to national security, despite the fact that the U.S. government has no proof or rationale to 
justify this belief.¬† This separation is a violation of Gerardo‚Äôs civil 
and 
international rights as a prisoner.

Mail or Fax Ms. Pillay the Project's Letter and hold her accountable to her public statement of support.¬† 
Remind her that the U.S. community supports the Cuban 5 and their wives' visitation rights.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Expresses Support for the case of the Cuban Five
Mar. 1, 2013
Reprinted from MinRex

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA, March 1, 2013 - United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Navenethem Pillay, received, 
yesterday, Olga Salanueva, spouse of Ren√© Gonz√°lez, and Adriana P√©rez, 
spouse of Gerardo Hern√°ndez.

During the meeting, Adriana and 
Olga explained to the High Commissioner the necessity that this 
organization intercedes in a direct manner on behalf of the case of the 
Cuban Five for a definitive solution, while they requested their support
 in order to be granted visas to entry the United States to visit their 
husbands.

Olga stressed that the supervised freedom regime 
endured by Rene constitutes a legal absurdity that does not comply with 
any purpose and unnecessarily prohibits his return to his Homeland and 
reunite his relatives. Adriana requested a humanitarian gesture that 
requires the political willingness and ethics of the United States Government.

Mrs. Pillay acknowledged the visa denial as a violation to the human rights and expressed this cannot constitute an additional punishment.

UN Commissioner expressed her support to this fight and her intention 
to do whatever is possible to find a solution to the case.

I. THE COLLECTION ALBUM: "1967-2008", THE FABS BOOK AND THE VIDEO "MONTER" 

The FABS is the main libertarian prog-rock and anarcho-punk band in Norway
and world wide since 1965. FABS is a) mostly a prog-rock group, with a sound
and style a bit similar to a mix of Jimi Hendrix, Cream and Doors -- and
still very much their own -- and b) also with a touch of punk! 

The FABS has released a cd with a collection of 26 recordings from
1967-2008, 10 with Norwegian and 16 with English texts, 72 min. The FABS has
composed all the songs on this album. The cd includes 4 punk cuts, earlier
released on the first Norwegian punk-single from August 1979, by FABS with
Graxelaget. A.o.t. these recordings were in the 1980s frequently played on
Radio Libertaire in Paris. Three of the punk cuts from the cd were played on
the punkradio Aggresso in Bergen, together with an interview with Timian
Sabatini, the primus motor of FABS, in September and October 2008. 

The latest recordings on the cd are "Highway To Anarchy" (2008) and "We're
Gonna Change The World (2004). The cut "Feit F¯deral P¯nk" from the cd was
listed among the best records of the last 6 months and played on the
punkradio Aggresso's X-mas special. Also a book about FABS is released, with
the collection cd and Norway's first rock-video/dvd, "Monter" 28 min.
featuring FABS with the Culture Syndicate from 1968, and interviews,
pictures, different line-ups, lyrics, etc. The book was updated with new
material in September 2009. 

In the early days the band had jobs at Club 7, Rondo, Poppy Club, Drop in
etc. in Oslo, but played mostly in Follo where it was based. The band was
also interviewed several times, a.o.t. in Det Nye. The FABS held a
releaseparty for the book and the collection cd 01.11.2008, and it was a
great, full booked, party. FABS also played live, besides presenting the
collection cd plus the book. 

II. MORE ABOUT THE VIDEO AND UNDERGROUND MOVIE "MONTER"

The 28 min. underground movie "Monter" is a critique of the authoritarian,
red and somewhat brown, social democratic, Marxist, social system and
shopping party in Norway around 1968. It starts with 1. the poem "Monter, a
collection of pictures dedicated to you, dear human being. As in front of a
mirror you rattle in your chain, without hearing that you are fettered in a
glass-house" in Norwegian, and a skeleton, 2. with a red flag on the roof of
the "House of Norway", a brick house, which also is the "Monter" regarding
societal organization, mentality and conciousness, and 3. the guests to a
party arrive. The movie is about a sort of role-playing game, where
participants are involved in an imaginary, dreamlike party, representing the
Marxist authoritarian consumer society, which in turn makes people unfree
and creates emptiness. 

The video mocks at - and comes with ironic remarks about: 1. drug culture,
particularly "sex and drugs and rock'n roll", including alcohol; 2. gambling
and gambling addiction; 3. religion/new-age in general, and especially the
hippie escapist "Flower Power and Quran &amp; Pot" culture, see also point 1; 3.
youth problems including ochlarchy, i.e. mobbing and mob rule; 4. secret
service ochlarchy where agents are hammering on the door to a libertarian in
a public telephone call box, and later two windows of a prison cell appear,
in a polluted slum area in Oslo: "Big Brother Marxist Dirt", and ironic -
"Watching The Dirt From A [Marxist] 'Wonderland'", see also point 7; 5.
manipulative commercials; and 6. other authoritarian tendencies of the
society, including the reduction to a state of stupidity. 7. "Monter" also
includes protests against pollution as, radioactivity, etc., and declares 8.
that we will change the world, create a more libertarian and healthier
system. 

The video ends with a) a light in the darkness, meaning libertarian ideas
and hope, b) an anarchist direct action for improvement of "GAIA", mother
earth, in the form of a globe, shaking it etc. but of course not destroying
the globe, persons or material things, but changing the societal
organization in horizontal direction, and c) a sunrise while playing
"Sunrise For Anarchy - When", plus d) the FABS singing watching the people
in a monter high - and ironic, 'masterpieces' of time. We also see FABS
playing in several parts of the video. 

Norway has since 1994/95 been an anarchy of low degree, but there are plenty
of authoritarian tendencies, not least abroad, so the anarchist social
criticism - and the libertarian struggle for a freer society - of "Monter",
is still relevant.

Apropos large anti-nuke demonstrations world wide lately. The Green
Anarchist International Association,  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/green.html&gt;
GAIA, has a general  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; direct action
called Anarchists Against Nukes, AAN, a libertarian campaign, i.e. without
ochlarchy. The campaign is against both fission nuclear power plants and
nuclear bombs. The campaign has roots back to the FABS' anarchist antinuke
prog-rock record "She Was Strong And Young - Now She's Radioactive" from the
album "Soundtrack From Monter - Anarchist Criticism Of Norway 1968",
recorded in 1968. "She" here mainly means GAIA, "mother earth", say, in the
springtime. The FABS supports AAN, and "... Now She's Radioactive" is the
official anthem of this campaign. 

Monter can be seen on Youtube  &lt;http://youtu.be/wpLiLpOK_sg&gt;

III. THE ALBUM "BALLAD OF EXTERAZY GRAX" 1979

The anarcho-punk rock-opera album "Balladen Om Exterazy Grax" [The Ballad Of
Exterazy Grax] was recorded in 1978 and released on vinyl, an EP-single, on
Folkebladet's @-anarchy label early in August 1979. "Exterazy Grax" is a
surrealistic nick-name for the anarchist movement, and "graxing" means
anarchist action, especially related to culture. The 10 cuts on this album
are also found on the collection cd, but an mp3-version of the vinyl
EP-album is available at several Internet shops. FABS Fanclub has a limited
number of the original vinyl EP, with a hard-hitting anarcho-punk
front-cover, and rear-cover with the Do-It-Yourself word of wisdom: "P¯nk
SjÊl" [Punk Yourself]. The cut "Feit F¯deral P¯nk" (Fat Federal Punk) was
played on NRK-Lydverket/Rilleristing 25.09.2010.

Apropos large animal liberation demonstrations in Norway lately! The Green
Anarchist International Association,  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/green.html&gt;
GAIA, has a general  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/directaction.html&gt; direct action
called Animal Liberation From Abuse, ALFA, an anarchist campaign, i.e.
without ochlarchy. The campaign has roots back to the FABS' anarchist animal
liberation punk record "Villsvinp¯nk" [Wild Boar Punk], one of the records
on "Balladen Om Exterazy Grax" [The Ballad Of Exterazy Grax]. The FABS
supports ALFA, and "Villsvinp¯nk" [Wild Boar Punk] is the official anthem of
this campaign. 

"Villsvinp¯nk" [Wild Boar Punk] also has a deeper and broader anarchist
meaning, regarding liberation from brainwashing religious and political
sects and similar, where the FABS is engaged. Villsvinp¯nk" [Wild Boar Punk]
should here be seen in connection with the next cut on the EP, the punk-song
"Han Er Troende" [He Is A Believer], with an energetic kick-off against
Marxists, religious and other 'believers', also kicking against fanatic and
ochlarchical "animal liberation" groups. Listen to both records at Spotify,
or a part of them at other online shops, also available on cd and vinyl
(very limited number) at the record shop
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/fabshub.html&gt;  THE FABS HUB - Fredensborgv. 17 in
Oslo, and from FABS Fanclub for members. Sing along "Villsvinp¯nk" [Wild
Boar Punk] - it is a very catchy tune, and the other records on "Balladen Om
Exterazy Grax" [The Ballad Of Exterazy Grax], join in the opera. 

IV. FABS LIVE CONCERT IN OSLO 2008, THE SINGLE "PUNK OUT" AND THE ALBUM
"PUNK OUT FOR FANS ONLY" 2009 

Recordings from the live concert at the releaseparty for "1967-2008",
including a.o.t. punk-versions of "We're Gonna Change The World" (part 1 and
2) and the instrumental-punk cuts "Anarchy In Oslo" and "Anarchy Bird And
Butterfly Revisited", were released on a cd in the autumn 2009. This cd
called "Punk Out For Fans Only", also includes two new (2009) compositions,
called "Punk In" and "Punk Out", recorded in June &amp; July 2009, the interview
with Timian Sabatini at the punkradio Aggresso, and some older live
material, punk and some pre-punk recordings. "POFFO" is a collection of the
most punk-rock styled records of the FABS, plus some pre-punk roots back to
1966. The punk-song "Han Er Troende" [He is a believer], with an energetic
kick-off against Marxists, by FABS with Graxelaget, was first recorded in a
version by the FABS in 1970, and is perhaps the first punk-song in the
history. 

"Punk In" and "Punk Out" are both inspired by early Kinks, Sex Pistols,
FABS' opera-punk and the 1966 record Objections Overruled, and given a new
FABS punk-dimension updated per 2009, with a clear anarchist message. Play
the record - click on:  &lt;http://www.anarchy.no/fabs1.mp3&gt; Punk Out. The
Anarchist International's Culture Syndicate has called "Punk Out", "the best
punk record of the world so far in 2009/10" , and "the new year tune 2010".
Feel free to give us a feedback regarding "Punk Out" and tell us what you
think about the record - click on the mailform below, and write and post a
comment!

The FABS held a releaseparty for the cd "Punk Out For Fans Only" 19.09.2009,
and it was a great party, with a "Punk In And Sing Out" program. The cut
"Punk In" from the cd was played on the punkradio Aggresso in Bergen
Wednesday 23.09.2009. 

V. NEW ALBUM IN 2011 "ANARKI I NORGE - ANARCHY IN NORWAY" 

The FABS has released the album "Anarki I Norge - Anarchy In Norway", much
instrumental, but also cuts with lyrics in Norwegian, Spanish and English,
with a.o.t. libertarian progrock, anarcho-punk and anarchist ballad parts.
There is more information about this album at
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/fabs-no.html&gt; FABS' HOMEPAGE and at the Wordfile
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/fabsain1.doc&gt; FABS: Anarki i Norge - Anarchy In
Norway. This is a major composition from the FABS. 


http://www.anarchy.no/fabsain.jpg

VI. THE ALBUM "SOUNDTRACK FROM MONTER - ANARCHIST CRITICISM OF NORWAY 1968"
2010 

FABS has also in 2010 issued: "Soundtrack From Monter - Anarchist Criticism
Of Norway 1968" which have all the original recordings to the 28 minutes
movie/rockvideo "Monter" from 1968, and a new introduction, starting with
the original guitarsolo-riff of "We Will Change The World" and with the
following lyrics: 

Anarchist Introduction

"Since 1945 Norway had a Marxist economic-political system, close to a
one-party state. In 1968 FABS with the Culture Syndicate made the
underground movie and rock-video 'Monter', with a strong anarchist criticism
of the red and somewhat brown socialdemocratic Marxist system, and declaring
'We Will Change The World'. The production of the movie coincided with the
somewhat anarchist revolt in France May 1968, and FABS with the Culture
Syndicate also ran up the anarchist black flag on the roof of their center
in those days. 

It should however take about 26 years before Norway late in 1994, via a
velvet revolutionary change, became libertarian, i.e. an anarchy of low
degree, with about 53 percent degree of anarchism in the middle of 1995.
Norway has been an anarchy since then, and per 2010 has about 54 percent
degree of anarchism. Long live the anarchy!

Here the FABS - the Federalist Anarchist Beat Society, proudly presents the
original soundtrack to: 'Monter, a collection of pictures dedicated to you,
dear human being. As in front of a mirror you rattle in your chain, without
hearing that you are fettered in a glass-house.' Some of this anarchist
criticism is mocking at the authoritarian Marxist system, also with irony.
We hope these recordings, "Soundtrack From Monter - [an] Anarchist Criticism
of Norway 1968", and the movie Monter itself - available on dvd, still will
inspire and contribute to the fight for increased libertarian degree world
wide!"

All the compositions with lyrics of the album "Soundtrack From Monter -
Anarchist Criticism Of Norway 1968" have English texts. The cd includes
among other hits "Theme From Monter", "What People Hate", "Anarchy, Bird and
Butterfly", "Quick Blues", "Watching The Dirt From A Wonderland" and of
course "We Will Change The World". The FABS has composed all the songs on
this album. All in all there are 19 tracks on this album, some with partly
surrealistic lyrics, using words that fit in, but are unknown in ordinary
dictionaries...

Criticism Of Norway 1968", FABS' lineup on this record, the names of all of
the tracks on the cd, etc. click on the Wordfile
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/fabssoundtrack.doc&gt; FABS - Soundtrack From Monter....


VII. SURREALISM AND FABS 

Surrealism means joining dream and fantasy to everyday reality to form an
advanced reality, a surreality. FABS developes surrealism in an anarchist
context, as opposed to Freudian and Marxist surrealism, in this album of
1968, as well as on their anarcho-punk-opera, the Ballad Of Exterazy Grax,
released on a vinyl EP in 1979, recorded in 1978, - and on some other
recordings... 

Surrealism is rooted back to Dadaism and AndrÈ Breton in 1924. When Breton
died in 1966, FABS took over as major spokesmen of surrealism, mostly
related to rock, but also in paintings, the partly surrealistic movie
"Monter" from 1968, etc. FABS' surrealism is a free anarchist surrealism,
extending, but mainly rooted in, the present or future reality.

VIII. FABS AND EXPERIMENTAL ANARCHISTIC NEW MUSIC 

Also several compositions on "Soundtrack From Monter - Anarchist Criticism
Of Norway 1968", with all cuts recorded in 1967 and 68 except the "Anarchist
Introduction" recorded in 2010, are experimental and directly inspired by
Arne Nordheim's music. These compositions are cut no 2. "Prelude of Monter",
no 9. "Short Instrumental And Piano Blues", no 14. "Big Brother Marxist
Dirt", and no 16. "Sunrise For Anarchy - When?"

Norwegian composer Arne Nordheim (1931-2010) made his international
breakthrough at the beginning of the 1960s. Nordheim was a contemporary
"experimental new music" composer who also achieved great recognition beyond
the borders of his own country. Nordheim's name is inextricably linked to
the arrival of musical modernism in Norway. In his roles as composer, music
critic and champion of composers' rights, he ensured that international
trends gained a foothold during a period when Norwegian music was still
influenced by national romanticism and Marxist social democracy. 

Arne Nordheim grew up in a period when all forms of cultural expression in
Norway were expected to reflect our "national identity" and Marxism. Arne
Nordheim rebelled against this fettered approach. Keywords in Nordheim's
music are 1. internationalist communication, 2. expanding the horizon, 3.
soundscapes of infinity, 4. movement and change, 5. peace and human rights,
6. forbidden music - public struggles and 7. the "impossible" is possible.
All in all Nordheim stands for musical anarchy and anarchism, including
optimal order - the highest form of order. Also FABS has a.o.t. signed up to
these 7 keywords within the framework of progressive rock with a touch of
punk, in their free musical anarchy. But FABS goes further, promoting
economical and political/administrative anarchy and anarchism. 

In 2012 FABS started working on a new experimental music album called "The
Wizards Of @@z". 

IX. FABS' LIBERTARIAN MUSIC - AN INSPIRATION FOR ANARCHIST ACTION - DOMESTIC
AND INTERNATIONAL 

In this connection it may be mentioned that a preliminary version of the
first cut of the FABS' "1967-2008" collection-cd "Highway To Anarchy" (2008)
was composed and recorded early in the days of the velvet anarchist
revolution in Norway 1994/95, and was a major inspiration in the fight for
anarchy for the Anarchist Federation of/in Norway (AFIN) and the Anarchist
International Information Service (AIT-AIIS). Other major inspiration
sources were a) cut no 3 of the collection-cd, "Sadom", which may also be
written "S@dom", about an exciting anarchist city, recorded in 1970, and b)
"Fat Federal Punk [Feit F¯deral P¯nk]", as mentioned recorded in 1978, that
calls for a "free socialistic... anarchy". As for "Highway To Anarchy" it
should be noticed that this road or highway is the aim, i.e. from low degree
of anarchy towards higher degree of anarchy. "The road is the aim" is an old
anarchist word of wisdom... 

The records of FABS has a.o.t., as mentioned been played at Radio Libertaire
in Paris, presented at the international anarchist conference in 1984 in
Venice, and FABS-pressreleases have been published by among others the
anarcho-syndicalist CNT-AIT. FABS has been, and is, a major source of
inspiration for the Anarchist International in general, now and before. FABS
was mentioned in International Journal of Anarchism 2(24) 1994 before the
anarchist velvet revolution... The FABS has a long term contract with the
Anarchist International as house band for the organization. 

X. FABS' MUSIC HAS A DEEPER ANARCHIST MEANING - 'SHE' IS 'GAIA' - MOTHER
EARTH, ETC. 

Almost all of the records of FABS have a deeper, anarchist meaning,
reflecting libertarian criticism and views of the world in general, before,
now and in the future, some with surrealistic elements, domestic and
international. "She" and similar usually mean 'GAIA', mother earth, nature -
more or less polluted and with more or less authoritarian societal systems.
This is valid also for the original front-cover of "The Ballad Of Exterazy
Grax" that shows 'GAIA', mother earth, giving rebirth to Exterazy Grax, i.e.
the anarchist movement. Exterazy is reborn with the feet first, ready to
stand up for libertarian rights, and with a punk-style safety pin in the
foot... This is further explained in the song "Exterazy Grax". 

The Sun, Sola in Norwegian, means Anarchy/Anarchism, say, in the composition
"Sunrise For Anarchy, When?" of the Monter-album, in the phrase "som jorda,
som fanger sitt lys av sola" in the title cut of the Grax-album, and the
phrase "det vi trenger er et glimt av liv og sola" in "Feit F¯deral P¯nk" of
the Grax-album.

"Fire" is about the fire of love for freedom, solidarity, equality and other
anarchist principles. The "Book Of Love" is about anarchist words of wisdom
etc., and the often "unknown" writers, before, now and in the future. "Very
Heavy" and the surrealistic "I'm Sad" are about the feelings of a person in
an authoritarian society, "Very Heavy" also with some "golden age dreams".
"Big Brother Marxist Dirt" is about secret service ochlarchy (mob rule)
against libertarians, etc. "Stone and rubble" in the mind means anger,
"high" means enlightened, and "high up in the sky", "stone high" and similar
mean an anarchist consciousness, say, in "Darkness". 

"Fever stone" means "high up in the sky" with the blood sat in fever by and
for anarchism, irritated and angry over authoritarian tendencies, say, in
"Theme From Monter". "Silent war" means anarchist class struggle, and "it
all" an authoritarian system, in "What People Hate". "Three" usually
indicates the "third way", social-individualist anarchism, say, in the
phrase "going for three days". "Red Dough" is about remuneration in a
Marxist, authoritarian, system. "My Extasy" is about an escapistic type of
person and policy, and libertarian criticism in this connection. 

The expression "Uria Puria" represents an advanced reality, a surreality, of
the latin 'urea pura', meaning 'unadulterated clean piss in crystallized
form' - it is also the name of a homeopathic swindle medicin. And the song
"Uria Puria" on the Grax-album is an anarchist criticism of brain-dead rock
and pop, and the ignorant fans of bands playing politically meaningless,
say, "love and kiss", songs, and following trendy fashion. FABS also use the
term "ochlarchist" in "Punk In" and "Punk Out", where ochlarchy is meaning
mob rule broadly defined. You don't find the word ochlarchist in the
ordinary Orwellian Big Brother newspeak dictionaries, but it is central to
anarchim. 1. Anarchy and ochlarchy and 2. anarchists and
ochlarchists/ochlarchs, are opposites. Etc. etc.

at Platekompaniet, iTtunes Store, Napster, Amazon.com and other online
record-shops. We recommend Platekompaniet, because at this online shop you
dont need to download anything to get access, just:

1. Click on  &lt;http://www.platekompaniet.no/&gt; Platekompaniet - The
Diskcompany. 2. Search for FABS via the search (s¯k) option at
Platekompaniet, 3. Click on the album (i.e the picture of the cover) you
want to hear or buy, and you will get a list of the cuts on this album, then
4. click on (&gt;) to the left of the cut you want to listen to. 5. You can
listen free to the beginning (30 sec.) of a cut for sale, without buying it.
But FABS Fanclub of course hope you will buy records and in this way support
the Federalist Anarchist Beat Society - FABS. 

Also the major recordings of our friend Atle Skift with his band Pink Dirt,
are for sale at Platekompaniet and other online record-shops. FABS and Pink
Dirt records are also available on WiMP and Spotify. FABS released as
mentioned the first Norwegian punk-single in August 1979, with a.o.t. "Feit
F¯deral P¯nk" [Fat Federal Punk] and "Han Er Troende" [He Is A Believer],
kicking against Marxist and other 'believers', and Pink Dirt released the
second in September 1979 with "Hey Sir". 

NB! The hard-hitting anarchist Track 3 on FABS: "Punk Out For Fans Only",
punk-radio Aggresso's interview with Timian Sabatini, is 'omitted' in the
version of the album at Platekompaniet and other Internet shops. However you
can listen to the interview by clicking on
&lt;http://www.anarchy.no/fabs-poffo-3.mp3&gt; FABS: POFFO Track 3. By the way,
this interview about the punk-movement and the anarchist connection, is
called historic by the National Library in Norway (Nasjonalbiblioteket). And
the original hard-hitting anarcho-punk cover of "Balladen Om Exterazy Grax"
is 'changed' a bit to a more 'mild' version at Platekompaniet and other
Internet shops. However you can buy the EP with the original cover from FABS
Fanclub. Thus, regarding Internet-shops, a slight touch of Arne Nordheim's
keyword 6. 'forbidden music - public struggles', is going on vis-a-vis the
FABS. But we can all live with it... the beat goes on - and the fight for a)
higher degree of anarchy in Norway and b) less authoritarian systems world
wide, is going on at full force with the music.
